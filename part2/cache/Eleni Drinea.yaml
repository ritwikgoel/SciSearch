        "title": "Delay with network coding and feedback", "abstract": "We consider
        the problem of minimizing delay when broadcasting over erasure channels with
        feedback. A sender wishes to communicate the same set of \u00b5 messages to
        several receivers over separate erasure channels. The sender can broadcast
        a single message or a combination (encoding) of messages at each timestep.
        Receivers provide feedback as to whether the transmission was received. If
        at some time step a receiver cannot identify a new message, delay is incurred.
        Our notion of delay is motivated by real-time applications that request progressively
        refined input, such as the successive refinement of an image encoded using
        multiple description coding. Our setup is novel because it combines coding
        techniques with feedback information to the end of minimizing delay. It allows
        \u0398(\u00b5) benefits as compared to previous approaches for offline algorithms,
        while feedback allows online algorithms to achieve smaller delay than online
        algorithms without feedback. Our main complexity results are that the offline
        minimization problem is NP-hard when the sender only schedules single messages
        and that the general problem remains NP-hard even when coding is allowed.
        However we show that coding does offer delay and complexity gains over scheduling.
        We also discuss online heuristics and evaluate their performance through simulations.",

        "title": "Lower bounds for the capacity of channels with i.i.d. deletions
        and insertions", "abstract": "Consider the simplest channel which introduces
        deletions; or binary i.i.d. deletion channel: each transmitted bit is independently
        deleted with probability d. The capacity C del of this channel remains unknown
        since Dobrushin''s introduction of the problem in 1967. The topic of this
        thesis is provable lower bounds for Cdel by developping Shannon-style theorems.
        Although this implies that the codes considered in this work are of no practical
        interest, practical codes are not required to prove capacity bounds. Moreover,
        existing lower bounds for the capacity of this channel arising from the study
        of the performance of efficient codes are significantly below the theoretical
        bounds we prove. \nPrevious theoretical approaches to lower bound C del implicitly
        attempt typical set decoding. The improvements in our work arise in two ways.
        First, we explicitly consider typical set decoding, thus establishing that
        one clear way to improve capacity lower bounds is to refine the definitions
        of the typical sets. We start by refining the definition of the typical received
        sequence after the i.i.d. deletion channel, by observing further structural
        properties of the received sequence. Then we refine the decoding algorithm
        by using a more sophisticated set of received sequences jointly typical with
        a codeword. Second, we introduce a new framework for generating codewords,
        which allows consideration of more general codebooks, while using our new
        definitions of typical sets; the analysis in previous frameworks was not amenable
        to such generalizations. Our approach allows for dramatic improvements on
        the lower bounds. Moreover, for d > 0.65, we surpass a combinatorial upper
        bound for channels with an asymptotic fraction of d synchronization errors.
        \nAnother advantage of our framework is that it can be applied to analyze
        more general channels. Specifically, we consider the i.i.d. channel with deletions
        and insertions, where insertions only occur in the form of copies. We provide
        a general lower bound for the capacity of this channel (under the assumption
        of geometrically decreasing tails for the insertion distribution). We then
        use this result to show that Cdel > (1- d)/9, via a reduction argument.",
