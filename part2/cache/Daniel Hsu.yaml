        "Introduction\nIn 2013, the U.S. Army Surgeon General implemented the Performance
        Triad (P3), an educational initiative to improve health-related behaviors
        of soldiers throughout the U.S. Army. The components of P3 are Sleep, Activity,
        and Nutrition with tenet behaviors for each component. This study reports
        the results of the 2015 U.S. Army Medical Corps survey regarding physician
        knowledge and adherence to the tenet behaviors of P3.\n\n\nMethods\nIn 2015,
        an anonymous survey was sent to all active duty U.S. Army physicians to assess
        demographic information, work hours, and knowledge of and adherence to P3.
        The survey assessed the tenets of P3 with questions about the following topics:
        obtaining 8 h of sleep per day; performing at least 2 d of resistance training
        and 1 day of agility training per week; re-fueling 30-60 min after exercise;
        incorporating at least 150 min of moderate and 75 min of vigorous aerobic
        exercise per week; going caffeine free 6 h before bedtime; eating at least
        8 servings of fruits and vegetables per day; and getting 15,000 steps per
        day. For each question, there were four response options which ranged from
        \"Always\" to \"Never.\" A positive response to the questionnaire was defined
        as answering frequently or always. The responses were analyzed by comparison
        of several physician categories utilizing descriptive statistics and multivariable
        analysis.\n\n\nResults\nSurveys were completed by 1,003 of approximately 4,500
        U.S. Army physicians. 79.1% of the respondents were male. Staff physicians
        made up 834 (83.6%) of the respondents compared with 164 (16.4%) physicians
        in training. Overall 25% of respondents were adherent to the sleep tenet,
        45% to the exercise tenet, and 38% to the nutrition tenet. Reported work hours
        were significantly higher in physicians in training compared with staff physicians
        (p < 0.001). About 28.4% of staff reported a positive response to obtaining
        at least 8 h of sleep per night, compared with 12.7% of residents/fellows.
        In multivariable analyses, better sleep was associated with being a staff
        physician [odds ratio 2.4 (95% confidence interval 1.40-4.13)], working fewer
        hours per week [1.75 (1.37-2.25)], and belief in supervisor adherence to P3
        [2.04 (1.59-2.56)]. Increased exercise was associated with male gender [2.09
        (1.45-3.02)], being a staff physician [1.63 (1.09-2.43)], and belief in supervisor
        adherence to P3 [1.43 (1.18-1.75)]. Positive response to the nutrition tenet
        was associated with belief in supervisor adherence to P3 [1.23 (1.01-1.49)].\n\n\nConclusion\nOverall,
        U.S. Army physicians are most adherent to the exercise tenet and least adherent
        to the sleep tenet of P3; this is consistent with the military culture. Work
        hours seem to affect wellness behaviors. Specifically, physicians who work
        fewer hours are more likely to report obtaining 8 h of sleep per day and exercise
        on a regular basis. Importantly, belief in supervisor adherence to P3 was
        associated with better adherence to P3, suggesting that physician leadership
        has a positive effect on wellness behaviors. This suggests a role for similar
        wellness programs in civilian healthcare institutions. Future research should
        also include changes in health system policies to motivate physician wellness
        behaviors.", "venue": "Military Medicine", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

        growth and reversed with ciclesonide", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Introduction:
        This case series intends to highlight the association between decreased linear
        growth velocity and adrenal suppression in patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids
        for asthma. A potential treatment option is also discussed. Adrenal suppression
        secondary to inhaled corticosteroids has previously been reported and is often
        underrecognized. A decrease in linear height velocity has also been associated
        with inhaled corticosteroids. However, a decrease in height velocity has not
        been shown to predict adrenal suppression. Case study: This case series of
        15 patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids for control of asthma were noted
        to have a decrease in linear growth velocity ultimately associated with adrenal
        suppression. A change in inhaled corticosteroid to ciclesonide led to recovery
        of adrenal function without impacting asthma control. Results: Chart review
        from a pediatric pulmonology clinic was performed. Growth parameters and laboratory
        studies were recorded and analyzed. A mean decrease in height standard deviation
        score in the year prior to diagnosis of adrenal suppression was \u22120.59,
        \u22120.11, and \u22120.18, in pre-puberty, peri-puberty, and post-puberty
        patients, respectively. After ciclesonide therapy was initiated, a mean change
        in height standard deviation score of +0.40, +0.13, and \u22120.13, was noted
        for pre-puberty, peri-puberty, and post-puberty patients, respectively. A
        change in growth velocity of +5.3 cm/yr, +2.1 cm/yr, and \u22121.9 cm/yr,
        was noted for pre-puberty, peri-puberty, and post-puberty patients, respectively,
        after starting ciclesonide. Conclusions: Height velocity should be monitored
        closely during routine asthma visits to identify potential adrenal suppression
        associated with inhaled corticosteroids use. Ciclesonide is a good option
        for asthma treatment that allows for adrenal recovery.", "venue": "Journal

        Fibrosis Lung Infection and Inflammation", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Cystic fibrosis
        (CF) is characterized by an excessive neutrophilic inflammatory response within
        the airway as a result of defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane receptor
        (CFTR) expression and function. Interleukin-17A induces airway neutrophilia
        and mucin production associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization,
        which is associated with the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis. The objectives
        of this study were to use the preclinical murine model of cystic fibrosis
        lung infection and inflammation to investigate the role of IL-17 in CF lung
        pathophysiology and explore therapeutic intervention with a focus on IL-17.
        Cftr-deficient mice (CF mice) and wild-type mice (WT mice) infected with P.
        aeruginosa had robust IL-17 production early in the infection associated with
        a persistent elevated inflammatory response. Intratracheal administration
        of IL-17 provoked a neutrophilic response in the airways of WT and CF animals
        which was similar to that observed with P. aeruginosa infection. The neutralization
        of IL-17 prior to infection significantly improved the outcomes in the CF
        mice, suggesting that IL-17 may be a therapeutic target. We demonstrate in
        this report that the pathophysiological contribution of IL-17 may be due to
        the induction of chemokines from the epithelium which is augmented by a deficiency
        of Cftr and ongoing inflammation. These studies demonstrate the in vivo contribution
        of IL-17 in cystic fibrosis lung disease and the therapeutic validity of attenuating
        IL-17 activity in cystic fibrosis.", "venue": "Infection and Immunity", "year":

        "title": "Evaluation of Interpretation Strategies and Substantial Bronchodilator
        Response in Pediatric Patients With Normal Baseline Spirometry", "abstract":
        "BACKGROUND: Controversy exists regarding the best method to interpret pediatric
        spirometry. There is also controversy regarding the benefit of performing
        post-bronchodilator spirometry after normal baseline spirometry. This study
        compares the use of lower limit of normal (LLN) against percent of predicted
        (PP) in the interpretation of spirometry. We also investigate the occurrence
        of a substantial bronchodilator response for patients who received post-bronchodilator
        spirometry. METHODS: Spirometric tests performed in the pediatric clinic at
        San Antonio Military Medical Center were retrospectively reviewed. Results
        of spirometry were compared using LLN and PP for interpretation. Abnormal
        spirometry was defined as a low FEV1 or low FEV1/FVC, indicating evidence
        of airway obstruction. The presence of a substantial bronchodilator response
        was recorded and the results were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 242 tests, 212 normal
        and 30 abnormal tests were reported using the LLN interpretation strategy.
        Using the PP interpretation strategy, there was a significant difference in
        the number of normal (183) and abnormal (59) tests, when compared to the LLN
        (P < .001). No significant difference between LLN versus PP interpretation
        strategies was noted in the number of baseline tests, normal or abnormal,
        that demonstrated a substantial response to bronchodilator. Of the subjects
        with normal baseline spirometry, 10% (PP) and 12% (LLN) had a substantial
        bronchodilator response. An abnormal baseline spirometry was more likely to
        have a substantial response to bronchodilator, compared to normal baseline
        spirometry (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of LLN for interpretation is more
        likely to report a test as normal, when compared to the PP interpretation
        strategy. Although a substantial bronchodilator response is more likely to
        occur following abnormal baseline spirometry, 10\u201312% of subjects with
        normal baseline spirometry showed a substantial bronchodilator response. This
        suggests that normal baseline spirometry may miss reversible airway obstruction,
        which is a hallmark of asthma.", "venue": "Respiratory care", "year": 2012,

        in macrophages and its implications (37.45)", "abstract": "\n Galectin-3 is
        a \u03b2-galactoside-binding animal lectin expressed in epithelial cells and
        various immune cell types. In macrophages, It has been shown to be a positive
        regulator for Fc\u03b3R-mediated phagocytosis and a negative regulator for
        LPS-mediated inflammation. However, its role in macrophages during infection
        process remains unclear. Here we investigated the role of galectin-3 in macrophages
        during the infection of a Gram-positive bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes
        (LM). Survival of LM in galectin-3-deficient (gal3-/-) bone marrow-derived
        macrophages (BMM) was impaired compared to that in galectin-3 wild-type (gal3+/+)
        BMM. This was not due to a difference in the production of bactericidal mediators
        nitric oxide and superoxide anion, nor a difference in the efficiency of LM
        escape from phagosomes between gal3+/+ or gal3-/- BMM. Interestingly, by immunofluorescence
        staining we detected colocalization of intracellular galectin-3 with LM at
        as early as 15 min after infection. The colocalization proportion peaked at
        30 min post-infection, coinciding with the timing of LM escape. In vitro incubation
        of LM with recombinant galectin-3 was shown to promote LM growth. Based on
        these findings, we hypothesize that LM utilizes intracellular galectin-3 to
        improve its own survival and growth after escape into the host cytosol.",

        agent of Chagas'' disease, the thymus undergoes intense atrophy followed by
        a premature escape of CD4+CD8+ immature cortical thymocytes. Here we report
        a pivotal role for the endogenous lectin galectin-3 in accelerating death
        of thymocytes and migration of these cells away from the thymus after T. cruzi
        infection. We observed a pronounced increase in galectin-3 expression that
        paralleled the extensive depletion of CD4+CD8+ immature thymocytes after infection.
        In vitro, recombinant galectin-3 induced increased levels of death in cortical
        immature thymocytes. Consistent with the role of galectin-3 in promoting cell
        death, thymuses from gal-3-/- mice did not show cortical thymocyte depletion
        after parasite infection in vivo. In addition, galectin-3 accelerated laminin-driven
        CD4+CD8+ thymocyte migration in vitro and in vivo induced exportation of CD4+CD8+
        cells from the thymus to the peripheral compartment. Our findings provide
        evidence of a novel role for galectin-3 in the regulation of thymus physiology
        and identify a potential mechanism based on protein-glycan interactions in
        thymic atrophy associated with acute T. cruzi infection.", "venue": "American

        "\n \n \n Rapid onset obesity with hypothalamic dysregulation, hypoventilation,
        and autonomic dysregulation (ROHHAD) is a rare disorder associated with sleep
        disordered breathing. Patients often have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and
        nocturnal hypoventilation (NH). We present a case with a unique sleep disordered
        breathing pattern demonstrating both severe central and obstructive sleep
        apnea demonstrated on two separate polysomnograms with no evidence of significant
        NH.\n \n \n \n The patient is a now 8 year old girl who was initially diagnosed
        with ROHHAD in October 2020 at age 5 years with symptoms of rapid weight gain,
        hypothalamic dysfunction (hyperprolactinemia), and autonomic dysfunction (recurrent
        fever, and hypertension). Diagnostic polysomnography in May 2020 demonstrated
        severe OSA (oAHI 23.4/hr) as well as central sleep apnea (CAI 63.9/hr). The
        SaO2 nadir was 88% with 15 minutes spent below 90%. There was no evidence
        of NH, however the CO2 was greater than 50 mmHg for 9.5% of total sleep time.
        Subsequent titration study recommended BPAP ST of 14/10 cmH20 with back up
        rate (BUR) of 12 bpm. The patient had a repeat split night study in May of
        2022 at age 7 years. During the diagnostic portion, she demonstrated persistent
        severe OSA (oAHI 39/hr) and central sleep apnea (CAI 21/hr). There was no
        evidence of NH with a max TCO2 of 50 mmHg and CO2 > 50 mmHg for 0.2% of total
        sleep time. BPAP ST of 18/10 cmH20 with BUR of 12 bpm led to resolution of
        obstructive and central apnea events.\n \n \n \n ROHHAD remains a rare disease
        which is often associated with sleep disordered breathing. While there have
        been rare reports of CSA in ROHHAD, there have been none of this severity.
        CSA may be a representation of autonomic dysfunction, and previous literature
        has described central pauses in breathing in ROHHAD patients while awake.
        While she did not have evidence of hypoventilation on either polysomnogram,
        which is one of the hallmarks of this disease, it has been described that
        nocturnal hypoventilation may develop later in the course of the disease.
        Thus, it remains important to routinely screen patients with polysomnograms
        as their sleep disordered breathing evolves.\n \n \n \n \u00a0\n", "venue":

        management of patients with extracranial carotid artery stenosis remains controversial.
        Randomized controlled studies established the value of carotid endarterectomy

        For patients with carotid stenosis, optimal medical therapy includes antiplatelet
        agents, antihypertensives, and lipid-lowering medications along with lifestyle
        modifications. Some studies and experts have challenged these treatment methods

        the treated vessels were revascularized to TIMI 2 (54%) or 3 (33%) as compared
        with 82% reported in the Pivotal trial. Nine procedural serious adverse events
        were reported in 157 patients (5.7%). All-cause mortality was 20% (32/157),
        and 41% had a mRS of \u22642 at 90-day follow-up as compared with only 25%
        in the Pivotal trial. Patients who were successfully revascularized by the
        Penumbra system had significantly better outcomes than those who were not.
        Conclusion Initial post-market experience of the Penumbra system revealed
        that the revascularization rate and safety profile of the device are comparable
        to those reported in the Pivotal trial. However, the proportion of patients
        who had good functional outcome was higher than expected.", "venue": "Journal

        a carotid artery pseudoaneurysm in an emergent setting requiring craniotomy
        for a concurrent subdural empyema. They describe the case of a 14-year-old
        boy with sinusitis and bifrontal subdural empyema who underwent transsphenoidal
        exploration at an outside hospital. An injury to the right cavernous segment
        of the ICA caused torrential epistaxis. Bleeding was successfully controlled
        by inflating a Foley balloon catheter within the sphenoid sinus, and the patient
        was transferred to the authors'' institution. Emergent angiography showed
        a dissection of the right cavernous carotid artery, with a large pseudoaneurysm
        projecting into the sphenoid sinus at the site of arterial injury. The right
        internal carotid artery was obliterated using pushable coils distally and
        an endovascular plug proximally. The endovascular plug enabled the authors
        to successfully exclude the pseudoaneurysm from the circulation. The patient
        subsequently underwent an emergent bifrontal craniotomy for evacuation of
        a left frontotemporal subdural empyema and exenteration of both frontal sinuses.
        He made a complete neurological recovery. Endovascular large-vessel sacrifice,
        obviating the need for numerous coils and antiplatelet therapy, has a role
        in the setting of selected acute neurosurgical emergencies necessitating craniotomy.
        The endovascular plug is a useful adjunct in such circumstances as the device
        can be deployed rapidly, safely, and effectively.", "venue": "Journal of Neurosurgery:

        "Background and purpose Endovascular techniques are frequently employed to
        treat large artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We sought to
        determine the predictors and clinical impact of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH)
        after endovascular therapy. Methods Retrospective analysis of consecutive
        patients presenting to 13 high volume stroke centers with AIS due to proximal
        occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent endovascular treatment
        within 8\u2005h from symptom onset. Logistic regression was performed to determine
        the variables associated with ICH, hemorrhagic infarction (HI), and parenchymal
        hematomas (PHs), as well as 90 day poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score
        \u22653) and mortality. Results There were a total of 363 ICHs (overall rate
        32.3%; HI=267, 24%; PH=96, 8.5%) among the 1122 study patients (mean age 67\u00b115\u2005years;
        median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 17 (IQR 13\u201320)).
        Independent predictors for HI included diabetes mellitus (OR 2.27, 95% CI
        (1.58 to 3.26), p<0.0001), preprocedure IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
        (1.43 (1.03 to 2.08), p<0.037), Merci thrombectomy (1.47 (1.02 to 2.12), p<0.032),
        and longer time to puncture (1.001 (1.00 to 1.002), p<0.026). Patients with
        atrial fibrillation (1.61 (1.01 to 2.55), p<0.045) had a higher risk of PH
        while the use of IA tPA (0.57 (0.35 to 0.90), p<0.008) was associated with
        lower chances of PH. Both the presence of HI (2.23 (1.53 to 3.25), p<0.0001)
        and PH (6.24 (3.06 to 12.75), p<0.0001) were associated with poor functional
        outcomes; however, only PH was associated with higher mortality (3.53 (2.19
        to 5.68), p<0.0001). Conclusions Greater understanding about the predictors
        and consequences of ICH post endovascular stroke therapy is essential to improve
        risk assessment, patient selection/clinical outcomes, and early prognostication.
        Our data suggest that patients with atrial fibrillation are particularly prone
        to severe ICH and question the \u2018benign\u2019 nature of HI suggested by

        coronary stents have been employed in the endovascular management of ischemic
        cerebrovascular disease, where rapid and precise stenting with angioplasty
        may be performed in a patient with minimal or no sedation. The Medtronic Driver\u00ae
        balloon-mounted stent is known to have excellent trackability and deliverability,
        making it a viable tool in the armamentarium of the neurointerventional surgeon.
        Methods: Retrospective review of 46 patients who underwent endovascular revascularization
        utilizing Medtronic Driver\u00ae stent from 2003-2011. Characteristics analyzed
        were patient demographics, lesion location, etiology of vascular lesion, degree
        of stenosis, extent of revascularization, short-term complications, and clinical
        outcome. Results: Out of 46 patients with 51 Driver\u00ae stents studied,
        21 were female and age of patients ranged from 37 to 91 years. The treatment
        data comprised of 22 internal carotid artery stents (19 patients) 1 common
        carotid artery stent, 25 vertebal artery stents (20 patients), and 3 basilar
        artery stents. 18 out of 51 stents were intracranial, including 7 ICA, 3 basilar
        and 8 vertebral artery. Extracranial stents comprised of 1 CCA, 15 ICA and
        17 vertebral artery stents. Etiology of lesion included 41 stroke or TIA with
        symptomatic stenosis, 1 instent restenosis, and 4 dissections. Angiographically
        5 patients had occluded vessels, 5 had 4 deaths from non-procedure medical
        complications. Conclusion: This study presents the largest single institution
        review of the Medtronic Driver\u00ae balloon- mounted coronary stent for use
        in neurointervention. The authors have demonstrated technical feasibility
        of the stent system and satisfactory revascularization in a variety of clinical

        aneurysms", "abstract": "Since its inception, coil embolization of cerebral
        aneurysms was designed and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
        for aneurysms considered to be high risk for microsurgical clip ligation,
        but it is now increasingly considered as the first line of treatment. The
        techniques for endovascular aneurysm treatment have evolved: new devices have
        been developed that allow treatment of aneurysms with anatomy previously unfavorable
        for endovascular occlusion, and indications for endovascular treatment have
        expanded. Nevertheless, intrasaccular coil embolization has become the mainstay
        of endovascular aneurysm treatment at the present time, and the medical literature
        demonstrates better outcomes with treatment by coiling than with clipping
        in specific patient groups.1\u20133 In a recent scientific statement from
        the American Heart Association (AHA),4 either endovascular or microsurgical
        treatment of cerebral aneurysms amenable to treatment was indicated with AHA
        Class I level of recommendation for ruptured aneurysms and Class IIa for unruptured
        aneurysms. In both groups the evidence suggests that the benefit of treatment
        outweighs the risks. A multidisciplinary team experienced in vascular microneurosurgery,
        neurocritical care and neurointerventional surgery most appropriately applies
        best techniques to the management of intracranial aneurysms. The Neurovascular
        Coalition Writing Group has previously published recommendations for training
        and competence in cerebrovascular intervention with a joint statement.5 \n\nThe
        progressive adoption of endovascular techniques for the treatment of the majority
        of cerebral aneurysms and the availability of new endovascular devices do
        not necessarily correspond to continuously improving outcomes. A recent study
        comparing patient outcomes in New York State showed that patient outcomes
        have not improved significantly over the last decade despite the association
        of endovascular coiling with better patient outcomes compared with clipping
        for patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs).6 This finding
        raises the concern that the quality of endovascular treatment is at a plateau,
        thus justifying the need \u2026", "venue": "Journal of NeuroInterventional

        "Spinal vascular malformations include a heterogeneous group of pathological/anatomical
        entities with congenital and acquired etiologies that induce spinal cord dysfunction,
        primarily through intradural extramedullary drainage and enlargement of the
        coronal venous plexus, resulting in venous hypertension and/or a direct mass
        effect. These lesions are rare, comprising approximately 5% of neurovascular
        disorders. Clinical manifestations are pain or venous congestive myelopathy,
        usually in the thoracolumbar spine. This may progress to hemorrhage from vascular
        thrombosis and necrotizing myelopathy (Foix\u2013Alajouanine syndrome).1 Due
        to the differing hemodynamics, pathophysiology, and treatment considerations,
        a thorough knowledge of the various types of spinal dural arteriovenous fistulas
        (dAVFs) and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is essential.\n\nThe first
        descriptions of the single coiled dural vessel form of spinal dAVF with intradural
        extramedullary venous drainage were published by Kendall and Logue in 1977.2
        Type I spinal dAVFs (also known as angioma racemosum venosum) are the most
        common and comprise 56% of all spinal lesions in the spinal vascular malformation
        database at the University of Toronto.3 They occur nearly 3\u20134 times as
        frequently in men. These generally low flow lesions may be further divided
        into type I-A (single feeder dAVFs) and I-B (\u22652 arterial feeders).4 Although
        they are typically supplied via radicular arteries, anterior spinal artery
        feeders have also been reported.5 Type II spinal AVMs (also known as angioma
        racemosum arteriovenosum) are characterized by a compact, glomus-type, totally
        intramedullary nidus. They have no gender predominance but are symptomatic
        in younger patients. Type III (juvenile or metameric) spinal AVMs are highly
        complex intramedullary lesions that frequently extend into the extramedullary,
        epidural, or even extraspinal compartments. Vascular \u2026", "venue": "Journal

        "title": "CT-guided cryoablation for palliation of secondary trigeminal neuralgia
        from head and neck malignancy", "abstract": "Background Facial pain is a common
        presentation secondary to tumoral invasion, rendering an individual unable
        to perform basic activities such as eating and talking. Cryotherapy may be
        appropriate in patients seeking immediate pain relief for trigeminal neuralgia
        (TN) near the end of life with its minimal invasiveness and procedural morbidity.
        While cryosurgery has been effectively demonstrated in the treatment of primary
        TN, this study is unique as it is the first documented use of CT guidance
        and treatment of secondary TN using percutaneous cryoablation. Aim To perform
        and report experience with CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation, a palliative
        treatment for TN secondary to recurrent invasive head and neck carcinoma,
        in patients previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery
        with the goal of improving functional status and quality of life. Methods
        Palliative cryoablation procedures performed under CT guidance on recurrent
        head and neck malignancy between September 2010 and June 2011 were retrospectively
        analyzed. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia or conscious
        sedation. For each patient, 1\u20132 cryoprobes were placed in the tumor and
        two or four freeze-thaw cycles were performed. Patients were evaluated for
        facial pain relief immediately after treatment by telephone follow-up. Results
        Three patients underwent treatment for three masses using CT-guided percutaneous
        cryoablation. On imaging, technical success was achieved in all cases with
        hypodense ice formation encompassing symptomatic lesions on the CT scan. No
        procedural complications were encountered with post-procedure pain relief
        and reduction in required pain medication noted in all patients. One patient
        had 1\u2005month of pain relief before the symptoms returned. Conclusion CT-guided
        percutaneous cryoablation is an efficient minimally invasive method for the
        palliative treatment of TN secondary to recurrent invasive head and neck carcinoma
        as a result of direct tumoral invasion of the extracranial divisions of the
        trigeminal nerve. Patients meeting the therapeutic criteria of individuals
        treated for musculoskeletal metastatic lesions may benefit from this treatment.
        The results suggest it may not currently be a curative technique as one patient''s
        symptoms returned, but it could prove useful as an adjunct to current palliative
        therapies with minimal invasiveness and procedural morbidity, especially in
        patients seeking pain palliation, improved functional status and improved
        quality of life near the end of life.", "venue": "Journal of NeuroInterventional

        "Background and purpose Endovascular treatment (EVT) has emerged as an alternative
        therapeutic strategy for the treatment of intracranial fusiform aneurysms
        (IFAs), but little is known about the safety and efficacy of deconstructive
        and reconstructive methods, especially in patients presenting with subarachnoid
        hemorrhage (SAH). The purpose of this study is to describe the radiological
        and clinical outcomes in patients with IFAs undergoing EVT. Methods A retrospective
        analysis was conducted of 18 patients undergoing EVT of IFAs, 13 of whom (72.2%)
        presented with SAH. Radiological outcomes were characterized by the presence
        of parent vessel opacification and aneurysmal remnants for patients undergoing
        deconstructive and reconstructive EVT, respectively. Clinical outcomes were
        characterized by the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Contingency analysis of factors
        associated with clinical outcomes in patients with ruptured aneurysms was
        conducted. Results Technical success was achieved in 17 of the 18 patients
        (94.4%), with 10 (55.6%) undergoing reconstructive EVT and eight (44.4%) undergoing
        deconstructive EVT. For patients with SAH, favorable clinical outcomes were
        achieved in 9/13 (69.2%), with 3/6 (50.0%) undergoing reconstructive EVT and
        6/7 (85.7%) undergoing deconstructive EVT. Among patients with ruptured aneurysms,
        only Hunt\u2013Hess grade \u22653 was associated with an unfavorable clinical
        outcome (p=0.007). Favorable clinical outcomes were seen in all five patients
        with unruptured aneurysms. Conclusion Both deconstructive and reconstructive
        EVT were found to be safe and effective in patients with unruptured aneurysms.
        Reconstructive EVT may be associated with a higher incidence of poor clinical
        outcomes in patients presenting with high-grade SAH.", "venue": "Journal of

        "title": "Standard of practice: endovascular treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis",
        "abstract": "Background Symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD)
        worldwide represents one of the most prevalent causes of stroke. When severe,
        studies show that it has a very high risk for recurrent stroke, highlighting
        the need for effective preventative strategies. The mainstay of treatment
        has been medical therapy and is of critical importance in all patients with
        this disease. Endovascular therapy is also a possible therapeutic option but
        much remains to be defined in terms of best techniques and patient selection.
        This guideline will serve as recommendations for diagnosis and endovascular
        treatment of patients with ICAD. Methods A literature review was performed
        to extract published literature regarding ICAD, published from 2000 to 2011.
        Evidence was evaluated and classified according to American Heart Association
        (AHA)/American Stroke Association standard. Recommendations are made based
        on available evidence assessed by the Standards Committee of the Society of
        NeuroInterventional Surgery. The assessment was based on guidelines for evidence
        based medicine proposed by the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Stroke
        Council of the AHA and the University of Oxford, Centre for Evidence Based
        Medicine (CEBM). Results 59 publications were identified. The SAMMPRIS study
        is the only prospective, randomized, controlled trial available and is given
        an AHA level B designation, AAN class II and CEBM level 1b. The Stenting of
        Symptomatic Atherosclerotic Lesions in the Vertebral or Intracranial arteries
        (SSYLVIA) trial was a prospective, non-randomized study with the outcome assessment
        made by a non-operator study neurologist, allowing an AHA level B, AAN class
        III and CEBM level 2. The remaining studies were uncontrolled or did not have
        objective outcome measurement, and are thus classified as AHA level C, AAN
        class IV and CEBM level 4. Conclusion Medical management with combination
        aspirin and clopidogrel for 3\u2005months and aggressive risk factor modification
        is the firstline therapy for patients with symptomatic ICAD. Endovascular
        angioplasty with or without stenting is a possible therapeutic option for
        selected patients with symptomatic ICAD. Further studies are necessary to
        define appropriate patient selection and the best therapeutic approach for
        various subsets of patients.", "venue": "Journal of NeuroInterventional Surgery",

        report the incidence and risk factors for contrast-induced nephropathy after
        the use of iodinated contrast for endovascular treatment of acute ischemic
        stroke. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed in 194 consecutive
        patients who underwent endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke between
        January 2006 and January 2011. No patients were excluded from treatment for
        elevated creatinine (Cr). Each patient received approximately 150\u2005ml
        intra-arterial non-ionic low-osmolar contrast agent (Optiray 320) during the
        endovascular procedure. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) was defined according
        to the Acute Kidney Injury Network criteria as a relative increase of serum
        Cr 50% above the baseline or an absolute increase of 0.3\u2005mg/dl at 48\u2005h
        following the endovascular procedure. Results Of 194 patients (mean age 65\u00b114\u2005years),
        52% were women (n=100) and 25% (n=48) were diabetic. Baseline Cr levels for
        191 patients ranged between 0.4 and 2.7\u2005mg/dl. Three patients on chronic
        hemodialysis had baseline Cr levels ranging between 5.3 and 6.1\u2005mg/dl.
        Cr was \u22641.5\u2005mg/dl in 163 patients (84%) and \u2265\u20091.5\u2005mg/dl
        in 31 (16%). Three of the 191 patients (1.5%) developed CIN as noted from
        Cr measurements between baseline and within 48\u2005h. One patient who developed
        an elevated Cr level had a known history of chronic renal insufficiency (Cr
        >\u20091.5\u2005mg/dl) and two had baseline Cr levels within the normal range.
        An additional CT angiogram was obtained in 44 patients, none of which developed
        CIN. Female gender and diabetes were not associated with a higher risk of
        developing CIN. Conclusions The risk of developing CIN is low among patients
        with acute stroke who undergo emergency endovascular treatment. Treatment
        of acute stroke should be performed irrespective of Cr levels.", "venue":

        the atypical combination of both matched defect and IAT. Successful recanalization
        (SR), favorable clinical response (FCR) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage
        (SICH) were defined respectively as thrombolysis in cerebral infarction score
        \u22652 after IAT, discharge National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)
        0\u20131/\u22658 point decrease from baseline and intracranial hemorrhage
        in infarct zone with \u22654 point increase in NIHSS Score within 24\u2005h
        of IAT. Results Median (range) baseline NIHSS score was 16.5 (6\u201322).
        Median (range) time delays from symptom onset to MRI and to IAT initiation
        were 200 (83\u2013240) and 267.5 (160\u2013360)\u2005min, respectively. Median
        (range) values of diffusion and perfusion lesion volumes were 119.5 (24\u2013205)
        and 118 (18\u2013207)\u2005ml. Out of eight patients, one (12.5%) achieved
        FCR, four (50%) had SICH and five (62.5%) died. Out of six patients with SR,
        one achieved FCR and four had SICH and died, and of two patients without SR,
        none had FCR or SICH and one died. Conclusion Our data on rare patients with
        matched defects who nevertheless had attempted rescue with IAT confirm a poor
        risk\u2013benefit ratio generated by low favorable responses and high mortality
        rates, especially in large ischemic lesions.", "venue": "Journal of NeuroInterventional

        on perfusion studies: a single center experience", "abstract": "Background
        CT Perfusion or MR perfusion studies are often used to evaluate patients who
        presents with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS). Little published data are available
        regarding the real-time use of perfusion imaging to guide endovascular management.
        Objective To evaluate the role of perfusion imaging in selection and decisions
        for endovascular management in AIS patients. Methods Retrospective chart review
        was performed from prospectively collected database of patients with AIS who
        were treated with endovascular therapy from April 2010 to December 2010. Patients
        were divided into two groups: Group 1: included 23 patients who had initial
        perfusion study performed to decide endovascular management by exclusion of
        candidates with large matched defects, 10 males and 13 females with mean age
        of 68.13 (range 39\u201386), mean NIHSS 16.4 (range 6\u201326) and Group 2:
        included 21 patients who were treated with endovascular management without
        perfusion imaging screening, 10 males and 11 females with mean age 64.86 (range
        34\u201389), mean NIHSS 15.7 (range 0\u201342). The primary outcome measures
        following the intervention were intracranial hemorrhage rate and mortality
        rate. Results Group 1: All patients had lesions in the anterior circulation.
        Four patients received a combination of IV and IA tPA. Two received intravenous
        tPA, two received intra-arterial tPA. MERCI was used in seven patients and
        Penumbra device was used in seven patients. Post procedure hemorrhage was
        13% (n=3). The mortality rate was 4.3% (n=1). Group 2: 15 patients had lesions
        in the anterior circulation and six patients in posterior circulation. Four
        patients received a combination of IV and IA tPA. Three received intravenous
        tPA, six received intra-arterial tPA. MERCI was used in eight patients and
        Penumbra device was used in 14 patients. Post procedure hemorrhage was 30%
        (n=6). The mortality rate was 24% (n=5). Conclusions Although not a matched
        population, we note a trend toward a lower rate of symptomatic hemorrhage
        and mortality in patients who were selected based on perfusion study for endovascular
        therapy. Further prospective trials are warranted to evaluate role of perfusion
        based studies in selecting patients for endovascular management.", "venue":

        the prognostic significance of blood glucose level at admission (BGA) and
        change in blood glucose at 48 hours from the baseline value (CG48) in nondiabetic
        and diabetic patients before and after endovascular therapy for acute ischemic
        stroke (AIS).\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe BGA and CG48 data were analyzed in 614 patients
        with AIS who received endovascular therapy at 7 US centers between 2006 and
        2009. Data reviewed included demographics, stroke risk factors, diabetic status,
        National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score at presentation,
        recanalization grade, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rate, and 90-day outcomes
        (mortality rate and modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6 [defined as poor outcome]).
        Variables with p values < 0.2 in univariate analysis were included in a binary
        logistic regression model for independent predictors of 90-day outcomes.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe
        mean patient age was 67.3 years, the median NIHSS score was 16, and 27% of
        patients had diabetes. In nondiabetic patients, BGA \u2265 116 mg/dl (\u2265
        6.4 mmol/L) and failure of glucose level to drop > 30 mg/dl (> 1.7 mmol/L)
        from the admission value were both significant predictors of 90-day poor outcome
        and death (p < 0.001). In patients with diabetes, BGA \u2265 116 mg/dl (\u2265
        6.4 mmol/L) was an independent predictor of poor outcome (p = 0.001). The
        CG48 was not a predictor of outcome in diabetic patients. A simplified 6-point

        in the first 48 hours after AIS intervention correlated with poor 90-day outcomes
        in nondiabetic patients. The BRANCH scale shows promise as a simple prognostication
        tool after endovascular therapy for AIS, and it merits prospective validation.",

        "title": "Intra-arterial Thrombolysis or Stent Placement During Endovascular
        Treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke Leads to the Highest Recanalization Rate:
        Results of a Multicenter Retrospective Study", "abstract": "BACKGROUND:Reperfusion
        therapy for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is rapidly evolving, with the development
        of multiple endovascular modalities that can be used alone or in combination.
        OBJECTIVE:To determine which pharmacologic or mechanical modality may be associated
        with increased rates of recanalization. METHODS:A cohort of 1122 patients
        with AIS involving the anterior circulation treated at 13 stroke centers underwent
        intra-arterial (IA) therapy within 8 hours of symptom onset. Demographic information,
        admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), mechanical and
        pharmacologic treatments used, recanalization grade, and hemorrhagic complications
        were recorded. RESULTS:The mean age was 67 \u00b1 16 years and the median
        NIHSS was 17. The sites of arterial occlusion before treatment were M1 middle
        cerebral artery (MCA) in 561 (50%) patients, carotid terminus in 214 (19%)
        patients, M2 MCA in 171 (15%) patients, tandem occlusions in 141 (13%) patients,
        and isolated extracranial internal carotid artery occlusion in 35 (3%) patients.
        Therapeutic interventions included multimodal therapy in 584 (52%) patients,
        pharmacologic therapy only in 264 (24%) patients, and mechanical therapy only
        in 274 (24%) patients. Patients treated with multimodal therapy had a significantly
        higher Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 2 or 3 recanalization rate (435
        patients [74%]) compared with pharmacologic therapy only (160 patients, [61%])
        or mechanical only therapy (173 patients [63%]), P < .001. In binary logistic
        regression modeling, independent predictors of Thrombolysis in Myocardial
        Infarction 2 or 3 recanalization were use of IA thrombolytic OR 1.58 (1.21-2.08),
        P < .001 and stent deployment 1.91 (1.23-2.96), P < .001. CONCLUSION:Multimodal
        therapy has significantly higher recanalization rates compared with pharmacologic
        or mechanical therapy. Among the individual treatment modalities, stent deployment
        or IA thrombolytics increase the chance of recanalization.", "venue": "Neurosurgery",

        intra-arterial interventions in patients with atrial fibrillation in acute
        stroke settings. Background Cardioembolic source is a major cause of ischemic
        stroke. However, there is limited experience regarding the use of combined
        mechanical and chemical intra-arterial therapy in acute stroke patients with
        atrial fibrillation. Design and methods Retrospective chart review was performed
        on 45 patients with atrial fibrillation who underwent interventional acute
        stroke treatment from January 2006 to October 2009. The study included 29
        men and 16 women, with a mean age of 72\u2005years. The mean National Institutes
        of Health Stroke Scale was 17 at presentation. The primary outcome measures
        included for analysis following the intervention were intracranial hemorrhage
        (ICH), mortality and recanalization rates as well as modified Ranking Score
        (mRS). Results The mean time from onset of symptoms to beginning of the angiographic
        procedure was within 3\u20136\u2005h. 20 patients received 0.9\u2005mg/kg
        intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) for 40\u2005min as a bridging
        therapy prior to any endovascular management. Large vessel occlusions were
        noted in more than 73% of the patients (n=33) Thirty patients received intra-arterial
        tPA and a mechanical device was used in 16 patients during endovascular intervention.
        Mechanical thrombectomy devices utilized were MERCI and Penumbra in 12 and
        four patients, respectively. Rate of postprocedure symptomatic ICH was 15%
        (n=7). Nine patients died during the hospital stay (20%). Partial to complete
        recanalization (TIMI 2 or 3) was achieved in 25 patients (55%). mRS \u22643
        was achieved in 23 patients (51%) at the time of discharge. Conclusions Combined

        therapy for acute ischemic stroke is associated with worse outcomes", "abstract":
        "Background and purpose The use of endovascular techniques to treat large
        artery occlusion in acute ischemic stroke has become more frequently employed
        as a treatment option. We sought to determine the predictors of intracranial
        hemorrhage after these procedures were performed. Methods This is a retrospective
        review of data from 13 high volume stroke centers that perform endovascular
        treatments for acute ischemic stroke. Patients with anterior circulation strokes
        treated under 8\u2005h from symptom onset with endovascular therapy were included.
        Hemorrhages were classified as parenchymal hematoma (PH) types 1 and 2 and
        hemorrhagic infarction (HI) types 1 and 2. Patients with PH bleeds were considered
        symptomatic and HI bleeds were asymptomatic. Binary logistic regression modeling
        was performed to determine the variables associated with symptomatic and asymptomatic
        hemorrhages after correcting for multiple comparisons. Results A total of
        1122 patients met the inclusion criterion for this study. Mean age for the
        cohort was 67\u00b115\u2005years with a median National Institutes of Health
        Stroke Scale (NIHSS) of 17 (IQR 13\u201320). The distribution for thrombus
        location at the initiation of endovascular therapy was as follows: M1 segment
        of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) 561 (50%), carotid terminus 214 (19%),
        M2 MCA 171 (15%), tandem occlusions 141 (13%) and isolated extracranial internal
        carotid artery occlusion 35 (3%). Parenchymal hematomas occurred in 96 (8.5%)
        patients and HI in 265 (24%) patients. There were no variables associated
        with symptomatic hemorrhages while the following variables were predictors
        of asymptomatic hemorrhage: diabetes mellitus (OR 2.02; 95% CI 1.46 to 2.79;
        p<0.0001), preprocedural use of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
        (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.21; p<0.003), intra-arterial thrombolytic infusion
        (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.10; p<0.01), higher baseline NIHSS (OR 1.032, 95%
        CI 1.001 to 1.06; p<0.04) and use of the Merci device (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.18
        to 2.48; p<0.003). After controlling for age, baseline NIHSS, recanalization
        status, PH, type of sedation and site of occlusion, the presence of asymptomatic
        hemorrhage was associated with a poor clinical outcome (OR 2.23, 1.53 to 3.23;
        p<0.0001). Conclusions Diabetic patients and those who have been treated with
        intravenous tPA prior to the procedure or intraprocedural use of thrombolytics
        or the Merci device appear to be at a higher risk for asymptomatic hemorrhage.
        Moreover, patients with asymptomatic hemorrhage appear to be at a higher risk
        for a worse clinical outcome at the 90 day follow-up.", "venue": "Journal

        "title": "P-009\u2005Trend towards using mechanical thrombectomy devices in
        stroke interventions in recent years", "abstract": "Purpose Mechanical thrombectomy
        is a promising new modality of interventional stroke treatment. The use of
        these devices has been steadily increasing over the past 2\u20133\u2005years.
        In recent years, multiple trials have been published establishing the efficacy
        of mechanical thrombectomy devices in achieving successful vascular recanalization
        and improved outcomes. We reviewed single institution data analyzing increasing
        use of mechanical thrombectomy devices and related outcomes in recent years.
        Methods Retrospective chart review was performed on 146 consecutive patients
        who underwent interventional acute stroke treatment from January 2006 to October
        2009. Data were analyzed to compare use of mechanical thrombectomy devices
        (MERCI and Penumbra) and outcomes for each individual year. The primary outcome
        measures compared were mortality, recanalization rate and modified Ranking
        Score (mRS). Results For all patients included, data were analyzed for each
        year separately. In 2006, all patients (n=11) were treated with IA (intra-arterial)
        tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) (100%) and none received mechanical thrombectomy,
        with recanalization rates (TIMI=2/3), mortality and mRS \u22642 of 54%, 18%
        and 45%, respectively. Total patients treated were 49, 47 and 39 in 2007,
        2008 and 2009, respectively. In 2007, 44 were treated with IA tPA (89%) and
        nine (18%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy with recanalization rates (TIMI=2/3),
        mortality and mRS \u22642 of 65%, 18% and 53%, respectively. In 2008, 34 were
        treated with IA tPA (72%) and 21 (44%) underwent mechanical thrombectomy with
        recanalization rates (TIMI=2/3), mortality and mRS \u22642 of 59%, 25% and
        48%, respectively. In 2009, 30 were treated with IA tPA (76%) and 28 (71%)
        underwent mechanical thrombectomy with recanalization rates (TIMI=2/3), mortality
        and mRS \u22642 of 71%, 23% and 41%, respectively Conclusion There is an increasing
        trend towards using mechanical thrombectomy devices over recent years resulting
        in better recanalization rates. However, no trend towards improved outcomes
        or reduced mortality was observed in our single institution series. This could
        be due to inclusion of patients with older age, higher National Institutes
        of Health Stroke Scale scores and expanded treatment time windows for interventional
        stroke therapy in recent years.Abstract P-009 Figure 1", "venue": "Journal

        "abstract": "Purpose The extent to which acute ischemic stroke patients''
        functional outcome can be improved by mechanical thrombectomy remains controversial.
        This is due in part to the lack of appropriate control groups in trials with
        these devices. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the novel
        mechanical thrombectomy device, the Penumbra System, on patient 90\u2005day
        outcome and compare the results with an appropriate control group from peer
        reviewed literature. Methods and materials This study was a retrospective
        case review of 89 consecutive patients at seven international centers with
        occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) who were treated with the Penumbra
        System. All patients reviewed presented to the hospital within 8\u2005h of
        symptom onset with a treatable MCA occlusion (TIMI 0 or 1). The primary end
        point was good functional outcome, as defined by a modified Rankin Scale (mRS)
        score of 2 or less at 90\u2005days postprocedure. Published results from the
        placebo patients in the PROACT II trial were used as the historical control.
        Results Mean baseline values at enrollment were: age 66\u2005years, median
        National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 15 (range 5\u201325),
        51% were females and the median time from symptom onset to arterial puncture
        was 4.5\u2005h. After use of the Penumbra System, 88% of the treated vessels
        were revascularized to TIMI 2 or 3. At discharge, 37% of patients had an NIHSS
        score of 0\u20131 or an improvement of at least 10 points. Six procedural
        serious adverse effects were reported in 89 patients (7%). There were a total
        of five (6%) symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhages reported at 24\u2005h.
        At 90\u2005days, all cause mortality was 15%. Of the 70 patients who either
        died or reached the 90 day follow-up, 36 (51%) had mRS scores of \u22652.

        of this study was to assess the initial post-market experience of the device
        and how it is compared with the Penumbra Pivotal trial used to support the
        510k application. Methods A retrospective case review of 157 consecutive patients
        treated with the Penumbra system at seven international centers was performed.
        Primary endpoints were revascularization of the target vessel (TIMI score
        of 2 or 3), good functional outcome as defined by a modified Rankin scale
        (mRS) score of \u22642 and incidence of procedural serious adverse events.
        Results were compared with those of the Penumbra pivotal trial. Results A
        total of 157 vessels were treated. Mean baseline values at enrollment were:

        Case Report", "abstract": "BACKGROUND The Pipeline embolization device (PED)
        is a new endoluminal construct designed to exclude aneurysms from the parent
        cerebrovasculature. We report the very late (>1 year) thrombosis of a PED
        construct placed for the treatment of a left vertebral aneurysm. CLINICAL
        PRESENTATION A patient with an occluded right vertebral artery and a large,
        fusiform intracranial left vertebral artery aneurysm was treated with PED
        and coil reconstruction. A durable, complete occlusion of the aneurysm was
        confirmed with control angiography at 1 year. The patient remained neurologically
        normal for 23 months until he experienced a transient visual disturbance followed
        weeks later by a minor brainstem stroke. INTERVENTION Imaging evaluation showed
        thrombosis of the PED construct with complete occlusion of the left vertebral
        artery. After this stroke, he was initially treated with dual antiplatelet
        therapy and was then converted to warfarin. The patient remained neurologically
        stable for 5 months until he experienced progressive basilar thrombosis that
        ultimately resulted in a fatal stroke. CONCLUSION The PED represents a promising
        new endovascular technology for the treatment of cerebral aneurysms; however,
        as an investigational device, long-term follow-up data are sparse at this
        point. The etiology of the very late thrombosis of the PED construct in this
        case remains unknown; however, this report underscores the need for a continued,
        careful systematic evaluation and close long-term follow-up of treated patients.",

        Patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy (IAT) for acute ischemic stroke
        receive either general anesthesia (GA) or conscious sedation. GA may delay
        time to treatment, whereas conscious sedation may result in patient movement
        and compromise the safety of the procedure. We sought to determine whether
        there were differences in safety and outcomes in GA patients before initiation
        of IAT. Methods\u2014 A cohort of 980 patients at 12 stroke centers underwent
        IAT for acute stroke between 2005 and 2009. Only patients with anterior circulation
        strokes due to large-vessel occlusion were included in the study. A binary
        logistic-regression model was used to determine independent predictors of
        good outcome and death. Results\u2014 The mean age was 66\u00b115 years and
        median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score was 17 (interquartile

        hemorrhage rate was 9.2%. GA was used in 44% of patients with no differences
        in intracranial hemorrhage rates when compared with the conscious sedation
        group. The use of GA was associated with poorer neurologic outcome at 90 days
        (odds ratio=2.33; 95% CI, 1.63\u20133.44; P<0.0001) and higher mortality (odds
        ratio=1.68; 95% CI, 1.23\u20132.30; P<0.0001) compared with conscious sedation.
        Conclusions\u2014 Patients placed under GA during IAT for anterior circulation
        stroke appear to have a higher chance of poor neurologic outcome and mortality.
        There do not appear to be differences in hemorrhagic complications between
        the 2 groups. Future clinical trials with IAT can help elucidate the etiology
        of the differences in outcomes.", "venue": "Stroke", "year": 2010, "referenceCount":

        and objective Cerebral aneurysm with endovascular coil embolization is a well
        established treatment modality. Endovascular therapy can be complex with primary
        coiling versus stent or balloon assisted coil embolization. Limited data exist
        that compares the safety and clinical outcome of balloon versus stent assisted
        coiling of cerebral aneurysm. This is a substudy of the large Endovascular
        Coil Embolization of Small Unruptured Cerebral Aneurysm (ECOSA) study comparing
        stenting versus balloon assisted coiling in a large multicenter cohort. Method
        Data from 11 US medical centers are collected on technical and procedural
        outcome of unruptured small cerebral aneurysm coiling (<7\u2005mm) with the
        selection for comparison the subgroups of stenting and balloon assisted coiling.
        Data on clinical baseline variables and periprocedural outcome of thromboembolic
        event (TEE) and procedural rupture is collected and compared between the two
        groups in univariate and multivariate analysis Results 351 patients were identified
        to have an adjunctive device use for coiling cerebral aneurysm. 247 underwent
        stent assisted coiling and 104 underwent balloon assisted coiling. Mean age
        of the stenting group was 55.6\u00b111 versus 53.5\u00b112.5 for the balloon
        group (p value 0.06). The majority were women with 75.7% in the stenting and
        77.8% in the balloon group, and the majority were white (73.4%). Mean size
        of the aneurysm in the stenting group was 5\u2005mm\u00b11.2\u2005mm versus
        4.6\u20051.2\u2005mm for the balloon (p=0.003). Overall events rate of all
        TEE and rupture complications were 4.2% for the stenting versus 1.6% for the
        balloon (p=0.02); there was a difference in the symptomatic complication of
        TEE or rupture. Conclusion Contrary to the other literature, in our retrospective
        large case series comparing stent versus balloon assisted coiling, the event

        Trichomonas vaginalis to human vaginal epithelial cells (hVECs) was previously
        shown to involve surface lipoglycans and several reputed adhesins on the parasite.
        Herein, we report some new observations on the host-parasite interactions
        of adherent versus nonadherent T. vaginalis isolates to hVECs. The binding
        of the TH17 adherent isolate to hVECs exhibited an initial discrete phase
        followed by an aggregation phase inhibited by lactose. T. vaginalis infection
        immediately induced surface expression of galectin-1 and -3, with extracellular
        amounts in the spent medium initially decreasing and then increasing thereafter
        over the next 60 min. Extracellular galectin-1 and -3 were detected on the
        parasite surface but only the TH17 adherent isolate could uptake galectin-3
        via the lysosomes. Only the adherent isolate could morphologically transform
        from the round-up flagellate with numerous transient protrusions into a flat
        amoeboid form on contact with the solid surface. Cytochalasin D challenge
        revealed that actin organization was essential to parasite morphogenesis and
        cytoadherence. Real-time microscopy showed that parasite exploring and anchoring
        on hVECs via the axostyle may be required for initial cytoadherence. Together,
        the parasite cytoskeleton behaviors may collaborate with cell surface adhesion
        molecules for cytoadherence. The nonadherent isolate migrated faster than
        the adherent isolate, with motility transiently increasing in the presence
        of hVECs. Meanwhile, differential histone acetylation was detected between
        the two isolates. Also, TH17 without Mycoplasma symbiosis suggests that symbiont
        might not determine TH17 innate cytoadherence. Our findings regarding distinctive
        host-parasite interactions of the isolates may provide novel insights into

        the composition of membrane lipid rafts in CD4 T cells.", "abstract": "Galectin-3
        (GAL3) is a \u03b2-galactoside-binding lectin expressed in CD4 T cells infected
        with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). GAL3 promotes HIV-1 budding by
        associating with ALIX and Gag p6. GAL3 has been shown to localize in membrane
        lipid rafts in dendritic cells and positively regulate cell migration. HIV-1
        spreads between T cells by forming supramolecular structures (virological
        synapses [VSs]), whose integrity depends on lipid rafts. Here, we addressed
        the potential role of GAL3 in cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 in CD4 T
        cells. GAL3 expressed in donor cells was more important for facilitating HIV-1
        cell-to-cell transfer than GAL3 expressed in target cells. GAL3 was found
        to be co-transferred with Gag from HIV-1-positive donor to HIV-1-negative
        target T cells. HIV-1 infection induced translocation of GAL3 together with
        Gag to the cell-cell interfaces and colocalize with GM1, where GAL3 facilitated
        VS formation. GAL3 regulated the coordinated transfer of Gag and flotillin-1
        into plasma membrane fractions. Finally, depletion of GAL3 reduced the cholesterol
        levels in membrane lipid rafts in CD4 T cells. These findings provide evidence
        that endogenous GAL3 stimulates lipid raft components and facilitates intercellular
        HIV-1 transfer among CD4 T cells, offering another pathway by which GAL3 regulates
        HIV-1 infection. These findings may inform the treatment of HIV-1 infection
        based on targeting GAL3 to modulate lipid rafts.", "venue": "Glycobiology",

        were not posted on social media. During this time period, 163 total articles
        of the three types used for social media (Case Report, Case Presentation,
        and Photo Vignette) were published in DOJ and 15 were promoted via SoMe. Utilization
        of SoMe demonstrated a significant (P<0.0001) positive effect with regards
        to both views (175.5\u00b116.4) and downloads (31.5\u00b14.0) over matched
        articles not published on SoMe. Similar trends illustrating the positive effect
        of SoMe on readership have been previously observed in the field of dermatology
        as well as other medical specialties. Most direct accessions to articles arrived
        via Instagram rather than Twitter, diverging from previous studies on SoMe
        use in medical journals. Social media, in particular Instagram, can be a successful
        platform to enhance the exposure of peer-reviewed medical information.", "venue":

        Ulcers", "abstract": "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) induce
        ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach and small intestine.
        NSAID-induced gastric ulcers can be prevented by taking acid-neutralizing/inhibitory
        drugs and cytoprotective agents. In contrast, there are no medicines to control
        NSAID-induced small intestinal ulcers, which are accompanied by a mucosal
        invasion of bacteria and subsequent activation of immune cells. Galectin-3
        (Gal3), an endogenous lectin, has anti-microbial and pro-inflammatory functions.
        In the small intestine, since Gal3 is highly expressed in epithelial cells
        constitutively and macrophages inducibly, the Gal3 level can affect microbiota
        composition and macrophage activation. We hypothesized that the modulation
        of Gal3 expression could be beneficial in NSAID-induced intestinal ulcers.
        Using Gal3 knockout (Gal3KO) mice, we determined whether Gal3 could be a therapeutic
        target in NSAID-induced intestinal ulcers. Following the administration of
        indomethacin, an NSAID, we found that small intestinal ulcers were less severe
        in Gal3KO mice than in wild-type (WT) mice. We also found that the composition
        of intestinal microbiota was different between WT and Gal3KO mice and that
        bactericidal antibiotic polymyxin B treatment significantly suppressed NSAID-induced
        ulcers. Furthermore, clodronate, a macrophage modulator, attenuated NSAID-induced
        ulcers. Therefore, Gal3 could be an exacerbating factor in NSAID-induced intestinal
        ulcers by affecting the intestinal microbiota population and macrophage activity.
        Inhibition of Gal3 may be a therapeutic strategy in NSAID-induced intestinal
        ulcers. Clinical Trial Registration www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT03832946.",

        knockdown in these cells elevated the production of IL-6 and IL-8 and enhanced
        ERK signaling when the cells were stimulated with IL-17A. Galectin-7 attenuated
        IL-17A-induced production of inflammatory mediators by keratinocytes via the
        miR-146a-ERK pathway. Moreover, galectin-7-deficient mice showed enhanced
        epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation in response to intradermal IL-23
        injection. We identified fluvastatin as an inducer of galectin-7 expression
        by connectivity map (cMAP) analysis, confirmed this effect in keratinocytes,
        and demonstrated that fluvastatin attenuated IL-6 and IL-8 production induced
        by IL-17A. Thus, we validate a role of galectin-7 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,
        in both epidermal hyperplasia and keratinocyte-mediated inflammatory responses,
        and formulated a rationale for the use of statins in the treatment of psoriasis.",

        "While glycans are generally displayed on the cell surface or confined within
        the lumen of organelles, they can become exposed to the cytosolic milieu upon
        disruption of organelle membrane by various stresses or pathogens. Galectins
        are a family of \u03b2-galactoside-binding animal lectins synthesized and
        predominantly localized in the cytosol. Recent research indicates that some
        galectins may act as \"danger signal sensors\" by detecting unusual exposure
        of glycans to the cytosol. Galectin-8 was shown to promote antibacterial autophagy
        by recognizing host glycans on ruptured vacuolar membranes and interacting
        with the autophagy adaptor protein NDP52. Galectin-3 also accumulates at damaged
        phagosomes containing bacteria; however, its functional consequence remains
        obscure. By studying mouse macrophages infected with Listeria monocytogenes
        (LM), we showed that endogenous galectin-3 protects intracellular LM by suppressing
        the autophagic response through a host N-glycan-dependent mechanism. Knock
        out of the galectin-3 gene resulted in enhanced LC3 recruitment to LM and
        decreased bacterial replication, a phenotype recapitulated when Galectin-8-deficient
        macrophages were depleted of N-glycans. Moreover, we explored the concept
        that alterations in cell surface glycosylation by extracellular factors can
        be deciphered by cytosolic galectins during the process of phagocytosis/endocytosis,
        followed by rupture of phagosomal/endosomal membrane. Notably, treatment of
        cells with sialidase, which removes sialic acid from glycans, resulted in
        increased galectin-3 accumulation and decreased galectin-8 recruitment at
        damaged phagosomes, and led to a stronger anti-autophagic response. Our findings
        demonstrate that cytosolic galectins may sense changes in glycosylation at
        the cell surface and modulate cellular response through differential recognition
        of glycans on ruptured phagosomal membranes.", "venue": "Glycobiology", "year":

        A crucial question pertains to a role of IL-10 as a tumorigenic factor, or
        just a marker of advanced disease in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Herein,
        we measured significantly elevated IL-10 mRNA in a cohort of skin samples
        of patients with CTCL. Increased IL-10 was also detected in the tumor microenvironment
        of an established inflammation-dependent murine model of using MBL2 T lymphoma
        cells. Conditioned media from MBL2 cells was able to stimulate IL-10 production
        in bone marrow-derived macrophages in an IL-4-dependent manner. Implanted
        MBL2 T-cell lymphomas in IL-10KO mice were 50% smaller, accompanied by decreased
        numbers of infiltrating macrophages and reduced efficiency of M2-polarization
        compared with wild-type mice. With anti-IL-10R mAb treatment, both wild-type
        tumor-bearing mice and IL-10KO mice exhibited a further growth inhibition.
        Our data indicate that targeting IL-10 signaling with neutralizing antibodies
        to IL-10 or its receptor may have a great potential for advanced CTCL therapy.",

        of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) pathogenesis and other cholestatic liver
        diseases. Galectin\u20103 (Gal3), a pleiotropic lectin, is produced by monocytic
        cells and macrophages. However, its role in PBC has not been addressed. We
        hypothesized that Gal3 is a key to induce NOD\u2010like receptor family, pyrin
        domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in macrophages and in turn to propagate
        proinflammatory IL\u201017 signaling. In liver tissues from patients with
        PBC and dnTGF\u2010\u03b2RII mice, a model of autoimmune cholangitis, the
        expression of Gal3, NLRP3, and the adaptor protein adaptor apoptosis\u2010associated
        speck like protein was induced, with the downs tream activation of caspase\u20101
        and IL\u20101\u03b2. Inwild\u2010typehepaticmacrophages, deoxycholic acid
        induced the association of Gal3 and NLRP3with direct activation of the inflammasome,

        of Gal3 in the pathogenesis of cholestatic liver injury, we generated dnTGF\u2010\u03b2RII/galectin\u20103\u2010/
        (dn/Gal3\u2010/) mice, which showed impaired inflammasome activation alongwith
        significantly improved inflammation and fibrosis. Taken together, our data

        autoimmune cholangitis, mediating the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and

        of galectin-3 (Gal3) in gastric infection by Helicobacter pylori. We first
        demonstrated that Gal3 was selectively expressed by gastric surface epithelial
        cells and abundantly secreted into the surface mucus layer. We next inoculated
        H. pylori Sydney strain 1 into wild-type (WT) and Gal3-deficient mice using
        a stomach tube. At 2 weeks postinoculation, the bacterial cells were mostly
        trapped within the surface mucus layer in WT mice. In sharp contrast, they
        infiltrated deep into the gastric glands in Gal3-deficient mice. Bacterial
        loads in the gastric tissues were also much higher in Gal3-deficient mice
        than in WT mice. At 6 months postinoculation, H. pylori had successfully colonized
        within the gastric glands of both WT and Gal3-deficient mice, although the
        bacterial loads were still higher in the latter. Furthermore, large lymphoid
        clusters mostly consisting of B cells were frequently observed in the gastric
        submucosa of Gal3-deficient mice. In vitro, peritoneal macrophages from Gal3-deficient
        mice were inefficient in killing engulfed H. pylori. Furthermore, recombinant
        Gal3 not only induced rapid aggregation of H. pylori but also exerted a potent
        bactericidal effect on H. pylori as revealed by propidium iodide uptake and
        a morphological shift from spiral to coccoid form. However, a minor fraction
        of bacterial cells, probably transient phase variants of Gal3-binding sugar

        transfer (VIR1P.1000)", "abstract": "\n Galectin-3 contains \u03b2-galactoside-binding
        domain and is mainly expressed in immune cells and epithelial cells. Galectin-3
        is known to play regulatory roles in the immune system to defend against pathogens.
        Previous studies showed that Alix is a host factor employed by HIV-1 for its
        replication. Here, we report that galectin-3 is another such factor. We have
        reported that galectin-3 is translocated to the immunological synapse and
        affects T cell cytokine production. We have now studied the role of galectin-3
        in the virological synapse (VS). Our data showed that HIV-1 infection induces
        galectin-3 expression in primary CD4 T cells. Immunofluorescence imaging showed
        that galectin-3 is translocted to the virological synapse and co-localized
        with Gag and Env at the cell-to-cell junction of HIV-1-infected cells. We
        have studied the effects of galectin-3 in the VS by using fluorescent-tagged
        HIV-1 and incubation of fluorescent-labeled T cells with galectin-3 knockeddown
        (KD). Our analysis indicates that HIV-1 transmission efficacy is significantly
        attenuated in galectin-3 KD cells comparing to galectin-3-expressing wild
        type cells. Our analysis also shows that Alix plays a role in promoting cell-to-cell
        transfer of HIV-1. Further analysis indicate that effects of galectin-3 in
        effector cells is likely more important than expression of galectin-3 in target
        cells. We conclude that endogenous galectin-3 translocates to VS and promotes
        cell-to-cell viral transfer upon HIV-1 infection.", "venue": "Journal of Immunology",

        Gag p6.", "abstract": "Galectin-3 has been reported to regulate the functions
        of a number of immune cell types. We previously reported that galectin-3 is
        translocated to immunological synapses in T cells upon T-cell receptor engagement,
        where it associates with ALG-2-interacting protein X (Alix). Alix is known
        to coordinate with the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)
        to promote human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 virion release. We hypothesized
        that galectin-3 plays a role in HIV-1 viral budding. Cotransfection of cells
        of the Jurkat T line with galectin-3 and HIV-1 plasmids resulted in increased
        HIV-1 budding, and suppression of galectin-3 expression by RNAi in Hut78 and
        primary CD4+ T cells led to reduced HIV-1 budding. We used immunofluorescence
        microscopy to observe the partial colocalization of galectin-3, Alix and Gag
        in HIV-1-infected cells. Results from co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate
        that galectin-3 expression promotes Alix-Gag p6 association, whereas the results
        of Alix knockdown suggest that galectin-3 promotes HIV-1 budding through Alix.
        HIV-1 particles released from galectin-3-expressing cells acquire the galectin-3
        protein in an Alix-dependent manner, with proteins primarily residing inside
        the virions. We also found that the galectin-3 N-terminal domain interacts
        with the proline-rich region of Alix. Collectively, these results suggest
        that endogenous galectin-3 facilitates HIV-1 budding by promoting the Alix-Gag

        lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma and an aggressive
        malignancy. Galectin-3 (gal-3), the only antiapoptotic member of the galectin
        family, is overexpressed in DLBCL. While gal-3 can localize to intracellular
        sites, gal-3 is secreted by DLBCL cells and binds back to the cell surface
        in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. The major counterreceptor for gal-3 on
        DLBCL cells was identified as the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45.
        Removal of cell-surface gal-3 from CD45 with the polyvalent glycan inhibitor
        GCS-100 rendered DLBCL cells susceptible to chemotherapeutic agents. Binding

        the increased susceptibility of DLBCL cells to chemotherapeutic agents after

        disease progression and demise in a SOD1G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral
        sclerosis", "abstract": "Galectins are pleiotropic carbohydrate\u2010binding
        lectins involved in inflammation, growth/differentiation, and tissue remodeling.
        The functional role of galectins in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is
        unknown. Expression studies revealed increases in galectin\u20101 mRNA and
        protein in spinal cords from SOD1 G93A mice, and in galectin\u20103 and \u20109
        mRNAs and proteins in spinal cords of both SOD1 G93A mice and sporadic ALS
        patients. As the increase in galectin\u20103 appeared in early presymptomatic
        stages and increased progressively through to end stage of disease in the
        mouse, it was selected for additional study, where it was found to be mainly
        expressed by microglia. Galectin\u20103 antagonists are not selective and
        do not readily cross the blood\u2013brain barrier; therefore, we generated
        SOD1 G93A/Gal\u20103 \u2212/\u2212 transgenic mice to evaluate galectin\u20103
        deletion in a widely used mouse model of ALS. Disease progression, neurological
        symptoms, survival, and inflammation were assessed to determine the effect
        of galectin\u20103 deletion on the SOD1 G93A disease phenotype. Galectin\u20103
        deletion did not change disease onset, but resulted in more rapid progression
        through functionally defined disease stages, more severely impaired neurological
        symptoms at all stages of disease, and expiration, on average, 25 days earlier
        than SOD1 G93A/Gal\u20103 +/+ cohorts. In addition, microglial staining, as
        well as TNF\u2010\u03b1, and oxidative injury were increased in SOD1 G93A/Gal\u20103
        \u2212/\u2212 mice compared with SOD1 G93A/Gal\u20103 +/+ cohorts. These data
        support an important functional role for microglial galectin\u20103 in neuroinflammation
        during chronic neurodegenerative disease. We suggest that elevations in galectin\u20103
        by microglia as disease progresses may represent a protective, anti\u2010inflammatory
        innate immune response to chronic motor neuron degeneration.", "venue": "Brain

        synthesizes glycoconjugates which interact with galectin-3, eliciting an intense
        humoral immune response. Moreover, it was demonstrated that galectin-3 regulates
        B cell differentiation into plasma cells. Splenomegaly is a hallmark event
        characterized by polyclonal B cell activation and enhancement of antibody
        production. Here, we investigated whether galectin-3 interferes with spleen
        organization and B cell compartment during chronic schistosomiasis, using
        wild type (WT) and galectin-3-/- mice. In chronically-infected galectin-3-/-
        mice the histological architecture of the spleen, including white and red
        pulps, was disturbed with heterogeneous lymphoid follicles, an increased number
        of plasma cells (CD19-B220-/lowCD138+) and a reduced number of macrophages
        (CD19-B220-Mac-1+CD138-) and B lymphocytes (CD19+B220+/highCD138-), compared
        with the WT infected mice. In the absence of galectin-3 there was an increase
        of annexin-V+PI- cells and a major presence of apoptotic cells in spleen compared
        with WT infected mice. In spleen of WT infected mice galectin-3 was largely
        expressed in lymphoid follicles and extrafollicular sites. Thus, we propose
        that galectin-3 plays a role in splenic architecture, controlling distinct

        plasmacytogenesis in the course of S. mansoni infection.", "venue": "Histology

        are animal lectins that bind to \u03b2\u2010galactosides, such as lactose
        and N\u2010acetyllactosamine, in free form or contained in glycoproteins or
        glycolipids. They are located intracellularly or extracellularly. In the latter
        they exhibit bivalent or multivalent interactions with glycans on cell surfaces
        and induce various cellular responses, including production of cytokines and
        other inflammatory mediators, cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis. Furthermore,
        they can form lattices with membrane glycoprotein receptors and modulate receptor
        properties. Intracellular galectins can participate in signaling pathways
        and alter biological responses, including apoptosis, cell differentiation,
        and cell motility. Current evidence indicates that galectins play important
        roles in acute and chronic inflammatory responses, as well as other diverse
        pathological processes. Galectin involvement in some processes in vivo has
        been discovered, or confirmed, through studies of genetically engineered mouse
        strains, each deficient in a given galectin. Current evidence also suggests
        that galectins may be therapeutic targets or employed as therapeutic agents

        key fibrogenic cells of the liver, transdifferentiate into myofibroblasts
        upon phagocytosis of apoptotic hepatocytes. Galectin-3, a \u03b2-galactoside-binding
        lectin, is a regulator of the phagocytic process. In this study, our aim was
        to study the mechanism by which extracellular galectin-3 modulates HSC phagocytosis
        and activation. The role of galectin-3 in engulfment was evaluated by phagocytosis
        and integrin binding assays in primary HSC. Galectin-3 expression was studied
        by real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and in vivo studies
        were done in wild-type and galectin-3(-/-) mice. We found that HSC from galectin-3(-/-)
        mice displayed decreased phagocytic activity, expression of transforming growth
        factor-\u03b21, and procollagen \u03b11(I). Recombinant galectin-3 reversed
        this defect, suggesting that extracellular galectin-3 is required for HSC
        activation. Galectin-3 facilitated the \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) heterodimer-dependent
        binding, indicating that galectin-3 modulates HSC phagocytosis via cross-linking
        this integrin and enhancing the tethering of apoptotic cells. Blocking integrin
        \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) resulted in decreased phagocytosis. Galectin-3 expression
        and release were induced in active HSC engulfing apoptotic cells, and this
        was mediated by the nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling. The upregulation of
        galectin-3 in active HSC was further confirmed in vivo in bile duct-ligated
        (BDL) rats. Galectin-3(-/-) mice displayed significantly decreased fibrosis,
        with reduced expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and procollagen \u03b11(I)
        following BDL. In summary, extracellular galectin-3 plays a key role in liver
        fibrosis by mediating HSC phagocytosis, activation, and subsequent autocrine

        and Gag-p6 (170.25)", "abstract": "\n Galectin-3 (Gal3), a \u03b2-galactoside-binding
        lectin, has been reported to regulate the functions of a number of immune
        cell types. We demonstrated that Gal3 is translocated to the immunological
        synapse in T cells upon T cell receptors engagement and associated with ALG-2-interacting
        protein X (Alix). Alix is known to coordinate with endosomal sorting complex
        required for transport (ESCRT) to promote HIV-1 virion release through binding
        to the HIV-1 Gag-P6 protein. We hypothesized that Gal3 plays a role in HIV-1
        viral budding. Co-transfection of Gal3 and HIV-1 plasmids in HEK293T cells
        indicate that endogenous Gal3 facilitates HIV-1 budding. This effect was inhibited
        by knocking down Gal3 expression by shRNA. Immunoblotting of trypsin-treated
        virions and immuno-electron microscopy indicate that Gal3 is mainly located
        inside the HIV-1 virions. Immunofluorescent staining and coimmunoprecipitation
        (Co-IP) suggest that Gal3, Alix, and Gag-p6 are colocalized in HIV-1-infected
        cells. Notably, Gal3 expression was found to promote the association between
        Alix and Gag-p6 as demonstrated by Co-IP. Co-transfection of Gal3 and HIV-1
        plasmids in Alix knocked-down cells indicate that promotion of HIV-1 budding
        by Gal3 is mediated through Alix. Finally, knocking down Gal3 expression in
        primary CD4+ T cells resulted in a significant decrease of HIV-1 titer. Our
        results indicate that endogenous Gal3 facilitates the HIV-1 virus budding

        B Cell Niches in the Course of Schistosoma mansoni Infection", "abstract":
        "Galectin-3 is a \u03b2-galactoside-binding protein that has been shown to
        regulate pathophysiological processes, including cellular activation, differentiation
        and apoptosis. Recently, we showed that galectin-3 acts as a potent inhibitor
        of B cell differentiation into plasma cells. Here, we have investigated whether
        galectin-3 interferes with the lymphoid organization of B cell compartments
        in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) during chronic schistosomiasis, using WT
        and galectin-3-/- mice. Schistosoma mansoni synthesizes GalNAc\u03b21-4(Fuc\u03b11-3)GlcNAc(Lac-DiNAc)
        structures (N-acetylgalactosamine \u03b21-4 N-acetylglucosamine), which are
        known to interact with galectin-3 and elicit an intense humoral response.
        Antigens derived from the eggs and adult worms are continuously drained to
        MLNs and induce a polyclonal B cell activation. In the present work, we observed
        that chronically-infected galectin-3-/- mice exhibited a significant reduced
        amount of macrophages and B lymphocytes followed by drastic histological changes
        in B lymphocyte and plasma cell niches in the MLNs. The lack of galectin-3
        favored an increase in the lymphoid follicle number, but made follicular cells
        more susceptible to apoptotic stimuli. There were an excessive quantity of
        apoptotic bodies, higher number of annexin V+/PI- cells, and reduced clearance
        of follicular apoptotic cells in the course of schistosomiasis. Here, we observed
        that galectin-3 was expressed in non-lymphoid follicular cells and its absence
        was associated with severe damage to tissue architecture. Thus, we convey
        new information on the role of galectin-3 in regulation of histological events
        associated with B lymphocyte and plasma cell niches, apoptosis, phagocytosis
        and cell cycle properties in the MLNs of mice challenged with S.mansoni.",

        "The breakdown of triglycerides, or lipolysis, is a tightly controlled process
        that regulates fat mobilization in accord with an animal''s energy needs.
        It is well established that lipolysis is stimulated by hormones that signal
        energy demand and is suppressed by the antilipolytic hormone insulin. However,
        much still remains to be learned about regulation of lipolysis by intracellular
        signaling pathways in adipocytes. Here we show that galectin-12, a member
        of a \u03b2-galactoside\u2013binding lectin family preferentially expressed
        by adipocytes, functions as an intrinsic negative regulator of lipolysis.
        Galectin-12 is primarily localized on lipid droplets and regulates lipolytic
        protein kinase A signaling by acting upstream of phosphodiesterase activity
        to control cAMP levels. Ablation of galectin-12 in mice results in increased
        adipocyte mitochondrial respiration, reduced adiposity, and ameliorated insulin
        resistance/glucose intolerance. This study identifies unique properties of
        this intracellular galectin that is localized to an organelle and performs
        a critical function in lipid metabolism. These findings add to the significant
        functions exhibited by intracellular galectins, and have important therapeutic
        implications for human metabolic disorders.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

        is a critical detrimental event that leads to chronic kidney injury in association
        with renal fibrosis. The present study was designed to investigate the role
        of galectin-3 (Gal-3), an important regulator of multiple apoptotic pathways,
        in chronic kidney disease induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO).
        After UUO, Gal-3 expression significantly increased compared with basal levels
        reaching a peak increase of 95-fold by day 7. Upregulated Gal-3 is predominantly
        tubular at early time points after UUO but shifts to interstitial cells as
        the injury progresses. On day 14, there was a significant increase in TdT-mediated
        dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells (129%) and cytochrome c release (29%),
        and a decrease in BrdU-positive cells (62%) in Gal-3-deficient compared with
        wild-type mice. The degree of renal damage was more extensive in Gal-3-deficient
        mice at days 14 and 21, 35 and 21% increase in total collagen, respectively.
        Despite more severe fibrosis, myofibroblasts were significantly decreased
        by 58% on day 14 in the Gal-3-deficient compared with wild-type mice. There
        was also a corresponding 80% decrease in extracellular matrix synthesis in
        Gal-3-deficient compared with wild-type mice. Endo180 is a recently recognized
        receptor for intracellular collagen degradation that is expressed by interstitial
        cells during renal fibrogenesis. Endo180 expression was significantly decreased
        by greater than 50% in Gal-3-deficient compared with wild-type mice. Taken
        together, these results suggested that Gal-3 not only protects renal tubules
        from chronic injury by limiting apoptosis but that it may lead to enhanced

        Neutrophil Activation", "abstract": "Galectin-3 (Gal 3) is a glycan-binding
        protein that can be secreted by activated macrophages and mast cells at inflammation
        sites and plays an important role in inflammatory diseases caused by Bacteria
        and their products, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Although it is well
        established that Gal 3 can interact with LPS, the pathophysiological importance
        of LPS/Gal 3 interactions is not fully understood. Data presented herein demonstrate
        for the first time that the interaction of Gal 3, either via its carbohydrate
        binding C-terminal domain or via its N-terminal part, with LPS from different
        bacterial strains, enhances the LPS-mediated neutrophil activation in vitro.
        Gal 3 allowed low LPS concentrations (1 \u00b5g/mL without serum, 1 ng/mL
        with serum) to upregulate CD11b expression and reactive oxygen species (ROS)
        generation on human neutrophils in vitro and drastically enhanced the binding
        efficiency of LPS to the neutrophil surface. These effects required LPS preincubation
        with Gal 3, before neutrophil stimulation and involved specific Gal 3/LPS
        interaction. A C-terminal Gal-3 fragment, which retains the lectin domain
        but lacks the N-terminal part, was still able to bind both to Escherichia
        coli LPS and to neutrophils, but had lost the ability to enhance neutrophil
        response to LPS. This result emphasizes the importance of an N-terminus-mediated
        Gal 3 oligomerization induced by its interaction with LPS. Finally we demonstrated
        that Balb/C mice were more susceptible to LPS-mediated shock when LPS was
        pretreated with Gal 3. Altogether, these results suggest that multimeric interactions
        between Gal 3 oligomers and LPS potentiate its pro-inflammatory effects on
        neutrophils.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 57, "citationCount":

        critical role in the initiation and maintenance of inflammatory responses.
        Galectin-3, a protein found in DCs, is a carbohydrate-binding protein implicated
        in several cellular processes. In mouse models of asthma and atopic dermatitis,
        galectin-3-deficient (gal3-/-) mice had significantly fewer infiltrating eosinophils

        suggesting that galectin-3 plays a key role in allergic inflammation. Given
        the ability of DCs to direct the T lymphocyte response, we hypothesized that
        galectin-3 may affect immune responses by altering DC functions and tested
        the hypothesis by comparing wild-type and gal3-/- DCs. OT-II CD4+ cells cultured
        with OVA-pulsed gal3-/- DCs generated higher Th1 responses relative to gal3+/+
        DCs, and the differences were diminished following IL-12 neutralization. Moreover,
        gal3-/- DCs expressed more IL-12p35 mRNA than gal3+/+ DCs, indicating that
        gal3 may modulate IL-12 at the transcriptional level or through upstream signaling
        pathways. T cells co-cultured with gal3-/- DCs also secreted more IL-17 than
        cells cultured with gal3+/+ DCs, suggesting that gal3 may also negatively
        regulate Th17 responses. Furthermore, we observed higher IL-6 secretion and
        IL-23p19 expression in gal3-/- DCs, which may contribute to the enhanced Th17

        is associated with sarcoma progression, invasion and metastasis. Here we determined
        the role of extracellular galectin-3 on migration of sarcoma cells on laminin-111.
        Cell lines from methylcholanthrene-induced sarcomas from both wild type and
        galectin-3\u2212/\u2212 mice were established. Despite the presence of similar
        levels of laminin-binding integrins on the cell surface, galectin-3\u2212/\u2212
        sarcoma cells were more adherent and less migratory than galectin-3+/+ sarcoma
        cells on laminin-111. When galectin-3 was transiently expressed in galectin-3\u2212/\u2212
        sarcoma cells, it inhibited cell adhesion and stimulated the migratory response
        to laminin in a carbohydrate-dependent manner. Extracellular galectin-3 led
        to the recruitment of SHP-2 phosphatase to focal adhesion plaques, followed
        by a decrease in the amount of phosphorylated FAK and phospho-paxillin in
        the lamellipodia of migrating cells. The promigratory activity of extracellular
        galectin-3 was inhibitable by wortmannin, implicating the activation of a
        PI-3 kinase dependent pathway in the galectin-3 triggered disruption of adhesion
        plaques, leading to sarcoma cell migration on laminin-111.", "venue": "PLoS

        toward a Th2-Biased Immunity", "abstract": "There is recent evidence that
        galectin-3 participates in immunity to infections, mostly by tuning cytokine
        production. We studied the balance of Th1/Th2 responses to P. brasiliensis
        experimental infection in the absence of galectin-3. The intermediate resistance
        to the fungal infection presented by C57BL/6 mice, associated with the development
        of a mixed type of immunity, was replaced with susceptibility to infection
        and a Th2-polarized immune response, in galectin-3-deficient (gal3\u2212/\u2212)
        mice. Such a response was associated with defective inflammatory and delayed
        type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions, high IL-4 and GATA-3 expression and
        low nitric oxide production in the organs of infected animals. Gal3\u2212/\u2212
        macrophages exhibited higher TLR2 transcript levels and IL-10 production compared
        to wild-type macrophages after stimulation with P. brasiliensis antigens.
        We hypothesize that, during an in vivo P. brasiliensis infection, galectin-3
        exerts its tuning role on immunity by interfering with the generation of regulatory
        macrophages, thus hindering the consequent Th2-polarized type of response.",

        infection (133.34)", "abstract": "\n Galectin-3 is a \u03b2-galactoside-binding
        animal lectin expressed in various immune cell types including macrophages.
        It has been implicated as a positive regulator of macrophage phagocytosis
        and as a negative regulator of LPS-mediated inflammation. However, its role
        in macrophage antibacterial function has not been fully elucidated. The aim
        of this study was to investigate the role of galectin-3 in macrophage antibacterial
        function against Listeria monocytogenes (LM) infection by studying bone marrow-derived
        macrophages (BMM) from galectin-3-deficient (gal3-/-) and wild-type (gal3+/+)
        mice. After in vitro infection, gal3-/- BMM contained significantly fewer
        viable intracellular bacteria than gal3+/+ BMM. Consistently, immunofluorescent
        staining of infected BMM revealed a significantly lower percentage of cytosolic
        LM escaped from phagosomes in gal3-/- BMM compared to gal3+/+ BMM. Higher
        levels of reactive nitrogen intermediate nitric oxide (NO) but lower levels
        of inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 were detected in LM-infected gal3-/- BMM
        compared to gal3+/+ cells. In addition, we noted elevated levels of NAD(P)H
        in gal3-/- BMM which may contribute to higher amounts of NO in gal3-/- BMM.
        We conclude that galectin-3 plays a regulatory role in macrophage antibacterial
        function by interfering with the production of NO, thereby facilitating the
        survival and replication of intracellular bacteria.", "venue": "Journal of

        belongs to a family of beta-galactoside-binding animal lectins expressed in
        several cell types, including epithelial and immune cells. To establish the
        role of galectin-3 in the development of allergic skin inflammation, we compared
        inflammatory skin responses of galectin-3-deficient (gal3(-/-)) and wild-type
        (gal3(+/+)) mice to epicutaneous sensitization with ovalbumin (OVA). OVA-treated
        gal3(-/-) mice exhibited markedly reduced epidermal thickening, lower eosinophil
        infiltration, and lower serum IgE levels compared with gal3(+/+) mice. The
        former evoked lower interleukin-4, but higher interferon-gamma, mRNA expression
        at OVA-treated skin sites. Moreover, gal3(-/-) splenocytes from OVA-sensitized
        mice secreted more interleukin-12 compared with gal3(+/+) splenocytes. In
        addition, antigen presentation by gal3(-/-) dendritic cells to T cells in
        vitro were T helper cell (Th1)-polarized relative to presentation by gal3(+/+)
        dendritic cells. When exposed to OVA, recipients engrafted with T cells from
        gal3(-/-) OVA-specific T cell receptor transgenic mice developed significantly
        reduced dermatitis and a markedly lower Th2 response compared with recipients
        of comparable gal3(+/+) T cells. We conclude that galectin-3 is critical for
        the development of inflammatory Th2 responses to epicutaneously administered
        antigens; in its absence, mice develop a Th1-polarized response. This regulatory
        effect of galectin-3 on Th development is exerted at both the dendritic cell
        and T cell levels. Our studies suggest that galectin-3 may play an important
        role in the acute phase of human atopic dermatitis.", "venue": "American Journal

        at the immunological synapse", "abstract": "We have investigated the function
        of endogenous galectin-3 in T cells. Galectin-3-deficient (gal3\u2212/\u2212)
        CD4+ T cells secreted more IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 than gal3+/+CD4+ T cells after
        T-cell receptor (TCR) engagement. Galectin-3 was recruited to the cytoplasmic
        side of the immunological synapse (IS) in activated T cells. In T cells stimulated
        on supported lipid bilayers, galectin-3 was primarily located at the peripheral
        supramolecular activation cluster (pSMAC). Gal3+/+ T cells formed central
        SMAC on lipid bilayers less effectively and adhered to antigen-presenting
        cells less firmly than gal3\u2212/\u2212 T cells, suggesting that galectin-3
        destabilizes the IS. Galectin-3 expression was associated with lower levels
        of early signaling events and phosphotyrosine signals at the pSMAC. Additional
        data suggest that galectin-3 potentiates down-regulation of TCR in T cells.
        By yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified as a galectin-3-binding partner,
        Alix, which is known to be involved in protein transport and regulation of
        cell surface expression of certain receptors. Co-immunoprecipitation confirmed
        galectin-3-Alix association and immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated the
        translocation of Alix to the IS in activated T cells. We conclude that galectin-3
        is an inhibitory regulator of T-cell activation and functions intracellularly
        by promoting TCR down-regulation, possibly through modulating Alix''s function

        Galectin\u20103 is absent in resting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells but is inducible
        by various stimuli. These include viral transactivating factors, T\u2010cell
        receptor (TCR) ligation, and calcium ionophores. In addition, galectin\u20103
        is constitutively expressed in human regulatory T cells and CD4+ memory T
        cells. Galectin\u20103 exerts extracellular functions because of its lectin
        activity and recognition of cell surface and extracellular matrix glycans.
        These include cell activation, adhesion, induction of apoptosis, and formation
        of lattices with cell surface glycoprotein receptors. Formation of lattices
        can result in restriction of receptor mobility and cause attenuation of receptor
        functions. Consistent with the presence of galectin\u20103 in intracellular
        locations, several functions have been described for this protein inside T
        cells. These include inhibition of apoptosis, promotion of cell growth, and
        regulation of TCR signal transduction. Studies of cell surface glycosylation
        have led to convergence of glycobiology and galectin biology and provided
        new clues on how galectin\u20103 may participate in the regulation of cell
        surface receptor activities. The rapid expansion of the field of galectin

        (gal3\u2212/\u2212) and their wild\u2010type counterpart (gal3+/+) revealed
        that the LD50 for the gal3\u2212/\u2212 mice was about seven times higher
        than that for the gal3+/+ mice. When challenged with a sublethal dose, gal3\u2212/\u2212
        mice showed lower bacteria counts and higher production of IL\u201012 and
        IFN\u2010\u03b3 production, besides exhibiting a delayed although increased
        inflammatory reaction. Gal3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages exhibited a decreased
        frequency of bacterial replication and survival, and higher transcript levels
        of IL\u20101\u03b2, IL\u20106, IL\u201010, TLR2 and MyD88. R. equi\u2010infected
        gal3+/+ macrophages showed decreased expression of TLR2, whereas R. equi\u2010infected
        gal3\u2212/\u2212 macrophages showed enhanced expression of this receptor.
        Furthermore, galectin\u20103 deficiency in macrophages may be responsible
        for the higher IL\u20101\u03b2 serum levels detected in infected gal3\u2212/\u2212
        mice. Therefore galectin\u20103 may exert a regulatory role in innate immunity
        by diminishing IL\u20101\u03b2 production and thus affecting resistance to
        R. equi infection.", "venue": "European Journal of Immunology", "year": 2008,

        that plays an important role in inflammatory diseases. It also interacts with
        the surface carbohydrates of many pathogens, including LPS. However, its role
        in infection is not fully understood. Data presented herein demonstrate for
        the first time that galectin-3 is a negative regulator of LPS-induced inflammation.
        Galectin-3 is constitutively produced by macrophages and directly binds to
        LPS. Galectin-3-deficient macrophages had markedly elevated LPS-induced signaling
        and inflammatory cytokine production compared with wild-type cells, which
        was specifically inhibited by the addition of recombinant galectin-3 protein.
        In contrast, blocking galectin-3 binding sites by using a neutralizing Ab
        or its ligand, \u03b2-lactose, enhanced LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine
        expression by wild-type macrophages. In vivo, mice lacking galectin-3 were
        more susceptible to LPS shock associated with excessive induction of inflammatory
        cytokines and NO production. However, these changes conferred greater resistance
        to Salmonella infection. Thus, galectin-3 is a previously unrecognized, naturally
        occurring, negative regulator of LPS function, which protects the host from
        endotoxin shock but, conversely, favors Salmonella survival.", "venue": "Journal

        animal lectins and is distinct from other members by the presence of tandem
        repeats in its N-terminal region. Like other members, galectin-3 lacks a classical
        signal sequence, but the protein is secreted by a nonclassical secretary pathway
        and can function extracellularly in an autocrine or paracrine fashion. Galectin-3
        is able to oligomerize and participate in multivalent interactions with cell
        surface and extracellular matrix glycans, through lectin-carbohydrate interactions,
        thus affecting cellular functions. Galectin-3 is detectable in the cytosol
        and nucleus and the intracellular protein may bind to other cytoplasmic and
        nuclear proteins by protein-protein interactions. In this manner, galectin-3
        is able to influence intracellular signaling pathways and exert various functions.
        Galectin-3 is expressed by virtually all immune and inflammatory cell types,
        either constitutively or in a inducible fashion. A large body of work has
        demonstrated the role of galectin-3 in regulation of the functions of these
        cells. The use of galectin-3-deficient mice has provided additional evidence

        matrix interactions. Extracellular gal\u20103 modulates cell migration and
        adhesion in several physiological and pathological processes. Gal\u20103 is
        highly expressed in activated macrophages. Schistosoma mansoni eggs display
        a large amount of gal\u20103 ligands on their surface and elicit a well\u2010characterized,
        macrophage\u2010dependent, granulomatous, inflammatory reaction. Here, we
        have investigated the acute and chronic phases of S. mansoni infection in
        wild\u2010type and gal\u20103\u2212/\u2212 mice. In the absence of gal\u20103,
        chronic\u2010phase granulomas were smaller in diameter, displaying thinner
        collagen fibers with a loose orientation. Schistosoma\u2010infected gal\u20103\u2212/\u2212
        mice had remarkable changes in the monocyte/macrophage, eosinophil, and B
        lymphocyte subpopulations as compared with the infected wild\u2010type mice.
        We observed a reduction of macrophage number, an increase in eosinophil absolute
        number, and a decrease in B lymphocyte subpopulation (B220+/high cells) in
        the periphery during the evolution of the disease in gal\u20103\u2212/\u2212

        We have compared the cytokine responses of gal3\u2212/\u2212 and gal3+/+ CD4+
        T cells upon activation induced by TCR engagement and found that gal3\u2212/\u2212
        CD4+ T cells secreted more IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 compared to gal3+/+ cells. We
        also found that serum levels of IFN\u03b3 were significantly higher in gal3\u2212/\u2212
        than gal3+/+ mice after exposure to Staphylococcus enterotoxin B. In addition,
        gal3\u2212/\u2212 CD4+ T cells exhibited higher levels of tyrosine-phosphorylated
        proteins, as well as enhanced phosphorylation of early signaling molecules,
        including LAT and Zap70, upon anti-CD3 stimulation. These results suggest
        that endogenous galectin-3 suppresses T cell responses. Immunofluorescence
        analysis revealed that galectin-3 was recruited to the immunological synapse
        in CD4+ T cells after TCR engagement. Our preliminary data suggest that galectin-3
        expression in T cells correlates with an enhanced down-regulation of TCR when
        the cells are activated by engagement of the receptor, in a manner similar
        to that described for other intracellular proteins that negatively regulate
        T cell activation. We conclude that galectin-3 is an inhibitory regulator

        by recruitment to the immunological synapse following activation by TCR engagement.",

        Blood-Retinal Barrier Dysfunction during Short-Term Diabetes", "abstract":
        "Breakdown of the inner blood-retinal barrier (iBRB) occurs early in diabetes
        and is central to the development of sight-threatening diabetic macular edema
        (DME) as retinopathy progresses. In the current study, we examined how advanced
        glycation end products (AGEs) forming early in diabetes could modulate vasopermeability
        factor expression in the diabetic retina and alter inter-endothelial cell
        tight junction (TJ) integrity leading to iBRB dysfunction. We also investigated
        the potential for an AGE inhibitor to prevent this acute pathology and examined
        a role of the AGE-binding protein galectin-3 (Gal-3) in AGE-mediated cell
        retinal pathophysiology. Diabetes was induced in C57/BL6 wild-type (WT) mice
        and in Gal-3\u2212/\u2212 transgenic mice. Blood glucose was monitored and
        AGE levels were quantified by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The diabetic
        groups were subdivided, and one group was treated with the AGE-inhibitor pyridoxamine
        (PM) while separate groups of WT and Gal-3\u2212/\u2212 mice were maintained
        as nondiabetic controls. iBRB integrity was assessed by Evans blue assay alongside
        visualisation of TJ protein complexes via occludin-1 immunolocalization in
        retinal flat mounts. Retinal expression levels of the vasopermeability factor
        VEGF were quantified using real-time RT-PCR and ELISA. WT diabetic mice showed
        significant AGE -immunoreactivity in the retinal microvasculature and also
        showed significant iBRB breakdown (P < .005). These diabetics had higher VEGF
        mRNA and protein expression in comparison to controls (P < .01). PM-treated
        diabetics had normal iBRB function and significantly reduced diabetes-mediated
        VEGF expression. Diabetic retinal vessels showed disrupted TJ integrity when
        compared to controls, while PM-treated diabetics demonstrated near-normal
        configuration. Gal-3\u2212/\u2212 mice showed significantly less diabetes-mediated
        iBRB dysfunction, junctional disruption, and VEGF expression changes than
        their WT counterparts. The data suggests an AGE-mediated disruption of iBRB
        via upregulation of VEGF in the diabetic retina, possibly modulating disruption
        of TJ integrity, even after acute diabetes. Prevention of AGE formation or
        genetic deletion of Gal-3 can effectively prevent these acute diabetic retinopathy
        changes.", "venue": "International Journal of Experimental Diabetes Research",

        the susceptibility to multiple low dose induced diabetes (MLD-STZ) in galectin
        (gal-3) deficient C57BL/6 mice. Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 and gal-3+/+ mice were
        treated with 5 daily injections of 40 mg/kg STZ and diabetes development evaluated
        by glycemia and immunohistochemistry of the pancreas. Gal-3+/+ mice developed
        delayed sustained and progressive hyperglucemia and mononuclear cell infiltrates

        the role of galectin-3 in the function of mast cells, we studied bone marrow-derived
        mast cells (BMMC) from wild-type (gal3(+/+)) and galectin-3-deficient (gal3(-/-))
        mice. Cells from the two genotypes showed comparable expression of IgE receptor

        BMMC secreted a significantly lower amount of histamine as well as the cytokine
        IL-4, compared with gal3(+/+) BMMC. In addition, we found significantly reduced
        passive cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions in gal3(-/-) mice compared with gal3(+/+)
        mice. These results indicate that there is a defect in the response of mast
        cells in gal3(-/-) mice. Unexpectedly, we found that gal3(-/-) BMMC contained
        a dramatically lower basal level of JNK1 protein compared with gal3(+/+) BMMC,
        which is probably responsible for the lower IL-4 production. The decreased
        JNK1 level in gal3(-/-) BMMC is accompanied by a lower JNK1 mRNA level, suggesting
        that galectin-3 regulates the transcription of the JNK gene or processing
        of its RNA. All together, these results point to an important role of galectin-3
        in mast cell biology.", "venue": "Journal of Immunology", "year": 2006, "referenceCount":

        "In attempts to investigate the role of galectin-3 in innate immunity, we
        studied galectin-3-deficient (gal3-/-) mice with regard to their response
        to Toxoplasma gondii infection, which is characterized by inflammation in
        affected organs, Th-1-polarized immune response, and accumulation of cysts
        in the central nervous system. In wild-type (gal3+/+) mice, infected orally,
        galectin-3 was highly expressed in the leukocytes infiltrating the intestines,
        liver, lungs, and brain. Compared with gal3+/+, infected gal3-/- mice developed
        reduced inflammatory response in all of these organs but the lungs. Brain
        of gal3-/- mice displayed a significantly reduced number of infiltrating monocytes/macrophages
        and CD8+ cells and a higher parasite burden. Furthermore, gal3-/- mice mounted
        a higher Th1-polarized response and had comparable survival rates on peroral
        T. gondii infection, even though they were more susceptible to intraperitoneal
        infection. Interestingly, splenic cells and purified CD11c+ dendritic cells
        from gal3-/- mice produced higher amounts of interleukin-12 than cells from
        gal3+/+ mice, possibly explaining the higher Th1 response verified in the
        gal3-/- mice. We conclude that galectin-3 exerts an important role in innate
        immunity, including not only a pro-inflammatory effect but also a regulatory
        role on dendritic cells, capable of interfering in the adaptive immune response.",

        1 Diabetes", "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002 Macrophages are potent immune regulators
        and are critical in the development and pathogenesis of autoimmune diabetes.
        They are said to be the first cell type to infiltrate the pancreatic islet,
        serve as antigen\u2010presenting cells, and are important as effector cells
        during diabetogenesis. The article examines the role of macrophages in autoimmune
        diabetes with particular emphasis on the role of galectin\u20103, a \u03b2\u2010galactoside\u2010binding
        lectin, and T1/ST2, an IL\u20101 receptor\u2010like protein, both of which
        play significant roles in the immunomodulatory functions of macrophages. Multiple
        low\u2010dose streptozotocin (MLD\u2010STZ) induces infiltration of mononuclear
        cells in the islets of susceptible strains leading to insulitis. Deletion
        of the galectin\u20103 gene from C57BL/6 mice significantly attenuates this
        effect as evaluated by quantitative histology of mononuclear cells and loss
        of insulin\u2010producing \u03b2 cells. In contrast, deletion of the ST2 gene
        enhanced insulitis after MLD\u2010STZ treatment when compared with relatively
        resistant wild\u2010type BALB/c mice. Thus, it appears that functional capacity
        of macrophages influences their participation in T helper (Th) 1\u2010mediated
        autoimmunity and the development of autoimmune diabetogenesis.", "venue":

        Receptors to Induce T Cell Death1", "abstract": "Galectins are a family of
        mammalian \u03b2-galactoside-binding proteins that positively and negatively
        regulate T cell death. Extracellular galectin-1 directly induces death of
        T cells and thymocytes, while intracellular galectin-3 blocks T cell death.
        In contrast to the antiapoptotic function of intracellular galectin-3, we
        demonstrate that extracellular galectin-3 directly induces death of human
        thymocytes and T cells. However, events in galectin-3- and galectin-1-induced
        cell death differ in a number of ways. Thymocyte subsets demonstrate different
        susceptibility to the two galectins: whereas galectin-1 kills double-negative
        and double-positive human thymocytes with equal efficiency, galectin-3 preferentially
        kills double-negative thymocytes. Galectin-3 binds to a complement of T cell
        surface glycoprotein receptors distinct from that recognized by galectin-1.
        Of these glycoprotein receptors, CD45 and CD71, but not CD29 and CD43, appear
        to be involved in galectin-3-induced T cell death. In addition, CD7 that is
        required for galectin-1-induced death is not required for death triggered
        by galectin-3. Following galectin-3 binding, CD45 remains uniformly distributed
        on the cell surface, in contrast to the CD45 clustering induced by galectin-1.
        Thus, extracellular galectin-3 and galectin-1 induce death of T cells through
        distinct cell surface events. However, as galectin-3 and galectin-1 cell death
        are neither additive nor synergistic, the two death pathways may converge
        inside the cell.", "venue": "Journal of Immunology", "year": 2006, "referenceCount":

        host protection against infection. The galectin family of lectins recognizes
        saccharide ligands on a variety of microbial pathogens, including viruses,
        bacteria, and parasites. Galectin-3, a galectin expressed by macrophages,
        dendritic cells, and epithelial cells, binds bacterial and parasitic pathogens
        including Leishmania major, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
        However, there have been no reports of galectins having direct effects on
        microbial viability. We found that galectin-3 bound only to Candida albicans
        species that bear \u03b2-1,2-linked oligomannans on the cell surface, but
        did not bind Saccharomyces cerevisiae that lacks \u03b2-1,2-linked oligomannans.
        Surprisingly, binding directly induced death of Candida species containing
        specific \u03b2-1,2-linked oligomannosides. Thus, galectin-3 can act as a

        end products and galectin-3.", "abstract": "Suppression of angiogenesis during
        diabetes is a recognized phenomenon but is less appreciated within the context
        of diabetic retinopathy. The current study has investigated regulation of
        retinal angiogenesis by diabetic serum and determined if advanced glycation
        end products (AGEs) could modulate this response, possibly via AGE-receptor
        interactions. A novel in vitro model of retinal angiogenesis was developed
        and the ability of diabetic sera to regulate this process was quantified.
        AGE-modified serum albumin was prepared according to a range of protocols,
        and these were also analyzed along with neutralization of the AGE receptors
        galectin-3 and RAGE. Retinal ischemia and neovascularization were also studied
        in a murine model of oxygen-induced proliferative retinopathy (OIR) in wild-type
        and galectin-3 knockout mice (gal3(-/-)) after perfusion of preformed AGEs.
        Serum from nondiabetic patients showed significantly more angiogenic potential
        than diabetic serum (P < 0.0001) and within the diabetic group, poor glycemic
        control resulted in more AGEs but less angiogenic potential than tight control
        (P < 0.01). AGE-modified albumin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of angiogenesis
        (P < 0.001), and AGE receptor neutralization significantly reversed the AGE-mediated
        suppression of angiogenesis (P < 0.01). AGE-treated wild-type mice showed
        a significant increase in inner retinal ischemia and a reduction in neovascularization
        compared with non-AGE controls (P < 0.001). However, ablation of galectin-3
        abolished the AGE-mediated increase in retinal ischemia and restored the neovascular
        response to that seen in controls. The data suggest a significant suppression
        of angiogenesis by the retinal microvasculature during diabetes and implicate
        AGEs and AGE-receptor interactions in its causation.", "venue": "Diabetes",

        family is phylogenically conserved in metazoans, presently consisting of 14
        identified members in mammals, and galectin-3 is one of the most abundant,
        widely distributed, and well-studied members. It is present intracellularly
        in nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, but is also secreted through an unconventional
        mechanism that involves vesicles and exosomes and, consequently, present outside
        the cell. While galectin-3 shares many features with other galectins, including
        cellular compartmentalization and functions, it appears to be unique in its
        structural constituency in the N-terminal domain, which is rich in proline,
        glycine, and alanine. It is through this domain that galectin-3 is able to
        form oligomers, and this may be one feature that functionally differentiates
        it from other galectins. Galectin-3 has been associated with several intracellular
        and extracellular functions, and recent investigations have uncovered proteins
        through which this lectin mediates its activities. The availability of targeted
        mutant mice deficient in galectin- 3 and other proteins has also contributed
        to our appreciation of the breadth of processes in which this protein is involved.
        Among cell functions attributable to galectin-3 are some that are associated
        with neoplastic transformation and invasiveness, but the most extensively
        documented ones are those related to the immune and inflammatory responses.",

        "abstract": "Galectin-12 is a member of the galectin family consisting of
        \u03b2-galactoside-binding proteins with conserved carbohydrate recognition
        domains. This protein is preferentially expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes
        and adipocytes. We previously showed that galectin-12 is induced by cell cycle
        block at the G1 phase and causes G1 arrest when overexpressed (Yang, R.-Y.,
        Hsu, D. K., Yu, L., Ni, J., and Liu, F.-T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20252-20260).
        Here, we show that the galectin-12 gene is expressed in mouse preadipocytes
        and is up-regulated when preadipocytes undergo cell cycle arrest, concomitant
        with acquisition of the competence to undergo differentiation in response
        to adipogenic hormone stimulation. Following a brief down-regulation 1 day
        after adipogenic treatment, its expression was once again markedly elevated
        when cells underwent terminal differentiation. Down-regulation of endogenous
        galectin-12 expression by RNA interference greatly reduced the expression
        of the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-\u03b2
        and -\u03b1 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 and severely
        suppressed adipocyte differentiation as a result of defective adipogenic signaling.
        We conclude that galectin-12 is required for signal transduction that conveys
        hormone stimulation to the induction of adipogenic factors essential for adipocyte
        differentiation. The findings suggest that galectin-12 is a major regulator
        of adipose tissue development.", "venue": "Journal of Biological Chemistry",

        "Galectin-3 is a member of a large family of animal lectins. This protein
        is expressed abundantly by macrophages, but its function in this cell type
        is not well understood. We have studied the effect of galectin-3 gene targeting
        on phagocytosis, a major function of macrophages. Compared with wild-type
        macrophages, galectin-3-deficient (gal3-/-) cells exhibited reduced phagocytosis
        of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes and apoptotic thymocytes in vitro. In addition,
        gal3-/- mice showed attenuated phagocytic clearance of apoptotic thymocytes
        by peritoneal macrophages in vivo. These mice also exhibited reduced IgG-mediated
        phagocytosis of erythrocytes by Kupffer cells in a murine model of autoimmune
        hemolytic anemia. Additional experiments indicate that extracellular galectin-3
        does not contribute appreciably to the phagocytosis-promoting function of
        this protein. Confocal microscopic analysis of macrophages containing phagocytosed
        erythrocytes revealed localization of galectin-3 in phagocytic cups and phagosomes.
        Furthermore, gal3-/- macrophages exhibited a lower degree of actin rearrangement
        upon Fcgamma receptor crosslinkage. These results indicate that galectin-3
        contributes to macrophage phagocytosis through an intracellular mechanism.
        Thus, galectin-3 may play an important role in both innate and adaptive immunity
        by contributing to phagocytic clearance of microorganisms and apoptotic cells.",

        or delayed re-epithelialization are a serious medical problem. These conditions
        affect many tissues, are painful, and are difficult to treat. In this study,
        using cornea as a model, we demonstrate for the first time the importance
        of carbohydrate-binding proteins galectins-3 and -7 in re-epithelialization
        of wounds. In two different models of corneal wound healing, re-epithelialization
        of wounds was significantly slower in galectin-3-deficient (gal3\u2212/\u2212)
        mice compared with wild-type (gal3+/+) mice. In contrast, there was no difference
        in corneal epithelial wound closure rates between galectin-1-deficient and
        wild-type mice. Quantitation of the bromodeoxyuridine-labeled cells in gal3+/+
        and gal3\u2212/\u2212 corneas revealed that corneal epithelial cell proliferation
        rate is not perturbed in gal3\u2212/\u2212 corneas. Exogenous galectin-3 accelerated
        re-epithelialization of wounds in gal3+/+ mice but, surprisingly, not in the
        gal3\u2212/\u2212 mice. Gene expression analysis using cDNA microarrays revealed
        that healing corneas of gal3\u2212/\u2212 mice contain markedly reduced levels
        of galectin-7 compared with those of gal3+/+ mice. More importantly, unlike
        galectin-3, galectin-7 accelerated re-epithelialization of wounds in both
        gal3\u2212/\u2212 and gal3+/+ mice. In corresponding experiments, recombinant
        galectin-1 did not stimulate the corneal epithelial wound closure rate. The
        extent of acceleration of re-epithelialization of wounds with both galectin-3
        and galectin-7 was greater than that observed in most of the published studies
        using growth factors. These findings have broad implications for developing

        To identify these potential factors, mAbs were generated to a membrane preparation

        A mAb recognizing a 32\u201335 kDa macrophage protein associated with the

        expressed in all types of stratified epithelia, but is significantly down-regulated
        in squamous cell carcinomas. This protein was recently found to be highly
        inducible by p53 in a colon carcinoma cell line, DLD-1, and designated as
        PIG1 (for p53-inducedgene 1). We studied transfectants of HeLa and DLD-1 cells
        ectopically expressing this protein and found that they were more susceptible
        to apoptosis than control transfectants. This was observed in apoptosis induced
        by mechanistically distinct stimuli, suggesting that galectin-7 acts on a
        common point in the apoptosis signaling pathways. Further analyses of actinomycin
        D-induced apoptosis demonstrated that galectin-7 expression causes enhanced
        caspase-3 activity and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and the potentiation
        of apoptosis by galectin-7 was completely abrogated by a caspase inhibitor,
        benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone. In addition, galectin-7
        transfectants displayed accelerated mitochondrial cytochrome c release and
        up-regulated JNK activity upon apoptosis induction. Several lines of evidence
        indicate that the effect on apoptosis is not due to the lectin functioning
        extracellularly through interactions with cell surface glycoconjugates. In
        fact, this lectin is found to localize in nuclei and cytoplasm of the transfectants
        and the transformed keratinocyte line HaCaT. Therefore, galectin-7 is a pro-apoptotic
        protein that functions intracellularly upstream of JNK activation and cytochrome
        c release. DNA microarray analysis revealed genes that are differentially
        expressed between galectin-7 and control transfectants. Some of them are potentially
        contributory to this lectin''s proapoptotic function and these include redox-related

        and growth\u2010regulating properties, as an AGE receptor and its contribution

        wild\u2010type mice were rendered diabetic with streptozotocin and killed
        4 months later, together with age\u2010matched nondiabetic controls. Despite
        a comparable degree of metabolic derangement, galectin\u20103\u2010deficient

        with a more marked renal/glomerular AGE accumulation, indicating it was attributable

        animal lectins with conserved carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs). Here
        we report the identification and characterization of a new galectin, galectin-12,
        which contains two domains that are homologous to the galectin CRD. The N-terminal
        domain contains all of the sequence elements predicted to form the two \u03b2-sheets
        found in other galectins, as well as conserved carbohydrate-interacting residues.
        The C-terminal domain shows considerable divergence from the consensus sequence,
        and many of these conserved residues are not present. Nevertheless, the protein
        has lactose binding activity, most likely due to the contribution of the N-terminal
        domain. The mRNA for galectin-12 contains features coding for proteins with
        growth-regulatory functions. These include start codons in a context that
        are suboptimal for translation initiation and AU-rich motifs in the 3\u2032-untranslated
        region, which are known to confer instability to mRNA. Galectin-12 mRNA is

        "abstract": "Galectin-3 is a \u03b2-galactoside-binding protein implicated
        in diverse biological processes. We found that galectin-3 induced human monocyte
        migration in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, and it was chemotactic at high
        concentrations (1.0 \u03bcM) but chemokinetic at low concentrations (10\u2013100
        nM). Galectin-3-induced monocyte migration was inhibited by its specific mAb
        and was blocked by lactose and a C-terminal domain fragment of the protein,
        indicating that both the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of galectin-3 are
        involved in this activity. Pertussis toxin (PTX) almost completely blocked
        monocyte migration induced by high concentrations of galectin-3. Galectin-3
        caused a Ca2+ influx in monocytes at high, but not low, concentrations, and
        both lactose and PTX inhibited this response. There was no cross-desensitization
        between galectin-3 and any of the monocyte-reactive chemokines examined, including
        monocyte chemotactic protein-1, macrophage inflammatory protein-1\u03b1, and
        stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1. Cultured human macrophages and alveolar
        macrophages also migrated toward galectin-3, but not monocyte chemotactic
        protein-1. Finally, galectin-3 was found to cause monocyte accumulation in
        vivo in mouse air pouches. These results indicate that galectin-3 is a novel
        chemoattractant for monocytes and macrophages and suggest that the effect
        is mediated at least in part through a PTX-sensitive (G protein-coupled) pathway.",

        carcinoma", "abstract": "Galectins are a family of \u03b2\u2010galactoside\u2010binding
        animal lectins. In particular, a widely studied member galectin\u20103, previously
        designated as \u03f5BP, CBP35, Mac\u20102, L\u201029 and L\u201034, has been
        associated with assorted processes such as cell growth, tumor transformation
        and metastasis. Galectin\u20103 is expressed in various tissues and organs
        but is significantly absent in normal hepatocytes. However, evaluation of
        patient liver biopsies for galectin\u20103 expression resulted in the finding
        that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) frequently expressed significant levels
        of this lectin (76% immunohistochemically positive). Further investigation
        revealed that galectin\u20103 expression in HCC is independent of whether
        the patient had prior hepatitis B virus infection: 14 of 18 HCC cases from
        HBV+ patients, and 5 of 7 cases from HBV\u2212 patients demonstrated positive
        galectin\u20103 immunohistochemistry. However, co\u2010transfection studies
        using a galectin\u20103 promoter construct and an HBV\u2010X protein (HBV\u2010X)
        expression vector demonstrated that galectin\u20103 expression can occur through
        transactivation of the lectin promoter by HBV\u2010X. Based on presently known
        properties of this lectin, it is possible that deregulated expression of galectin\u20103
        can result in tumor transformation and invasiveness, or confer propensity
        for tumor cell survival. In addition, galectin\u20103 was abundantly expressed
        in cirrhotic liver in peripheral distribution within regenerating nodules.
        Such galectin\u20103 expression in rapidly proliferating hepatocytes in cirrhotic
        liver may be a result of the high mitotic index. Alternatively, it is possible
        that proliferating cells expressing galectin\u20103 are in the process of
        being transformed, thus indicating an early neoplastic event. Int. J. Cancer

        of galectin-3.", "abstract": "Galectin-3 is a member of a large family of
        beta-galactoside-binding animal lectins and is composed of a carboxyl-terminal
        lectin domain connected to an amino-terminal nonlectin part. Previous experimental
        results suggest that, when bound to multivalent glycoconjugates, galectin-3
        self-associates through intermolecular interactions involving the amino-terminal
        domain. In this study, we obtained evidence suggesting that the protein self-associates
        in the absence of its saccharide ligands, in a manner that is dependent on
        the carboxyl-terminal domain. This mode of self-association is inhibitable
        by the lectin''s saccharide ligands. Specifically, recombinant human galectin-3
        was found to bind to galectin-3C (the carboxyl-terminal domain fragment) conjugated
        to Sepharose 4B and the binding was inhibitable by lactose. In addition, biotinylated
        galectin-3 bound to galectin-3 immobilized on plastic surfaces and the binding
        could also be inhibited by various saccharide ligands of the lectin. A mutant
        with a tryptophan to leucine replacement in the carboxyl-terminal domain,
        which exhibited diminished carbohydrate-binding activity, did not bind to
        galectin-3C-Sepharose 4B. Furthermore, galectin-3C formed covalent homodimers
        when it was treated with a chemical cross-linker and the dimer formation was
        completely inhibited by lactose. Therefore, galectin-3 can self-associate
        through intermolecular interactions involving both the amino- and the carboxyl-terminal
        domains and the relative contribution of each depends on whether the lectin
        is bound to its saccharide ligands.", "venue": "Biochemistry", "year": 1998,

        in proliferating cells, suggesting a possible role for this lectin in regulation
        of cell growth. Previously, we have shown that T cells infected with human
        T-cell leukemia virus type I express high levels of galectin-3, in contrast
        to uninfected cells, which do not express detectable amounts of this protein.
        In this study, we examined growth properties of human leukemia T cells transfected
        with galectin-3 cDNA, and thus constitutively overexpressing this lectin.
        Transfectants expressing galectin-3 displayed higher growth rates than control
        transfectants, which do not express this lectin. Furthermore, galectin-3 expression
        in these cells confers resistance to apoptosis induced by anti-Fas antibody
        and staurosporine. Galectin-3 was found to have significant sequence similarity
        with Bcl-2, a well-characterized suppressor of apoptosis. In particular, the
        lectin contains the NWGR motif that is highly conserved among members of the
        Bcl-2 family and shown to be critical for the apoptosis-suppressing activity.
        We further demonstrated that galectin-3 interacts with Bc1-2 in a lactose-inhibitable

        expression of the beta-galactoside-binding lectin, galectin-3.", "abstract":
        "Animal lectins play important roles in a variety of biological processes
        via their recognition of glycoconjugates. Galectin-3 is a beta-galactoside-binding
        lectin previously designated as epsilon BP (IgE-binding protein), CBP35, Mac-2,
        L-29, and L-34, and its expression has been associated with various physiological
        and pathological processes, including cell growth, tumor transformation, and
        metastasis. Galectin-3 is widely distributed in various tissues and cell types
        and is expressed in many leukocytes, with the notable exception of B and T
        lymphocytes. We now report that galectin-3 is abundantly expressed in a number
        of human T lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I-infected human T cell lines, including
        F6T, HUT 102, K3T, MT-2, and SLB-I, but is not expressed in non-HTLV-I-infected
        T cell lines such as Jurkat, CEM, and MOLT-4. In addition, the galectin-3
        level was markedly increased in human thymocytes after infection with HTLV-I
        as compared with uninfected thymocytes. The up-regulation of galectin-3 expression
        appeared to correlate well with HTLV-I gene expression, as undetectable or
        very low levels of galectin-3 were found in the S1T and ATL-1K cell lines,
        which are nonproductively infected with HTLV-I. In co-transfection experiments,
        the galectin-3 promoter was significantly up-regulated by expression vectors
        encoding the 40-kd Tax protein, a potent transactivator in HTLV-I. Analysis
        of various Tax mutants suggested that galectin-3 promoter induction is dependent
        on activation of the cyclic-AMP-responsive element binding protein/activation
        transcription factor family of transcription factors and, to a lesser extent,
        nuclear factor-kappa B/Rel induction. Transfection of human promonocytic U-937
        cells with an HTLV-I Tax expression vector induced galectin-3 expression in
        this cell line. Functionally, galectin-3 was shown to activate interleukin-2
        production in Jurkat T cells. Together, these findings raise the possibility
        that HTLV-I Tax production induces the transcription and subsequent synthesis
        and secretion of galectin-3, which in turn may further activate these T cells
        and contribute to the altered properties of cell growth found in adult T cell
        leukemia induced by HTLV-I.", "venue": "American Journal of Pathology", "year":

        a member of a newly defined family of animal lectins, which is composed of
        three domains: a small amino-terminal domain, a domain containing repeating
        elements, and a carboxyl-terminal domain containing the carbohydrate-recognition
        site. Various functions have been described or proposed for this lectin, and
        it appears that galectin-3 has diverse roles. Murine monoclonal antibodies
        (MAbs) have been generated from mice hyperimmunized with recombinant human
        galectin-3 or galectin-3C (the carboxyl-terminal domain), and seven MAbs have
        been characterized in detail. All MAbs generated against the intact galectin-3
        recognize the amino-terminal region of the molecule, as demonstrated by ELISA
        and immunoblotting using recombinant galectin-3C and galectin-3NR, which contains
        the amino-terminal domain and all the repeating elements. Their epitopes were
        all found to be within the first 45 amino acids of galectin-3, as determined
        by using galectin-3 mutants with a truncated amino-terminal region. However,
        these MAbs were found to profoundly modulate the lectin activities of galectin-3.
        The MAb B2C10 inhibited (i) the binding of 125I-labeled galectin-3 to IgE
        coated on microtiter plates; (ii) the galectin-3''s hemagglutination activity;
        and (iii) galectin-3-induced superoxide production by human neutrophils. Other
        MAbs, especially A3A12, caused marked potentiation of these activities. The
        results support our model that the lectin function of galectin-3 is influenced
        by protein homodimerization resulting from self-association of the amino-terminal
        region of the molecule. The potentiating activities of some MAbs are probably
        due to facilitation of dimerization galectin-3, and the inhibitory activity
        of MAb B2C10 is probably the result of its disruption of the self-association
        process.", "venue": "Biochemistry", "year": 1996, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        animal lectins has recently been designated as galectins. One member of this
        family, galectin-3, has been known as epsilon BP for its IgE-binding activity
        and as Mac-2, a macrophage surface antigen, CBP35, CBP30, L-29, and L-34.
        Although much information has accumulated on the expression of this lectin
        in murine macrophages and human monocytic cell lines, little is known about
        the expression and function of this protein in normal human monocytes/macrophages.
        We now report that galectin-3 is expressed in normal human peripheral blood
        monocytes and its level increases dramatically as human monocytes differentiate
        into macrophages upon culturing in vitro. Immunoblot analysis showed that
        there was a 5-fold increase in the level of galectin-3 after 1 day of culture
        and greater than a 12-fold increase after 5 days. Immunocytochemical analysis
        confirmed this progressive increase of galectin-3 expression in cultured monocytes.
        Immunogold cytochemistry/electron microscopy analysis revealed that galectin-3
        was expressed on the surface of human monocytes and that the level of cell
        surface galectin-3 increased progressively as these cells differentiated into
        macrophages. The level of galectin-3 in human monocytes/macrophages was modulated
        by stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma, and galectin-3
        was secreted when monocytes were stimulated by calcium ionophore A23187 Soluble
        galectin-3 caused superoxide release from human monocytes; this activity was
        dependent on the lectin property of galectin-3, as it was inhibitable by lactose.
        Thus, galectin-3 may modulate the function of this cell type in an autocrine
        or paracrine fashion through binding to cell surface glycoconjugates.", "venue":

        M(r) protein originally identified in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) cells.
        The protein is composed of two domains with the amino-terminal domain containing
        a highly conserved repetitive sequence and the carboxyl-terminal domain containing
        consensus sequences shared by other beta-galactoside-binding soluble lectins.
        The protein has wide tissue distribution, is found on cell surfaces and in
        extracellular milieu. By combined efforts from several research groups including
        ours a multifunctional nature of this lectin began to emerge. This review
        emphasizes the following characteristics of epsilon BP: (i) epsilon BP is
        secreted by cells such as macrophages; (ii) like many other lectins, epsilon
        BP functions at least bivalently; (iii) epsilon BP has specificity for distinct
        oligosaccharide structures that have a terminal galactose not masked by sialic
        acids; and (iv) in addition to binding IgE, epsilon BP binds to surfaces of
        various cell types via lectin-carbohydrate interaction. Importantly, epsilon
        BP binds to the IgE receptor on mast cells. We propose that epsilon BP can
        function as a modulatory protein on various cells by cross-linking critical
        cell surface glycoproteins. The proposed action of epsilon BP on mast cells
        is presented as a model.", "venue": "Immunopharmacology", "year": 1993, "referenceCount":

        "The COVID-19 pandemic has implications beyond physical health, affecting
        society and economies. Government efforts to slow down the spread of the virus
        have had a severe impact on many businesses, including restaurants. Mandatory
        policies such as restaurant closures, bans on social gatherings, and social
        distancing restrictions have affected restaurant operations as well as customer
        preferences (e.g., prompting a demand of stricter hygiene standards). As of
        now, however, it is not clear how and to what extent the pandemic has affected
        restaurant reviews, an analysis of which could potentially inform policies
        for addressing this ongoing situation. In this work, we present our efforts
        to understand the effects of COVID-19 on restaurant reviews, with a focus
        on Yelp reviews produced during the pandemic for New York City and Los Angeles
        County restaurants. Overall, we make the following contributions. First, we
        assemble a dataset of 600 reviews with manual annotations of fine-grained
        COVID-19 aspects related to restaurants (e.g., hygiene practices, service
        changes, sympathy and support for local businesses). Second, we address COVID-19
        aspect detection using supervised classifiers, weakly-supervised approaches
        based on keywords, and unsupervised topic modeling approaches, and experimentally
        show that classifiers based on pre-trained BERT representations achieve the
        best performance (F1=0.79). Third, we analyze the number and evolution of
        COVID-related aspects over time and show that the resulting time series have
        substantial correlation (Spearman\u2019s \\rho=0.84) with critical statistics
        related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the number of new COVID-19 cases.
        To our knowledge, this is the first work analyzing the effects of COVID-19
        on Yelp restaurant reviews and could potentially inform policies by public
        health departments, for example, to cover resource utilization.", "venue":

        "title": "Bayesian decision-making under misspecified priors with applications
        to meta-learning", "abstract": "Thompson sampling and other Bayesian sequential
        decision-making algorithms are among the most popular approaches to tackle
        explore/exploit trade-offs in (contextual) bandits. The choice of prior in
        these algorithms offers flexibility to encode domain knowledge but can also
        lead to poor performance when misspecified. In this paper, we demonstrate
        that performance degrades gracefully with misspecification. We prove that
        the expected reward accrued by Thompson sampling (TS) with a misspecified
        prior differs by at most \u00d5(H ) from TS with a well specified prior, where
        is the total-variation distance between priors and H is the learning horizon.
        Our bound does not require the prior to have any parametric form. For priors
        with bounded support, our bound is independent of the cardinality or structure
        of the action space, and we show that it is tight up to universal constants
        in the worst case. Building on our sensitivity analysis, we establish generic
        PAC guarantees for algorithms in the recently studied Bayesian meta-learning
        setting and derive corollaries for various families of priors. Our results
        generalize along two axes: (1) they apply to a broader family of Bayesian
        decision-making algorithms, including a Monte-Carlo implementation of the
        knowledge gradient algorithm (KG), and (2) they apply to Bayesian POMDPs,
        the most general Bayesian decision-making setting, encompassing contextual
        bandits as a special case. Through numerical simulations, we illustrate how
        prior misspecification and the deployment of one-step look-ahead (as in KG)
        can impact the convergence of meta-learning in multi-armed and contextual
        bandits with structured and correlated priors.", "venue": "Neural Information

        English Annotations Only", "abstract": "Health departments have been deploying
        text classification systems for the early detection of foodborne illness complaints
        in social media documents such as Yelp restaurant reviews. Current systems
        have been successfully applied for documents in English and, as a result,
        a promising direction is to increase coverage and recall by considering documents
        in additional languages, such as Spanish or Chinese. Training previous systems
        for more languages, however, would be expensive, as it would require the manual
        annotation of many documents for each new target language. To address this
        challenge, we consider cross-lingual learning and train multilingual classifiers
        using only the annotations for English-language reviews. Recent zero-shot
        approaches based on pre-trained multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) have been shown
        to effectively align languages for aspects such as sentiment. Interestingly,
        we show that those approaches are less effective for capturing the nuances
        of foodborne illness, our public health application of interest. To improve
        performance without extra annotations, we create artificial training documents
        in the target language through machine translation and train mBERT jointly
        for the source (English) and target language. Furthermore, we show that translating
        labeled documents to multiple languages leads to additional performance improvements
        for some target languages. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through
        extensive experiments with Yelp restaurant reviews in seven languages. Our
        classifiers identify foodborne illness complaints in multilingual reviews
        from the Yelp Challenge dataset, which highlights the potential of our general

        the Tensor PCA problem introduced by Richard and Montanari (2014), one is
        given a dataset consisting of $n$ samples $\\mathbf{T}_{1:n}$ of i.i.d. Gaussian
        tensors of order $k$ with the promise that $\\mathbb{E}\\mathbf{T}_1$ is a
        rank-1 tensor and $\\|\\mathbb{E} \\mathbf{T}_1\\| = 1$. The goal is to estimate
        $\\mathbb{E} \\mathbf{T}_1$. This problem exhibits a large conjectured hard
        phase when $k>2$: When $d \\lesssim n \\ll d^{\\frac{k}{2}}$ it is information
        theoretically possible to estimate $\\mathbb{E} \\mathbf{T}_1$, but no polynomial
        time estimator is known. We provide a sharp analysis of the optimal sample
        complexity in the Statistical Query (SQ) model and show that SQ algorithms
        with polynomial query complexity not only fail to solve Tensor PCA in the
        conjectured hard phase, but also have a strictly sub-optimal sample complexity
        compared to some polynomial time estimators such as the Richard-Montanari
        spectral estimator. Our analysis reveals that the optimal sample complexity
        in the SQ model depends on whether $\\mathbb{E} \\mathbf{T}_1$ is symmetric
        or not. For symmetric, even order tensors, we also isolate a sample size regime
        in which it is possible to test if $\\mathbb{E} \\mathbf{T}_1 = \\mathbf{0}$
        or $\\mathbb{E}\\mathbf{T}_1 \\neq \\mathbf{0}$ with polynomially many queries
        but not estimate $\\mathbb{E}\\mathbf{T}_1$. Our proofs rely on the Fourier

        "title": "Cross-Lingual Text Classification with Minimal Resources by Transferring
        a Sparse Teacher", "abstract": "Cross-lingual text classification alleviates
        the need for manually labeled documents in a target language by leveraging
        labeled documents from other languages. Existing approaches for transferring
        supervision across languages require expensive cross-lingual resources, such
        as parallel corpora, while less expensive cross-lingual representation learning
        approaches train classifiers without target labeled documents. In this work,
        we propose a cross-lingual teacher-student method, CLTS, that generates \u201cweak\u201d
        supervision in the target language using minimal cross-lingual resources,
        in the form of a small number of word translations. Given a limited translation
        budget, CLTS extracts and transfers only the most important task-specific
        seed words across languages and initializes a teacher classifier based on
        the translated seed words. Then, CLTS iteratively trains a more powerful student
        that also exploits the context of the seed words in unlabeled target documents
        and outperforms the teacher. CLTS is simple and surprisingly effective in
        18 diverse languages: by transferring just 20 seed words, even a bag-of-words
        logistic regression student outperforms state-of-the-art cross-lingual methods
        (e.g., based on multilingual BERT). Moreover, CLTS can accommodate any type
        of student classifier: leveraging a monolingual BERT student leads to further
        improvements and outperforms even more expensive approaches by up to 12% in
        accuracy. Finally, CLTS addresses emerging tasks in low-resource languages
        using just a small number of word translations.", "venue": "Findings", "year":

        the study of fair classifiers that are robust to perturbations in the training

        ignored the design of fair and robust classifiers. In this work, we develop
        classifiers that are fair not only with respect to the training distribution,
        but also for a class of distributions that are weighted perturbations of the
        training samples. We formulate a min-max objective function whose goal is
        to minimize a distributionally robust training loss, and at the same time,
        find a classifier that is fair with respect to a class of distributions. We
        first reduce this problem to finding a fair classifier that is robust with
        respect to the class of distributions. Based on online learning algorithm,
        we develop an iterative algorithm that provably converges to such a fair and
        robust solution. Experiments on standard machine learning fairness datasets
        suggest that, compared to the state-of-the-art fair classifiers, our classifier
        retains fairness guarantees and test accuracy for a large class of perturbations

        "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful algorithms that have been proven
        capable of extracting non-Gaussian information from weak lensing (WL) data
        sets. Understanding which features in the data determine the output of these
        nested, non-linear algorithms is an important but challenging task. We analyze
        a DNN that has been found in previous work to accurately recover cosmological
        parameters in simulated maps of the WL convergence ($\\kappa$). We derive
        constraints on the cosmological parameter pair $(\\Omega_m,\\sigma_8)$ from
        a combination of three commonly used WL statistics (power spectrum, lensing
        peaks, and Minkowski functionals), using ray-traced simulated $\\kappa$ maps.
        We show that the network can improve the inferred parameter constraints relative
        to this combination by $20\\%$ even in the presence of realistic levels of
        shape noise. We apply a series of well established saliency methods to interpret
        the DNN and find that the most relevant pixels are those with extreme $\\kappa$
        values. For noiseless maps, regions with negative $\\kappa$ account for $86-69\\%$
        of the attribution of the DNN output, defined as the square of the saliency
        in input space. In the presence of shape nose, the attribution concentrates
        in high convergence regions, with $36-68\\%$ of the attribution in regions
        with $\\kappa > 3 \\sigma_{\\kappa}$.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

        a fine-grained analysis of the reviews is desirable, because different segments
        (e.g., sentences) of a review may focus on different aspects of the entity
        in question. However, training supervised models for segment-level classification
        requires segment labels, which may be more difficult or expensive to obtain
        than review labels. In this paper, we employ Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
        and use only weak supervision in the form of a single label per review. First,
        we show that when inappropriate MIL aggregation functions are used, then MIL-based
        networks are outperformed by simpler baselines. Second, we propose a new aggregation
        function based on the sigmoid attention mechanism and show that our proposed
        model outperforms the state-of-the-art models for segment-level sentiment
        classification (by up to 9.8% in F1). Finally, we highlight the importance
        of fine-grained predictions in an important public-health application: finding
        actionable reports of foodborne illness. We show that our model achieves 48.6%
        higher recall compared to previous models, thus increasing the chance of identifying

        for aspect extraction where the seed words are considered by the bag-of-words
        classifier (teacher) and distilled to the parameters of a neural network (student).
        Third, we show that regularization encourages the student to consider non-seed
        words for classification and, as a result, the student outperforms the teacher,
        which only considers the seed words. Finally, we empirically show that our

        a model of the user''s reward function with efficient queries. We build an
        adversarial generative model of states and a successor feature (SR) model
        trained over transition experience collected by learning policy. Our method
        uses these models to select state-action pairs, asking the user to comment
        on the optimality or safety, and trains a adversarial neural network to predict
        the rewards. Different from previous papers, which are almost all based on
        uncertainty sampling, the key idea is to actively and efficiently select state-action
        pairs from both on-policy and off-policy experience, by discriminating the
        queried (expert) and unqueried (generated) data and maximizing the efficiency
        of value function learning. We call this method adversarial reward query with
        successor representation. We evaluate the proposed method with simulated human
        on a state-based 2D navigation task, robotic control tasks and the image-based
        video games, which have high-dimensional observation and complex state dynamics.
        The results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms uncertainty-based
        methods on learning reward models, achieving better query efficiency, where
        the adversarial discriminator can make the agent learn human behavior more
        efficiently and the SR can select states which have stronger impact on value
        function. Moreover, the proposed method can also learn to avoid unsafe states
        when training the reward model.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2019, "referenceCount":

        Regression", "abstract": "Risk estimation is at the core of many learning
        systems. The importance of this problem has motivated researchers to propose
        different schemes, such as cross validation, generalized cross validation,
        and Bootstrap. The theoretical properties of such estimators have been extensively
        studied in the low-dimensional settings, where the number of predictors <inline-formula>

        with a rigorous theory is lacking in high-dimensional settings. This paper

        A corner stone of our analysis is a bound that we obtain on the discrepancy

        "title": "Weak lensing cosmology with convolutional neural networks on noisy
        data", "abstract": "\n Weak gravitational lensing is one of the most promising
        cosmological probes of the late universe. Several large ongoing (DES, KiDS,
        HSC) and planned (LSST, Euclid, WFIRST) astronomical surveys attempt to collect
        even deeper and larger scale data on weak lensing. Due to gravitational collapse,
        the distribution of dark matter is non-Gaussian on small scales. However,
        observations are typically evaluated through the two-point correlation function
        of galaxy shear, which does not capture non-Gaussian features of the lensing
        maps. Previous studies attempted to extract non-Gaussian information from
        weak lensing observations through several higher order statistics such as
        the three-point correlation function, peak counts, or Minkowski functionals.
        Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) emerged in the field of computer
        vision with tremendous success, and they offer a new and very promising framework
        to extract information from 2D or 3D astronomical data sets, confirmed by
        recent studies on weak lensing. We show that a CNN is able to yield significantly
        stricter constraints of (\u03c38, \u03a9m) cosmological parameters than the
        power spectrum using convergence maps generated by full N-body simulations
        and ray-tracing, at angular scales and shape noise levels relevant for future
        observations. In a scenario mimicking LSST or Euclid, the CNN yields 2.4\u20132.8\u00a0times
        smaller credible contours than the power spectrum, and 3.5\u20134.2\u00a0times
        smaller at noise levels corresponding to a deep space survey such as WFIRST.
        We also show that at shape noise levels achievable in future space surveys
        the CNN yields 1.4\u20132.1\u00a0times smaller contours than peak counts,
        a higher order statistic capable of extracting non-Gaussian information from
        weak lensing maps.", "venue": "Monthly notices of the Royal Astronomical Society",

        Through Weakly Supervised Co-Training", "abstract": "User-generated reviews
        can be decomposed into fine-grained segments (e.g., sentences, clauses), each
        evaluating a different aspect of the principal entity (e.g., price, quality,
        appearance). Automatically detecting these aspects can be useful for both
        users and downstream opinion mining applications. Current supervised approaches
        for learning aspect classifiers require many fine-grained aspect labels, which
        are labor-intensive to obtain. And, unfortunately, unsupervised topic models
        often fail to capture the aspects of interest. In this work, we consider weakly
        supervised approaches for training aspect classifiers that only require the
        user to provide a small set of seed words (i.e., weakly positive indicators)
        for the aspects of interest. First, we show that current weakly supervised
        approaches fail to leverage the predictive power of seed words for aspect
        detection. Next, we propose a student-teacher approach that effectively leverages
        seed words in a bag-of-words classifier (teacher); in turn, we use the teacher
        to train a second model (student) that is potentially more powerful (e.g.,
        a neural network that uses pre-trained word embeddings). Finally, we show
        that iterative co-training can be used to cope with noisy seed words, leading
        to both improved teacher and student models. Our proposed approach consistently
        outperforms previous weakly supervised approaches (by 14.1 absolute F1 points

        "title": "Unbiased estimators for random design regression", "abstract": "In
        linear regression we wish to estimate the optimum linear least squares predictor
        for a distribution over d-dimensional input points and real-valued responses,
        based on a small sample. Under standard random design analysis, where the
        sample is drawn i.i.d. from the input distribution, the least squares solution
        for that sample can be viewed as the natural estimator of the optimum. Unfortunately,
        this estimator almost always incurs an undesirable bias coming from the randomness
        of the input points. In this paper we show that it is possible to draw a non-i.i.d.
        sample of input points such that, regardless of the response model, the least
        squares solution is an unbiased estimator of the optimum. Moreover, this sample
        can be produced efficiently by augmenting a previously drawn i.i.d. sample
        with an additional set of d points drawn jointly from the input distribution
        rescaled by the squared volume spanned by the points. Motivated by this, we
        develop a theoretical framework for studying volume-rescaled sampling, and
        in the process prove a number of new matrix expectation identities. We use
        them to show that for any input distribution and $\\epsilon>0$ there is a
        random design consisting of $O(d\\log d+ d/\\epsilon)$ points from which an
        unbiased estimator can be constructed whose square loss over the entire distribution
        is with high probability bounded by $1+\\epsilon$ times the loss of the optimum.
        We provide efficient algorithms for generating such unbiased estimators in
        a number of practical settings and support our claims experimentally.", "venue":

        (ML) models trained over sensitive user data to untrusted domains, such as
        end-user devices and wide-access model stores. This creates a need to control
        the data''s leakage through these models. We present Sage, a differentially
        private (DP) ML platform that bounds the cumulative leakage of training data
        through models. Sage builds upon the rich literature on DP ML algorithms and
        contributes pragmatic solutions to two of the most pressing systems challenges
        of global DP: running out of privacy budget and the privacy-utility tradeoff.
        To address the former, we develop block composition, a new privacy loss accounting
        method that leverages the growing database regime of ML workloads to keep
        training models endlessly on a sensitive data stream while enforcing a global
        DP guarantee for the stream. To address the latter, we develop privacy-adaptive
        training, a process that trains a model on growing amounts of data and/or
        with increasing privacy parameters until, with high probability, the model
        meets developer-configured quality criteria. Sage''s methods are designed
        to integrate with TensorFlow-Extended, Google''s open-source ML platform.
        They illustrate how a systems focus on characteristics of ML workloads enables

        Maximization (EM) is among the most popular algorithms for maximum likelihood
        estimation, but it is generally only guaranteed to find its stationary points
        of the log-likelihood objective. The goal of this article is to present theoretical
        and empirical evidence that over-parameterization can help EM avoid spurious
        local optima in the log-likelihood. We consider the problem of estimating
        the mean vectors of a Gaussian mixture model in a scenario where the mixing
        weights are known. Our study shows that the global behavior of EM, when one
        uses an over-parameterized model in which the mixing weights are treated as
        unknown, is better than that when one uses the (correct) model with the mixing
        weights fixed to the known values. For symmetric Gaussians mixtures with two
        components, we prove that introducing the (statistically redundant) weight
        parameters enables EM to find the global maximizer of the log-likelihood starting
        from almost any initial mean parameters, whereas EM without this over-parameterization
        may very often fail. For other Gaussian mixtures, we provide empirical evidence
        that shows similar behavior. Our results corroborate the value of over-parameterization

        $n \\times d$ design matrix in a linear regression problem is given, but the
        response for each point is hidden unless explicitly requested. The goal is
        to observe only a small number $k \\ll n$ of the responses, and then produce
        a weight vector whose sum of square loss over all points is at most $1+\\epsilon$
        times the minimum. A standard approach to this problem is to use i.i.d. leverage
        score sampling, but this approach is known to perform poorly when $k$ is small
        (e.g., $k = d$); in such cases, it is dominated by volume sampling, a joint
        sampling method that explicitly promotes diversity. How these methods compare
        for larger $k$ was not previously understood. \nWe prove that volume sampling
        can have poor behavior for large $k$ - indeed worse than leverage score sampling.
        We also show how to repair volume sampling using a new padding technique.
        We prove that padded volume sampling has at least as good a tail bound as
        leverage score sampling: sample size $k=O(d\\log d + d/\\epsilon)$ suffices
        to guarantee total loss at most $1+\\epsilon$ times the minimum with high
        probability. The main technical challenge is proving tail bounds for the sums
        of dependent random matrices that arise from volume sampling.", "venue": "arXiv.org",

        "title": "Certified Robustness to Adversarial Examples with Differential Privacy",
        "abstract": "Adversarial examples that fool machine learning models, particularly
        deep neural networks, have been a topic of intense research interest, with
        attacks and defenses being developed in a tight back-and-forth. Most past
        defenses are best effort and have been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated
        attacks. Recently a set of certified defenses have been introduced, which
        provide guarantees of robustness to norm-bounded attacks. However these defenses
        either do not scale to large datasets or are limited in the types of models
        they can support. This paper presents the first certified defense that both
        scales to large networks and datasets (such as Google\u2019s Inception network
        for ImageNet) and applies broadly to arbitrary model types. Our defense, called
        PixelDP, is based on a novel connection between robustness against adversarial
        examples and differential privacy, a cryptographically-inspired privacy formalism,
        that provides a rigorous, generic, and flexible foundation for defense.",

        models are trained to achieve zero or near-zero training error in order to
        obtain near-optimal (but non-zero) test error. This phenomenon of strong generalization
        performance for \"overfitted\" / interpolated classifiers appears to be ubiquitous
        in high-dimensional data, having been observed in deep networks, kernel machines,
        boosting and random forests. Their performance is consistently robust even

        "title": "Evaluating Twitter for Foodborne Illness Outbreak Detection in New
        York City", "abstract": "Objective To incorporate data from Twitter into the
        New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene foodborne illness surveillance
        system and evaluate its utility and impact on foodborne illness complaint
        and outbreak detection. Introduction An estimated one in six Americans experience
        illness from the consumption of contaminated food (foodborne illness) annually;
        most are neither diagnosed nor reported to health departments 1 . Eating food
        prepared outside of the home is an established risk factor for foodborne illness
        2 . New York City (NYC) has approximately 24,000 restaurants and >8.5 million
        residents, of whom 78% report eating food prepared outside of the home at
        least once per week 3 . Residents and visitors can report incidents of restaurant-associated
        foodborne illness to a citywide non-emergency information service, 311. In
        2012, the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) began collaborating
        with Columbia University to improve the detection of restaurant-associated
        foodborne illness complaints using a machine learning algorithm and a daily
        feed of Yelp reviews to identify reports of foodborne illness 4 . Annually,
        DOHMH manages over 4,000 restaurant-associated foodborne illness reports received
        via 311 and identified on Yelp which lead to the detection of about 30 outbreaks
        associated with a restaurant in NYC. Given the small number of foodborne illness
        outbreaks identified, it is probable that many restaurant-associated foodborne
        illness incidents remain unreported. DOHMH sought to incorporate and evaluate
        an additional data source, Twitter, to enhance foodborne illness complaint
        and outbreak detection efforts in NYC. Methods DOHMH epidemiologists continue
        to collaborate with computer scientists at Columbia University who developed
        a text mining algorithm that identifies tweets indicating foodborne illness.
        Twitter data are received via a targeted application program interface query
        that searches for foodborne illness key words and uses metadata to select
        for tweets with a possible NYC location. Each tweet is assigned a sick score
        between 0\u20131; those meeting a threshold value of 0.5 are manually reviewed
        by an epidemiologist, and a survey link is tweeted to users who have tweeted
        about foodborne illness, requesting more information regarding the date and
        time of the foodborne illness event, restaurant details, and user contact
        information. Survey data are used to validate complaints and are incorporated
        in a daily analysis using all sources of complaint data to identify restaurants
        with multiple foodborne illness complaints within a 30-day period. This system
        was launched on November 29, 2016. Results During November 29, 2016\u2013September
        27, 2017, 12,015 tweets qualified for review (39/day on average); 2,288 (19.0%)
        indicated foodborne illness in NYC, and 1,778 (14.8%) were tweeted a survey
        link (510 foodborne illness tweets were either deleted by the Twitter user
        or were tweets from a user who was already sent a survey for the same foodborne
        illness incident). The survey tweets resulted in 92 likes, 12 retweets, 65
        replies, 232 profile views and 348 survey link clicks. Of the 1,778 surveys
        sent, 27 were completed (response rate 1.5%), of which 20 (74.7%) confirmed
        foodborne illness associated with a NYC restaurant; none had been reported
        via 311/Yelp. Of those, 11 (55%) provided a phone number, of which 10 (90.9%)
        completed phone interviews. The completed surveys contributed to the identification
        of two restaurants with multiple foodborne illness complaints within a 30-day
        period. Conclusions The utility of Twitter for foodborne illness outbreak
        detection continues to be evaluated. While the survey response rate has been
        low, the identification of new complaints not otherwise reported to 311 and
        Yelp suggests this will be a useful tool. Future plans include using feedback
        data collected by DOHMH epidemiologist review to increase the sensitivity
        and specificity of the text mining algorithm and improve the location detection
        for Twitter users. In addition, we plan to implement enhancements to the survey
        and create a web page to promote survey responses. Furthermore, we intend
        to share this system with other health departments so that they might incorporate
        Twitter in their outbreak detection and public health surveillance activities.

        of the k-dimensional projection, i.e., the index space. This model is called
        the multi-index model, and the k = 1 case is called the single-index model.
        For the single-index model, we characterize the population landscape of a

        in Machine Learning", "abstract": "Adversarial examples in machine learning
        has been a topic of intense research interest, with attacks and defenses being
        developed in a tight back-and-forth. Most past defenses are best-effort, heuristic
        approaches that have all been shown to be vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.
        More recently, rigorous defenses that provide formal guarantees have emerged,
        but are hard to scale or generalize. A rigorous and general foundation for
        designing defenses is required to get us off this arms race trajectory. We
        propose leveraging differential privacy (DP) as a formal building block for
        robustness against adversarial examples. We observe that the semantic of DP
        is closely aligned with the formal definition of robustness to adversarial
        examples. We propose PixelDP, a strategy for learning robust deep neural networks
        based on formal DP guarantees. PixelDP networks give theoretical guarantees
        for a subset of their predictions regarding the robustness against adversarial
        perturbations of bounded size. Our evaluation with MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
        shows that PixelDP networks achieve accuracy under attack on par with the
        best-performing defense to date, but additionally certify robustness against
        meaningful-size 1-norm and 2-norm attacks for 40-60% of their predictions.

        an n x d design matrix in a linear regression problem is given, but the response
        for each point is hidden unless explicitly requested. The goal is to sample
        only a small number k << n of the responses, and then produce a weight vector
        whose sum of squares loss over *all* points is at most 1+epsilon times the
        minimum. When k is very small (e.g., k=d), jointly sampling diverse subsets
        of points is crucial. One such method called \"volume sampling\" has a unique
        and desirable property that the weight vector it produces is an unbiased estimate
        of the optimum. It is therefore natural to ask if this method offers the optimal
        unbiased estimate in terms of the number of responses k needed to achieve
        a 1+epsilon loss approximation. Surprisingly we show that volume sampling
        can have poor behavior when we require a very accurate approximation -- indeed
        worse than some i.i.d. sampling techniques whose estimates are biased, such
        as leverage score sampling. We then develop a new rescaled variant of volume
        sampling that produces an unbiased estimate which avoids this bad behavior
        and has at least as good a tail bound as leverage score sampling: sample size
        k=O(d log d + d/epsilon) suffices to guarantee total loss at most 1+epsilon
        times the minimum with high probability. Thus, we improve on the best previously
        known sample size for an unbiased estimator, k=O(d^2/epsilon). Our rescaling
        procedure leads to a new efficient algorithm for volume sampling which is
        based on a \"determinantal rejection sampling\" technique with potentially
        broader applications to determinantal point processes. Other contributions
        include introducing the combinatorics needed for rescaled volume sampling

        "abstract": "The question of generalization in machine learning---how algorithms
        are able to learn predictors from a training sample to make accurate predictions
        out-of-sample---is revisited in light of the recent breakthroughs in modern
        machine learning technology. \nThe classical approach to understanding generalization
        is based on bias-variance trade-offs, where model complexity is carefully
        calibrated so that the fit on the training sample reflects performance out-of-sample.
        \nHowever, it is now common practice to fit highly complex models like deep
        neural networks to data with (nearly) zero training error, and yet these interpolating
        predictors are observed to have good out-of-sample accuracy even for noisy
        data. \nHow can the classical understanding of generalization be reconciled
        with these observations from modern machine learning practice? \nIn this paper,
        we bridge the two regimes by exhibiting a new \"double descent\" risk curve
        that extends the traditional U-shaped bias-variance curve beyond the point
        of interpolation. \nSpecifically, the curve shows that as soon as the model
        complexity is high enough to achieve interpolation on the training sample---a
        point that we call the \"interpolation threshold\"---the risk of suitably
        chosen interpolating predictors from these models can, in fact, be decreasing
        as the model complexity increases, often below the risk achieved using non-interpolating
        models. \nThe double descent risk curve is demonstrated for a broad range
        of models, including neural networks and random forests, and a mechanism for
        producing this behavior is posited.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2018,

        trade-off", "abstract": "Significance While breakthroughs in machine learning
        and artificial intelligence are changing society, our fundamental understanding
        has lagged behind. It is traditionally believed that fitting models to the
        training data exactly is to be avoided as it leads to poor performance on
        unseen data. However, powerful modern classifiers frequently have near-perfect
        fit in training, a disconnect that spurred recent intensive research and controversy
        on whether theory provides practical insights. In this work, we show how classical
        theory and modern practice can be reconciled within a single unified performance
        curve and propose a mechanism underlying its emergence. We believe this previously
        unknown pattern connecting the structure and performance of learning architectures
        will help shape design and understanding of learning algorithms. Breakthroughs
        in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental
        understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the
        central tenets of the field, the bias\u2013variance trade-off, appears to
        be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning
        practice. The bias\u2013variance trade-off implies that a model should balance
        underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure
        in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in
        modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly
        fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered
        overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent
        contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine
        learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile
        the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance
        curve. This \u201cdouble-descent\u201d curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped
        bias\u2013variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity
        beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide
        evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum
        of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection
        between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates
        the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory
        and the practice of machine learning.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National

        "Objective\nWe developed a system for the discovery of foodborne illness mentioned
        in online Yelp restaurant reviews using text classification. The system is
        used by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH)
        to monitor Yelp for foodborne illness complaints.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nWe
        built classifiers for 2 tasks: (1) determining if a review indicated a person
        experiencing foodborne illness and (2) determining if a review indicated multiple
        people experiencing foodborne illness. We first developed a prototype classifier
        in 2012 for both tasks using a small labeled dataset. Over years of system
        deployment, DOHMH epidemiologists labeled 13\u2009526 reviews selected by
        this classifier. We used these biased data and a sample of complementary reviews
        in a principled bias-adjusted training scheme to develop significantly improved
        classifiers. Finally, we performed an error analysis of the best resulting
        classifiers.\n\n\nResults\nWe found that logistic regression trained with
        bias-adjusted augmented data performed best for both classification tasks,
        with F1-scores of 87% and 66% for tasks 1 and 2, respectively.\n\n\nDiscussion\nOur
        error analysis revealed that the inability of our models to account for long
        phrases caused the most errors. Our bias-adjusted training scheme illustrates
        how to improve a classification system iteratively by exploiting available
        biased labeled data.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur system has been instrumental in
        the identification of 10 outbreaks and 8523 complaints of foodborne illness
        associated with New York City restaurants since July 2012. Our evaluation
        has identified strong classifiers for both tasks, whose deployment will allow

        "title": "Coding sets with asymmetric information", "abstract": "We study
        the following one-way asymmetric transmission problem, also a variant of model-based
        compressed sensing: a resource-limited encoder has to report a small set $S$
        from a universe of $N$ items to a more powerful decoder (server). The distinguishing
        feature is asymmetric information: the subset $S$ is comprised of i.i.d. samples
        from a prior distribution $\\mu$, and $\\mu$ is only known to the decoder.
        The goal for the encoder is to encode $S$ obliviously, while achieving the
        information-theoretic bound of $|S| \\cdot H(\\mu)$, i.e., the Shannon entropy
        bound. \nWe first show that any such compression scheme must be {\\em randomized},
        if it gains non-trivially from the prior $\\mu$. This stands in contrast to
        the symmetric case (when both the encoder and decoder know $\\mu$), where
        the Huffman code provides a near-optimal deterministic solution. On the other
        hand, a rather simple argument shows that, when $|S|=k$, a random linear code
        achieves near-optimal communication rate of about $k\\cdot H(\\mu)$ bits.
        Alas, the resulting scheme has prohibitive decoding time: about ${N\\choose
        k} \\approx (N/k)^k$. \nOur main result is a computationally efficient and
        linear coding scheme, which achieves an $O(\\lg\\lg N)$-competitive communication
        ratio compared to the optimal benchmark, and runs in $\\text{poly}(N,k)$ time.
        Our \"multi-level\" coding scheme uses a combination of hashing and syndrome-decoding
        of Reed-Solomon codes, and relies on viewing the (unknown) prior $\\mu$ as

        needs to report a small subset $S$ from a universe of $N$ objects to a more

        is an essential element of virtually all kernel methods for nonparametric
        regression problems. A critical factor in the e\ufb00ectiveness of a given
        kernel method is the type of regularization that is employed. This article
        compares and contrasts members from a general class of regularization techniques,
        which notably includes ridge regression and principal component regression.
        We derive an explicit \ufb01nite-sample risk bound for regularization-based
        estimators that simultaneously accounts for (i) the structure of the ambient
        function space, (ii) the regularity of the true regression function, and (iii)
        the adaptability (or quali\ufb01cation ) of the regularization. A simple consequence
        of this upper bound is that the risk of the regularization-based estimators
        matches the minimax rate in a vari- ety of settings. The general bound also
        illustrates how some regularization techniques are more adaptable than others
        to favorable regularity prop- erties that the true regression function may

        "We study large-scale kernel methods for acoustic modeling in speech recognition
        and compare their performance to deep neural networks (DNNs). We perform experiments
        on four speech recognition datasets, including the TIMIT and Broadcast News
        benchmark tasks, and compare these two types of models on frame-level performance
        metrics (accuracy, cross-entropy), as well as on recognition metrics (word/character
        error rate). In order to scale kernel methods to these large datasets, we
        use the random Fourier feature method of Rahimi and Recht [2007]. We propose
        two novel techniques for improving the performance of kernel acoustic models.
        First, in order to reduce the number of random features required by kernel
        models, we propose a simple but effective method for feature selection. The
        method is able to explore a large number of non-linear features while maintaining
        a compact model more efficiently than existing approaches. Second, we present
        a number of frame-level metrics which correlate very strongly with recognition
        performance when computed on the heldout set; we take advantage of these correlations
        by monitoring these metrics during training in order to decide when to stop
        learning. This technique can noticeably improve the recognition performance
        of both DNN and kernel models, while narrowing the gap between them. Additionally,
        we show that the linear bottleneck method of Sainath et al. [2013a] improves
        the performance of our kernel models significantly, in addition to speeding
        up training and making the models more compact. Together, these three methods
        dramatically improve the performance of kernel acoustic models, making their
        performance comparable to DNNs on the tasks we explored.", "venue": "Journal

        considers algorithmic and statistical aspects of linear regression when the

        a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme is given for the natural least
        squares optimization problem in any constant dimension. Next, in an average-case
        and noise-free setting where the responses exactly correspond to a linear
        function of i.i.d. draws from a standard multivariate normal distribution,
        an efficient algorithm based on lattice basis reduction is shown to exactly
        recover the unknown linear function in arbitrary dimension. Finally, lower

        (ii) the regularity of the true regression function, and (iii) the adaptability
        (or qualification) of the regularization. A simple consequence of this upper
        bound is that the risk of the regularization-based estimators matches the
        minimax rate in a variety of settings. The general bound also illustrates
        how some regularization techniques are more adaptable than others to favorable
        regularity properties that the true regression function may possess. This,

        adding the center from a candidate set that maximally decreases clustering
        cost. In the case of $k$-medians and $k$-means, the key results are as follows.
        \n$\\bullet$ When the method considers all data points as candidate centers,
        then selecting $\\mathcal{O}(k\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ centers achieves cost
        at most $2+\\varepsilon$ times the optimal cost with $k$ centers. \n$\\bullet$

        candidate centers proportionally to their cluster cost (as with $\\texttt{kmeans++}$,
        but holding centers fixed). \n$\\bullet$ In the case of $k$-means, considering

        $1+\\varepsilon$ approximation with $\\mathcal{O}(k\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$

        executions of stochastic gradient descent with adaptively determined constraint

        the symmetric canonical decomposition of an underlying symmetric and orthogonally

        necessitate that the input tensor can only be assumed to be a nearly SOD tensor---i.e.,
        a symmetric tensor slightly perturbed from the underlying SOD tensor. This
        paper shows that even in the presence of perturbation, SROA can still robustly
        recover the symmetric canonical decomposition of the underlying tensor. It

        "title": "FairTest: Discovering Unwarranted Associations in Data-Driven Applications",
        "abstract": "In a world where traditional notions of privacy are increasingly
        challenged by the myriad companies that collect and analyze our data, it is
        important that decision-making entities are held accountable for unfair treatments
        arising from irresponsible data usage. Unfortunately, a lack of appropriate
        methodologies and tools means that even identifying unfair or discriminatory
        effects can be a challenge in practice. We introduce the unwarranted associations
        (UA) framework, a principled methodology for the discovery of unfair, discriminatory,
        or offensive user treatment in data-driven applications. The UA framework
        unifies and rationalizes a number of prior attempts at formalizing algorithmic
        fairness. It uniquely combines multiple investigative primitives and fairness
        metrics with broad applicability, granular exploration of unfair treatment
        in user subgroups, and incorporation of natural notions of utility that may
        account for observed disparities. We instantiate the UA framework in FairTest,
        the first comprehensive tool that helps developers check data-driven applications
        for unfair user treatment. It enables scalable and statistically rigorous
        investigation of associations between application outcomes (such as prices
        or premiums) and sensitive user attributes (such as race or gender). Furthermore,
        FairTest provides debugging capabilities that let programmers rule out potential
        confounders for observed unfair effects. We report on use of FairTest to investigate
        and in some cases address disparate impact, offensive labeling, and uneven
        rates of algorithmic error in four data-driven applications. As examples,
        our results reveal subtle biases against older populations in the distribution
        of error in a predictive health application and offensive racial labeling

        Sample Path", "abstract": "This article provides the first procedure for computing
        a fully data-dependent interval that traps the mixing time $t_{\\text{mix}}$
        of a finite reversible ergodic Markov chain at a prescribed confidence level.
        The interval is computed from a single finite-length sample path from the
        Markov chain, and does not require the knowledge of any parameters of the
        chain. This stands in contrast to previous approaches, which either only provide
        point estimates, or require a reset mechanism, or additional prior knowledge.
        The interval is constructed around the relaxation time $t_{\\text{relax}}$,
        which is strongly related to the mixing time, and the width of the interval
        converges to zero roughly at a $\\sqrt{n}$ rate, where $n$ is the length of
        the sample path. Upper and lower bounds are given on the number of samples
        required to achieve constant-factor multiplicative accuracy. The lower bounds
        indicate that, unless further restrictions are placed on the chain, no procedure
        can achieve this accuracy level before seeing each state at least $\\Omega(t_{\\text{relax}})$

        programmers routinely incorporate user data into complex algorithms, heuristics,
        and application pipelines. While often beneficial, this practice can have
        unintended and detrimental consequences, such as the discriminatory effects
        identified in Staples'' online pricing algorithm and the racially offensive
        labels recently found in Google''s image tagger. We argue that such effects
        are bugs that should be tested for and debugged in a manner similar to functionality,
        performance, and security bugs. We describe FairTest, a testing toolkit that
        detects unwarranted associations between an algorithm''s outputs (e.g., prices
        or labels) and user subpopulations, including protected groups (e.g., defined
        by race or gender). FairTest reports any statistically significant associations

        Confidence", "abstract": "We present Sunlight, a system that detects the causes
        of targeting phenomena on the web -- such as personalized advertisements,
        recommendations, or content -- at large scale and with solid statistical confidence.
        Today''s web is growing increasingly complex and impenetrable as myriad of
        services collect, analyze, use, and exchange users'' personal information.
        No one can tell who has what data, for what purposes they are using it, and
        how those uses affect the users. The few studies that exist reveal problematic
        effects -- such as discriminatory pricing and advertising -- but they are
        either too small-scale to generalize or lack formal assessments of confidence
        in the results, making them difficult to trust or interpret. Sunlight brings
        a principled and scalable methodology to personal data measurements by adapting
        well-established methods from statistics for the specific problem of targeting
        detection. Our methodology formally separates different operations into four
        key phases: scalable hypothesis generation, interpretable hypothesis formation,
        statistical significance testing, and multiple testing correction. Each phase
        bears instantiations from multiple mechanisms from statistics, each making
        different assumptions and tradeoffs. Sunlight offers a modular design that
        allows exploration of this vast design space. We explore a portion of this
        space, thoroughly evaluating the tradeoffs both analytically and experimentally.
        Our exploration reveals subtle tensions between scalability and confidence.
        Sunlight''s default functioning strikes a balance to provide the first system
        that can diagnose targeting at fine granularity, at scale, and with solid
        statistical justification of its results. We showcase our system by running
        two measurement studies of targeting on the web, both the largest of their
        kind. Our studies -- about ad targeting in Gmail and on the web -- reveal
        statistically justifiable evidence that contradicts two Google statements
        regarding the lack of targeting on sensitive and prohibited topics.", "venue":

        is widely used in natural language processing (NLP) to derive lexical representations
        that are then used to improve performance on various NLP problems. The algorithm
        assumes an underlying model that is essentially an HMM, with the restriction
        that each word in the vocabulary is emitted from a single state. A greedy,
        bottom-up method is then used to find the clustering; this method does not
        have a guarantee of finding the correct underlying clustering. In this paper
        we describe a new algorithm for clustering under the Brown et al. model. The
        method relies on two steps: first, the use of canonical correlation analysis
        to derive a low-dimensional representation of words; second, a bottom-up hierarchical
        clustering over these representations. We show that given a sufficient number
        of training examples sampled from the Brown et al. model, the method is guaranteed
        to recover the correct clustering. Experiments show that the method recovers
        clusters of comparable quality to the algorithm of Brown et al. (1992), but

        responsible for mysteriously accelerating the expansion of the universe. The
        most promising method to study dark energy is the measurement of the subtle
        distortions in the shapes of distant background galaxies. These distortions
        are caused by gravitational lensing, and their properties depend on the nature
        of dark energy. Vast lensing maps will be generated in the next decade from
        several large astronomical surveys. The power spectrum of these maps is currently
        considered the most powerful future probe of dark energy, though we have found
        that higher-order statistics extract at least a comparable amount of complementary
        information from non-Gaussian features. However, the total cosmological information

        not well supported by existing technology. Traditional information extraction
        approaches do not work well over the highly informal, noisy, and ungrammatical
        text common in social media, and they do not handle the extraction and aggregation
        of the rare content that important applications need to extract from high-volume
        streaming sources. In our ongoing collaborative project between Columbia University
        and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), we
        aim to address these gaps in research and technology for one important public
        health application, namely, detecting and acting on foodborne outbreaks in
        New York City restaurants. Thus far, we have been able to address these issues
        successfully and have used one social media site to identify and follow up
        on several foodborne outbreaks that had not been reported through conventional
        channels. 1. DETECTING AND ACTING ON FOODBORNE OUTBREAKS The Centers for Disease
        Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 6 Americans, or 48 million
        people, get sick from a foodborne disease each year. Of confirmed foodborne
        outbreaks investigated nationally, 45% are restaurantrelated [20]. The New
        York City DOHMH is the agency with primary responsibility for foodborne disease
        detection and Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of

        ...$15.00. outbreak investigations in New York City. New York City hosts approximately
        24,000 restaurants and 15,000 food retail establishments (e.g., grocery stores,
        delis). Citizens can report illnesses associated with such venues through
        the official 311 telephone line and its associated website and app. Once an
        outbreak is identified, DOHMH launches an investigation that includes a restaurant
        inspection, testing food and clinical specimens, and collecting symptom and
        food exposure data from restaurant patrons, as well as conducting statistical
        analysis to implicate a food item; finally, DOHMH takes action to stop the
        outbreak (e.g., by removing a contaminated food item) and prevent its recurrence
        (e.g., through education). Unfortunately, only about 30 restaurant-associated
        foodborne outbreaks are reported annually, so almost certainly many such outbreaks
        are not reported to the government through the official channels, which has
        potentially serious public health repercussions. In fact, investigated outbreaks
        are thought to represent only a small fraction of all foodborne outbreaks
        [6]. As we reported in [10], in a study of 294,000 New York City restaurant
        reviews on the Yelp website we discovered that only 3% of the illnesses that
        we identified had been reported through the official New York City channels,
        which highlights the importance of extracting this valuable, otherwiseunreported
        outbreak-related information from social media, so that the government can
        analyze it and launch investigations when appropriate. Figure 1(a) shows Yelp
        and Twitter posts about a potential food poisoning incident at a New York
        City restaurant. Since January 2012, we have had a fruitful, ongoing collaboration
        between the Computer Science Department at Columbia University and the New
        York City DOHMH, hence combining Columbia\u2019s expertise in Computer Science
        with the DOHMH\u2019s domain knowledge and infrastructure for the important
        application at hand. Overall, the goal of this collaboration is to identify
        and analyze the unprecedented volumes of user-contributed opinions and comments
        about restaurants on social media sites, to extract reliable indicators of
        disease outbreaks associated with the restaurants, an important public health
        task. We have already produced a proof-of-concept, operational prototype over
        Yelp data. (Yelp has been graciously producing now-daily feeds of New York
        City restaurant reviews for our use in our project.) Our prototype has been
        used by the DOHMH since July 2012. Our system processes each Yelp review with
        multiple classifiers, developed through supervised machine learning to detect
        (1) whether the review discusses a potential food poisoning incident; (2)
        whether the review hints at an incu-", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount":

        : Overcomplete latent representations have been very popular for unsupervised

        probabilistic admixture or topic models in the overcomplete regime. While

        natural settings, the analysis goal is not to characterize a single data set
        in isolation, but rather to understand the difference between one set of observations
        and another. For example, given a background corpus of news articles together
        with writings of a particular author, one may want a topic model that explains
        word patterns and themes specific to the author. Another example comes from
        genomics, in which biological signals may be collected from different regions
        of a genome, and one wants a model that captures the differential statistics
        observed in these regions. This paper formalizes this notion of contrastive
        learning for mixture models, and develops spectral algorithms for inferring
        mixture components specific to a foreground data set when contrasted with
        a background data set. The method builds on recent moment-based estimators
        and tensor decompositions for latent variable models, and has the intuitive
        feature of using background data statistics to appropriately modify moments
        estimated from foreground data. A key advantage of the method is that the
        background data need only be coarsely modeled, which is important when the
        background is too complex, noisy, or not of interest. The method is demonstrated
        on applications in contrastive topic modeling and genomic sequence analysis.",

        Title", "abstract": "This work considers a computationally and statistically
        e?cient parameter estimation method for a wide class of latent variable models\u2014including
        Gaussian mixture models, hidden Markov models, and latent Dirichlet allocation\u2014which
        exploits a certain tensor structure in their loworder observable moments (typically,
        of secondand third-order). Speci?cally, parameter estimation is reduced to
        the problem of extracting a certain (orthogonal) decomposition of a symmetric
        tensor derived from the moments; this decomposition can be viewed as a natural
        generalization of the singular value decomposition for matrices. Although
        tensor decompositions are generally intractable to compute, the decomposition
        of these specially structured tensors can be e?ciently obtained by a variety
        of approaches, including power iterations and maximization approaches (similar
        to the case of matrices). A detailed analysis of a robust tensor power method
        is provided, establishing an analogue of Wedin\u2019s perturbation theorem
        for the singular vectors of matrices. This implies a robust and computationally
        tractable estimation approach for several popular latent variable models Tensor

        variable models is a fundamental problem central to numerous applications
        of machine learning and statistics. This work presents a principled approach
        for estimating broad classes of such models, including probabilistic topic
        models and latent linear Bayesian networks, using only second-order observed
        moments. The sufficient conditions for identifiability of these models are
        primarily based on weak expansion constraints on the topic-word matrix, for
        topic models, and on the directed acyclic graph, for Bayesian networks. Because
        no assumptions are made on the distribution among the latent variables, the
        approach can handle arbitrary correlations among the topics or latent factors.
        In addition, a tractable learning method via $\\ell_1$ optimization is proposed

        parsing models. Second, for identifiable models, how do we estimate the parameters
        efficiently? EM suffers from local optima, while recent work using spectral
        methods [1] cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parse tree

        "This work considers a computationally and statistically efficient parameter
        estimation method for a wide class of latent variable models--including Gaussian
        mixture models, hidden Markov models, and latent Dirichlet allocation--which
        exploits a certain tensor structure in their low-order observable moments
        (typically, of second- and third-order). Specifically, parameter estimation
        is reduced to the problem of extracting a certain (orthogonal) decomposition
        of a symmetric tensor derived from the moments; this decomposition can be
        viewed as a natural generalization of the singular value decomposition for
        matrices. Although tensor decompositions are generally intractable to compute,
        the decomposition of these specially structured tensors can be efficiently
        obtained by a variety of approaches, including power iterations and maximization
        approaches (similar to the case of matrices). A detailed analysis of a robust
        tensor power method is provided, establishing an analogue of Wedin''s perturbation
        theorem for the singular vectors of matrices. This implies a robust and computationally
        tractable estimation approach for several popular latent variable models.",

        "We consider unsupervised estimation of mixtures of discrete graphical models,
        where the class variable corresponding to the mixture components is hidden
        and each mixture component over the observed variables can have a potentially
        different Markov graph structure and parameters. We propose a novel approach
        for estimating the mixture components, and our output is a tree-mixture model
        which serves as a good approximation to the underlying graphical model mixture.
        Our method is efficient when the union graph, which is the union of the Markov
        graphs of the mixture components, has sparse vertex separators between any
        pair of observed variables. This includes tree mixtures and mixtures of bounded
        degree graphs. For such models, we prove that our method correctly recovers
        the union graph structure and the tree structures corresponding to maximum-likelihood

        modeling can be seen as a generalization of the clustering problem, in that
        it posits that observations are generated due to multiple latent factors (e.g.,
        the words in each document are generated as a mixture of several active topics,
        as opposed to just one). This increased representational power comes at the
        cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the
        topic probability vectors (the distributions over words for each topic), when
        only the words are observed and the corresponding topics are hidden. We provide
        a simple and efficient learning procedure that is guaranteed to recover the
        parameters for a wide class of mixture models, including the popular latent
        Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model. For LDA, the procedure correctly recovers
        both the topic probability vectors and the prior over the topics, using only

        documents containing just three words). The method, termed Excess Correlation
        Analysis (ECA), is based on a spectral decomposition of low order moments

        current practice for estimating the parameters of such models relies on local
        search heuristics (e.g., the EM algorithm) which are prone to failure, and

        Differentially private solutions enforce privacy by adding random noise to

        is to control the added noise in order to optimize the privacy-accuracy-sample

        "title": "Sample Complexity Bounds for Differentially Private Learning", "abstract":
        "This work studies the problem of privacy-preserving classification - namely,
        learning a classifier from sensitive data while preserving the privacy of
        individuals in the training set. In particular, the learning algorithm is
        required in this problem to guarantee differential privacy, a very strong
        notion of privacy that has gained significant attention in recent years. A
        natural question to ask is: what is the sample requirement of a learning algorithm
        that guarantees a certain level of privacy and accuracy? We address this question
        in the context of learning with infinite hypothesis classes when the data
        is drawn from a continuous distribution. We first show that even for very
        simple hypothesis classes, any algorithm that uses a finite number of examples
        and guarantees differential privacy must fail to return an accurate classifier
        for at least some unlabeled data distributions. This result is unlike the
        case with either finite hypothesis classes or discrete data domains, in which
        distribution-free private learning is possible, as previously shown by Kasiviswanathan
        et al. (2008). We then consider two approaches to differentially private learning
        that get around this lower bound. The first approach is to use prior knowledge
        about the unlabeled data distribution in the form of a reference distribution
        chosen independently of the sensitive data. Given such a reference , we provide
        an upper bound on the sample requirement that depends (among other things)
        on a measure of closeness between and the unlabeled data distribution. Our
        upper bound applies to the non-realizable as well as the realizable case.
        The second approach is to relax the privacy requirement, by requiring only
        label-privacy - namely, that the only labels (and not the unlabeled parts
        of the examples) be considered sensitive information. An upper bound on the
        sample requirement of learning with label privacy was shown by Chaudhuri et
        al. (2006); in this work, we show a lower bound.", "venue": "Annual Conference

        graphical models with continuous, discrete, and mixed latent variables such

        Recursive Grouping algorithm, an efficient and simple bottom-up procedure
        for recovering the tree structure from independent samples of the observed
        variables. Our finite sample size bounds for exact recovery of the tree structure
        reveal certain natural dependencies on underlying statistical and structural

        "We address the problem of learning in an online setting where the learner
        repeatedly observes features, selects among a set of actions, and receives
        reward for the action taken. We provide the first efficient algorithm with
        an optimal regret. Our algorithm uses a cost sensitive classification learner
        as an oracle and has a running time polylog(N), where N is the number of classification
        rules among which the oracle might choose. This is exponentially faster than
        all previous algorithms that achieve optimal regret in this setting. Our formulation
        also enables us to create an algorithm with regret that is additive rather

        "title": "Algorithms for active learning", "abstract": "This dissertation
        develops and analyzes active learning algorithms for binary classification
        problems. In passive (non-active) learning, a learner uses a random sample
        of labeled examples from a fixed distribution to select a hypothesis with
        low error. In active learning, a learner receives only a sample of unlabeled
        data, but has the option to query the label of any of these data points. The
        hope is that the active learner needs to query the labels of just a few, carefully
        chosen points in order to produce a hypothesis with low error. \nThe first
        part of this dissertation develops algorithms based on maintaining a version
        space\u2014the set of hypotheses still in contention to be selected. The version
        space is specifically designed to tolerate arbitrary label noise and model
        mismatch in the agnostic learning model. The algorithms maintain the version
        space using a reduction to a special form of agnostic learning that allows
        for example-based constraints; this represents a computational improvement
        over previous methods. The generalization behavior of one of these algorithms
        is rigorously analyzed using a quantity called the disagreement coefficient.
        This algorithm is shown to have label complexity that improves over that of
        previous methods, and matches known label complexity lower bounds in certain
        cases. \nThe second part of this dissertation develops algorithms based on
        simpler reductions to agnostic learning that more closely match the standard
        abstraction of supervised learning procedures. The generalization behavior
        of these algorithms are also analyzed in the agnostic learning model, and
        are shown to have label complexity similar to the version space methods. Therefore,
        these algorithms represent qualitative improvements over version space methods,
        as strict version space methods can be risky to deploy in practice. The first
        of these algorithms is based on a relaxation of a version space method, and
        the second is based on an importance weighting technique. The second algorithm
        is also shown to automatically adapt to various noise conditions that imply
        a tighter label complexity analysis. Experiments using this algorithm are
        also presented to illustrate some of the promise of the method.", "venue":

        that has proved theoretically profitable is to maintain a candidate set of
        hypotheses (sometimes called a version space), and to query the label of a
        point if and only if there is disagreement within this set about how to label
        the point. The criteria for membership in this candidate set need to be carefully
        defined so that the optimal hypothesis h\u2217 is always included, but otherwise
        this set can be quickly whittled down as more labels are queried. This technique
        is rather straightforward in the realizable setting [3], and it can be extended
        to the agnostic setting with the use of confidence bounds and hard example
        constraints [1, 4]. One of the algorithms in [2] uses large importance weights
        to essentially achieve the same effect.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

        consider multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the

        making this approach radically more efficient than others. We also state and

        "The goal of this research was to explore how filial piety and interpersonal
        contact with gay persons relates to attitudes toward lesbians and gay men
        in a Chinese sample from Taiwan. Sex differences of respondents and the intensity
        differences of attitudes toward lesbians and gay men were also investigated.
        The participants were 187 undergraduates (68 males, 119 females) from a major
        University in Taiwan. The Filial Piety Scale (Ho & Lee, 1974) and The Attitudes
        Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (Herek, 1988) were employed. The results
        indicate that respondents'' attitudes toward lesbians and gay men are correlated
        with filial piety and interpersonal contact. However, the contact effect only
        holds for men, not for women. In addition, men hold more intolerant attitudes
        toward lesbians and gay men than do women. These findings support the notion
        that internalized filial piety relates to Chinese people''s intolerant attitudes
        toward lesbians and gay men. Thus, negative attitudes toward gay persons serve
        a functional purpose (Herek, 1986, 1987, 1994).", "venue": "", "year": 2001,

        "We introduce a tensor-based model of shared representation for meta-learning
        from a diverse set of tasks. Prior works on learning linear representations
        for meta-learning assume that there is a common shared representation across
        different tasks, and do not consider the additional task-specific observable
        side information. In this work, we model the meta-parameter through an order-$3$
        tensor, which can adapt to the observed task features of the task. We propose
        two methods to estimate the underlying tensor. The first method solves a tensor
        regression problem and works under natural assumptions on the data generating
        process. The second method uses the method of moments under additional distributional
        assumptions and has an improved sample complexity in terms of the number of
        tasks. We also focus on the meta-test phase, and consider estimating task-specific
        parameters on a new task. Substituting the estimated tensor from the first
        step allows us estimating the task-specific parameters with very few samples
        of the new task, thereby showing the benefits of learning tensor representations
        for meta-learning. Finally, through simulation and several real-world datasets,
        we evaluate our methods and show that it improves over previous linear models
        of shared representations for meta-learning.", "venue": "International Conference

        that by increasing the field from 0 to 5 Tesla, the critical current Ic of

        in the NCMO/YBCO bilayer Ic is less sensitive to the field and maintains at
        the level of 100 mA at high field. This result indicates that the magnetic

        is a 32-channel head coil at 1.5T when compared with a 12-channel coil? Does
        the higher spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio affect clinical interpretations?
        Here, 21 patients were consecutively imaged with both coils and the results
        in axial T2, T1, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, and diffusion-weighted
        imaging sequences were assessed. Most of the improvement was seen in the FLAIR,
        DWI, and T2 sequences and to a lesser extent on T1 images. Artifacts were
        similar with both coils. Conclusion: Improvements in SNR and spatial resolution
        attributed to image acquisition with a 32-channel head coil are paralleled
        by perceived improvements in image quality. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Multichannel
        phased-array head coils are undergoing exponential escalation of coil element
        numbers. While previous technical studies have found gains in SNR and spatial
        resolution with the addition of element coils, it remains to be determined

        was to determine if the SNR and spatial resolution characteristics of a 32-channel

        necked intracranial aneurysms require antiplatelets to prevent stent thrombosis.
        The effect of the loading dose of antiplatelets prior to the stent coiling
        procedure in an unsecured wide necked ruptured intracranial aneurysm is not
        known. Objective To report any potential complication associated with the
        use of both aspirin and clopidogrel in stent assisted coiling of ruptured
        wide necked intracranial aneurysms. Methods Consecutive patients who underwent
        stent assisted coiling for ruptured wide necked intracranial aneurysm were
        enrolled from 2005 to 2009. Patients'' demographics, including Hunt and Hess
        grade, Fisher scale, and location and size of aneurysms, were collected. Complications
        such as rupture of aneurysm, thromboembolic events, ventriculostomy associated
        or systemic hemorrhages were recorded. Additionally, a 90 day outcome measurement
        was obtained using the Glasgow Outcome Scale. Results 22 patients with a mean
        age of 50\u00b113 years underwent stent assisted coiling. A loading dose of
        clopidogrel 300\u2005mg and aspirin 325\u2005mg orally were given prior to
        stent placement. There was no intraoperative rupture of aneurysm, ventriculostomy
        associated hemorrhage or systemic hemorrhagic event. There were two episodes
        of stent thrombosis; one was an asymptomatic event which developed during
        the stent assisted coiling procedure and resolved spontaneously; the other
        was symptomatic which required intra-arterial administration of glycoprotein
        IIbIIIa receptor antagonist. There was no mortality and good outcome was observed
        in 82% of patients. Conclusion In our series of carefully selected patients,
        therapeutic dual antiplatelet loading prior to stent assisted coiling of ruptured
        wide necked intracranial aneurysm was not associated with increased bleeding
        complications. However, thromboembolic events remain the main challenge. Further
        study is required to confirm the safety of antiplatelet loading in stent assisted
        ruptured intracranial aneurysm coiling.", "venue": "Journal of NeuroInterventional

        and safety of short-contact administration of topical tretinoin on foot ulcers
        in patients with diabetes.\n\n\nDESIGN\nRandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
        trial.\n\n\nSETTING\nOutpatient clinic at a Veterans Affairs medical center.\n\n\nPATIENTS\nTwenty-four
        volunteers with diabetic foot ulcers but without evidence of peripheral arterial
        disease or infection.\n\n\nINTERVENTIONS\nPatients were randomized to 4 weeks
        of daily treatment with either topical 0.05% tretinoin solution (Retin-A)
        or placebo saline solution. Photographs and assessment of wound size and appearance
        were assessed every 2 weeks for a total of 16 weeks.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe
        proportion of ulcers that healed in each group and the degree of change in
        ulcer size.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-two patients, with a total of 24 foot ulcers,
        completed the study. At the end of 16 weeks, 2 (18%) of 11 ulcers in the control
        group and 6 (46%) of 13 ulcers in the tretinoin treatment group healed completely.
        Topical tretinoin therapy significantly decreased ulcer area and depth compared
        with placebo treatment over the 16 weeks of the study (P < .01 for surface
        area; P = .02 for depth). Adverse effects mainly consisted of mild pain at
        the ulcer site.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nShort-contact application of topical tretinoin
        improved the healing of foot ulcers in patients with diabetes. The tretinoin
        therapy was generally well tolerated, without serious local or systemic adverse
        effects.", "venue": "Archives of Dermatology", "year": 2005, "referenceCount":

        control in patients with chronic periodontitis and type 2 diabetes.", "abstract":
        "BACKGROUND\nPatients with diabetes have increased incidence and severity
        of periodontal disease not accounted for by differences in the subgingival
        microbial infection. Poor glycemic control has been consistently associated
        with periodontal disease severity. Also, recent evidence suggests that hyperglycemia
        may induce inflammatory cytokine production. Few studies, however, have examined
        local biochemical measures of periodontal inflammation in patients with type
        2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether glycemic control
        was related to gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of interleukin-1beta
        (IL-1beta).\n\n\nMETHODS\nGCF samples were collected from 45 patients with
        type 2 diabetes and untreated chronic periodontitis. Plaque index (PI), bleeding
        on probing (BOP), probing depth (PD), and attachment level (AL) were recorded
        at six sites per tooth. IL-1beta levels were determined from individual GCF
        samples by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA). Individual site and
        mean patient values were calculated. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were
        measured from anticoagulated whole blood using an automated affinity chromatography
        system. Serum glucose was also determined.\n\n\nRESULTS\nClinical periodontal
        measures (PD, AL, BOP) and measures of glycemic control (HbA1c, random glucose)
        were significantly correlated with GCF IL-1beta. Patients with greater than
        8% HbA1c had significantly higher mean GCF IL-1beta levels than patients with
        less than 8% HbA1c. In a multivariate model adjusting for age, gender, PD,
        AL, BOP, and PI, HbA1c and random glucose were independent predictors of high
        GCF IL-1beta.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPoor glycemic control is associated with elevated
        GCF IL-1beta. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that hyperglycemia
        contributes to an heightened inflammatory response, and suggests a mechanism
        to account for the association between poor glycemic control and periodontal

        In 15-30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients aberrant proliferation
        is a consequence of a juxtamembrane mutation in the FLT3 gene (FLT3-ITD) causing
        constitutive kinase activity. ABT-869 (a multi-targeted receptor tyrosine
        kinase inhibitor) inhibited the phosphorylation of FLT3, STAT5 and ERK, and
        Pim-1 expression in MV-4-11 and MOLM-13 cells (IC 50 ~ 1-10 nM) harboring
        the FLT3-ITD. ABT-869 inhibited the proliferation of these cells (IC 50 =
        4 and 6 nM, respectively) through the induction of apoptosis (increased sub
        G0/G1 phase, caspase activation and PARP cleavage), whereas cells harboring
        wt-FLT3 were less sensitive. In normal human blood spiked with AML cells,
        ABT-869 inhibited phosphorylation of FLT3 (IC 50 ~100 nM), STAT5 and ERK,
        and decreased Pim-1 expression. In methylcellulose-based colony-forming assays,
        ABT-869 had no significant effect up to 1,000 nM on normal hematopoietic progenitor
        cells; whereas in AML patient samples harboring both FLT3-ITD and wt-FLT3,

        "title": "Risk of Distal Embolization From tPA (Tissue-Type Plasminogen Activator)
        Administration Prior to Endovascular Stroke Treatment", "abstract": "Background
        and Purpose: In large artery occlusion stroke, both intravenous (IV) tPA (tissue-type
        plasminogen activator) and endovascular stroke treatment (EST) are standard-of-care.
        It is unknown how often tPA causes distal embolization, in which a procedurally
        accessible large artery occlusion is converted to a more distal and potentially
        inaccessible occlusion. Methods: We analyzed data from a decentralized stroke
        telemedicine program in an integrated healthcare delivery system covering
        21 hospitals, with 2 high-volume EST centers. We captured all cases sent for
        EST and examined the relationship between IV tPA administration and the rate
        of distal embolization, the rate of target recanalization (modified Treatment
        in Cerebral Infarction scale 2b/3), clinical improvement before EST, and short-term
        and long-term clinical outcomes. Results: Distal embolization before EST was
        quite common (63/314 [20.1%]) and occurred more often after IV tPA before
        EST (57/229 [24.9%]) than among those not receiving IV tPA (6/85 [7.1%]; P<0.001).
        Distal embolization was associated with an inability to attempt EST: after
        distal embolization, 26/63 (41.3%) could not have attempted EST because of
        the new clot location, while in cases without distal embolization, only 8/249
        (3.2%) were unable to have attempted EST (P<0.001). Among patients who received
        IV tPA, 13/242 (5.4%) had sufficient symptom improvement that a catheter angiogram
        was not performed; 6/342 (2.5%) had improvement to within 2 points of their
        baseline NIHSS. At catheter angiogram, 2/229 (0.9%) of patients who had received
        tPA had complete recanalization without distal embolization. Both IV tPA and
        EST recanalization were associated with improved long-term outcome. Conclusions:
        IV tPA administration before EST for large artery occlusion is associated
        with distal embolization, which in turn may reduce the chance that EST can
        be attempted and recanalization achieved. At the same time, some IV tPA-treated
        patients show symptomatic improvement and complete recanalization. Because
        IV tPA is associated with both distal embolization and improved long-term
        clinical outcome, there is a need for prospective clinical trials testing
        the net benefit or harm of IV tPA before EST.", "venue": "Stroke", "year":

        Large artery occlusion (LAO) in ischemic stroke requires recognition and triage
        to an endovascular stroke treatment center. Noninvasive LAO detection is needed
        to improve triage. Methods\u2014 Prospective study to test whether noninvasive
        cerebral oximetry can detect anterior circulation LAO in acute stroke. Interhemispheric
        &Dgr;BrSO2 in LAO was compared with controls. Results\u2014 In LAO stroke,
        mean interhemispheric &Dgr;BrSO2 was \u22128.3\u00b15.8% (n=19), compared
        with 0.4\u00b15.8% in small artery stroke (n=17), 0.4\u00b16.0% in hemorrhagic
        stroke (n=14), and 0.2\u00b17.5% in subjects without stroke (n=19) (P<0.001).
        Endovascular stroke treatment reduced the &Dgr;BrSO2 in most LAO subjects
        (16/19). Discrimination of LAO at a \u22123% &Dgr;BrSO2 cut had 84% sensitivity

        AND PURPOSE: MR imaging of moving patients can be challenging and motion correction
        techniques have been proposed though some have associated new artifacts. The
        objective of this study was to semiquantitatively compare brain MR images
        of moving patients obtained at 1.5T by using partially radial and rectilinear
        acquisition techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FLAIR, T2-, T1-, and contrast-enhanced
        T1-weighted image sets of 25 patients (14\u201394 years) obtained by using
        BLADE (like PROPELLER, a partially radial acquisition) and rectilinear techniques
        in the same imaging session were compared by 2 neuroradiologists in terms
        of extent of the motion artifact, image quality, and lesion visibility. ICC
        between opinions of the evaluators was calculated. RESULTS: Of the total of
        70 image sets, the motion artifact was small in the partially radial images
        in 43 and in the rectilinear images in 13, and the opinions of the evaluators
        were discordant in the remaining 14 sets (ICC = 0.63, P < .05). The quality
        of partially radial images was higher for 36 sets versus 9 rectilinear sets,
        with disagreement between the 2 evaluators in the remaining 25 (ICC = 0.15,
        P < .05). Pathologic lesions were better characterized on 37 sets of partially
        radial images versus 13 sets of rectilinear images, and opinions of the evaluators
        differed in 20 sets (ICC = 0.90, P < .05). The neuroradiologists deemed 4
        sets of rectilinear images nondiagnostic compared with only 1 set of radial
        images. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that our application of BLADE sequences
        reduces the extent of motion artifacts in brain images of moving patients,
        improving image quality and lesion characterization.", "venue": "American

        "Attention layers, as commonly used in transformers, form the backbone of
        modern deep learning, yet there is no mathematical description of their benefits
        and deficiencies as compared with other architectures. In this work we establish
        both positive and negative results on the representation power of attention
        layers, with a focus on intrinsic complexity parameters such as width, depth,
        and embedding dimension. On the positive side, we present a sparse averaging
        task, where recurrent networks and feedforward networks all have complexity
        scaling polynomially in the input size, whereas transformers scale merely
        logarithmically in the input size; furthermore, we use the same construction
        to show the necessity and role of a large embedding dimension in a transformer.
        On the negative side, we present a triple detection task, where attention
        layers in turn have complexity scaling linearly in the input size; as this
        scenario seems rare in practice, we also present natural variants that can
        be efficiently solved by attention layers. The proof techniques emphasize
        the value of communication complexity in the analysis of transformers and
        related models, and the role of sparse averaging as a prototypical attention
        task, which even finds use in the analysis of triple detection.", "venue":

        Intersections of Halfspaces with Gaussian Marginals", "abstract": "We consider
        the well-studied problem of learning intersections of halfspaces under the
        Gaussian distribution in the challenging \\emph{agnostic learning} model.
        Recent work of Diakonikolas et al. (2021) shows that any Statistical Query
        (SQ) algorithm for agnostically learning the class of intersections of $k$
        halfspaces over $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to constant excess error either must make
        queries of tolerance at most $n^{-\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{\\log k})}$ or must
        make $2^{n^{\\Omega(1)}}$ queries. We strengthen this result by improving
        the tolerance requirement to $n^{-\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\log k)}$. This lower
        bound is essentially best possible since an SQ algorithm of Klivans et al.
        (2008) agnostically learns this class to any constant excess error using $n^{O(\\log
        k)}$ queries of tolerance $n^{-O(\\log k)}$. We prove two variants of our
        lower bound, each of which combines ingredients from Diakonikolas et al. (2021)

        "title": "Masked prediction tasks: a parameter identifiability view", "abstract":
        "The vast majority of work in self-supervised learning, both theoretical and
        empirical (though mostly the latter), have largely focused on recovering good
        features for downstream tasks, with the definition of\"good\"often being intricately
        tied to the downstream task itself. This lens is undoubtedly very interesting,
        but suffers from the problem that there isn''t a\"canonical\"set of downstream
        tasks to focus on -- in practice, this problem is usually resolved by competing
        on the benchmark dataset du jour. In this paper, we present an alternative
        lens: one of parameter identifiability. More precisely, we consider data coming
        from a parametric probabilistic model, and train a self-supervised learning
        predictor with a suitably chosen parametric form. Then, we ask whether we
        can read off the ground truth parameters of the probabilistic model from the
        optimal predictor. We focus on the widely used self-supervised learning method
        of predicting masked tokens, which is popular for both natural languages and
        visual data. While incarnations of this approach have already been successfully
        used for simpler probabilistic models (e.g. learning fully-observed undirected
        graphical models), we focus instead on latent-variable models capturing sequential
        structures -- namely Hidden Markov Models with both discrete and conditionally
        Gaussian observations. We show that there is a rich landscape of possibilities,
        out of which some prediction tasks yield identifiability, while others do
        not. Our results, borne of a theoretical grounding of self-supervised learning,
        could thus potentially beneficially inform practice. Moreover, we uncover
        close connections with uniqueness of tensor rank decompositions -- a widely
        used tool in studying identifiability through the lens of the method of moments.",

        "title": "Statistical-Computational Trade-offs in Tensor PCA and Related Problems
        via Communication Complexity", "abstract": "Tensor PCA is a stylized statistical
        inference problem introduced by Montanari and Richard to study the computational
        difficulty of estimating an unknown parameter from higher-order moment tensors.
        Unlike its matrix counterpart, Tensor PCA exhibits a statistical-computational
        gap, i.e., a sample size regime where the problem is information-theoretically
        solvable but conjectured to be computationally hard. This paper derives computational
        lower bounds on the run-time of memory bounded algorithms for Tensor PCA using
        communication complexity. These lower bounds specify a trade-off among the
        number of passes through the data sample, the sample size, and the memory
        required by any algorithm that successfully solves Tensor PCA. While the lower
        bounds do not rule out polynomial-time algorithms, they do imply that many
        commonly-used algorithms, such as gradient descent and power method, must
        have a higher iteration count when the sample size is not large enough. Similar
        lower bounds are obtained for Non-Gaussian Component Analysis, a family of
        statistical estimation problems in which low-order moment tensors carry no
        information about the unknown parameter. Finally, stronger lower bounds are
        obtained for an asymmetric variant of Tensor PCA and related statistical estimation
        problems. These results explain why many estimators for these problems use
        a memory state that is significantly larger than the effective dimensionality
        of the parameter of interest.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

        bounds. The main contribution is an analysis showing that the original network

        to handle modern computation graphs featuring convolutional layers, fully-connected

        "title": "A Gradual, Semi-Discrete Approach to Generative Network Training
        via Explicit Wasserstein Minimization", "abstract": "This paper provides a
        simple procedure to fit generative networks to target distributions, with
        the goal of a small Wasserstein distance (or other optimal transport costs).
        The approach is based on two principles: (a) if the source randomness of the
        network is a continuous distribution (the \"semi-discrete\" setting), then
        the Wasserstein distance is realized by a deterministic optimal transport
        mapping; (b) given an optimal transport mapping between a generator network
        and a target distribution, the Wasserstein distance may be decreased via a
        regression between the generated data and the mapped target points. The procedure
        here therefore alternates these two steps, forming an optimal transport and
        regressing against it, gradually adjusting the generator network towards the
        target distribution. Mathematically, this approach is shown to minimize the
        Wasserstein distance to both the empirical target distribution, and also its
        underlying population counterpart. Empirically, good performance is demonstrated
        on the training and testing sets of the MNIST and Thin-8 data. The paper closes
        with a discussion of the unsuitability of the Wasserstein distance for certain

        Euclidean space Rd is the d-dimensional vector space over the real numbers
        R where we have the familiar notions of distances and angles from classical
        plane geometry. The space Rd is comprised of vectors (or points), which can
        be added (z := x + y for x,y \u2208 Rd) and scaled by real numbers (z := cx
        for c \u2208 R and x \u2208 Rd) to obtain other vectors in Rd. Every vector
        x \u2208 Rd has a (Euclidean) length (or norm; also called the l2 norm), which
        is denoted by \u2016x\u20162. The length of the scaled vector cx for c \u2208
        R and x \u2208 Rd is \u2016cx\u20162 = |c|\u2016x\u20162. Vectors with length
        one are called unit vectors, and there is a unique vector of length zero which
        is the zero vector (or origin) 0. The Euclidean norm comes from the inner
        product (or dot product) \u3008x,y\u3009 between vectors x,y \u2208 Rd, which
        is defined to be the product of (i) the length of x, (ii) the length of y,
        and (iii) the cosine of the angle between x and y. (Sometimes we will also
        write the inner product as x>y.) Since the cosine of the angle between x and
        itself is 1, we have \u3008x,x\u3009 = \u2016x\u20162. We say x and y are
        orthogonal if \u3008x,y\u3009 = 0. Using arguments from plane geometry, it
        can be shown that the inner product is symmetric (\u3008x,y\u3009 = \u3008y,x\u3009)

        \u3008y, z\u3009). The distance dist(x,y) between vectors x and y is measured
        by the Euclidean norm of their difference, \u2016x\u2212y\u20162. This is
        a metric (called the Euclidean metric or l2 metric): for all x,y, z \u2208
        Rd: \u2022 \u2016x\u2212 y\u20162 \u2265 0, and \u2016x\u2212 y\u20162 = 0

        among the top-6 estimates 91.9% of the time. The CNN model also successfully
        identifies space groups for 12 out of 15 experimental PDFs. Interesting aspects
        of the failed estimates are discussed, which indicate that the CNN is failing
        in similar ways as conventional indexing algorithms applied to conventional
        powder diffraction data. This preliminary success of the CNN model shows the
        possibility of model-independent assessment of PDF data on a wide class of
        materials.", "venue": "Acta Crystallographica Section A: Foundations and Advances",

        "title": "Subregional Nowcasts of Seasonal Influenza Using Search Trends",
        "abstract": "Background Limiting the adverse effects of seasonal influenza
        outbreaks at state or city level requires close monitoring of localized outbreaks
        and reliable forecasts of their progression. Whereas forecasting models for
        influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) are becoming increasingly available,
        their applicability to localized outbreaks is limited by the nonavailability
        of real-time observations of the current outbreak state at local scales. Surveillance
        data collected by various health departments are widely accepted as the reference
        standard for estimating the state of outbreaks, and in the absence of surveillance
        data, nowcast proxies built using Web-based activities such as search engine
        queries, tweets, and access of health-related webpages can be useful. Nowcast
        estimates of state and municipal ILI were previously published by Google Flu
        Trends (GFT); however, validations of these estimates were seldom reported.
        Objective The aim of this study was to develop and validate models to nowcast
        ILI at subregional geographic scales. Methods We built nowcast models based
        on autoregressive (autoregressive integrated moving average; ARIMA) and supervised
        regression methods (Random forests) at the US state level using regional weighted
        ILI and Web-based search activity derived from Google''s Extended Trends application
        programming interface. We validated the performance of these methods using
        actual surveillance data for the 50 states across six seasons. We also built
        state-level nowcast models using state-level estimates of ILI and compared
        the accuracy of these estimates with the estimates of the regional models
        extrapolated to the state level and with the nowcast estimates published by
        GFT. Results Models built using regional ILI extrapolated to state level had
        a median correlation of 0.84 (interquartile range: 0.74-0.91) and a median
        root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.01 (IQR: 0.74-1.50), with noticeable variability
        across seasons and by state population size. Model forms that hypothesize
        the availability of timely state-level surveillance data show significantly
        lower errors of 0.83 (0.55-0.23). Compared with GFT, the latter model forms
        have lower errors but also lower correlation. Conclusions These results suggest
        that the proposed methods may be an alternative to the discontinued GFT and
        that further improvements in the quality of subregional nowcasts may require
        increased access to more finely resolved surveillance data.", "venue": "Journal

        problem of classification in the presence of unknown class-conditional label
        noise in which the labels observed by the learner have been corrupted with
        some unknown class dependent probability. In order to obtain finite sample
        rates, previous approaches to classification with unknown class-conditional
        label noise have required that the regression function is close to its extrema
        on sets of large measure. We shall consider this problem in the setting of
        non-compact metric spaces, where the regression function need not attain its
        extrema. In this setting we determine the minimax optimal learning rates (up
        to logarithmic factors). The rate displays interesting threshold behaviour:
        When the regression function approaches its extrema at a sufficient rate,
        the optimal learning rates are of the same order as those obtained in the
        label-noise free setting. If the regression function approaches its extrema
        more gradually then classification performance necessarily degrades. In addition,
        we present an adaptive algorithm which attains these rates without prior knowledge
        of either the distributional parameters or the local density. This identifies
        for the first time a scenario in which finite sample rates are achievable
        in the label noise setting, but they differ from the optimal rates without
        label noise.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount": 31, "citationCount":

        their desired context-aware behavior (situation and associated action) in
        situ, without writing any code, by demonstrating it to a CAPpella and by annotating
        the relevant portions of the demonstration. Using a meeting and medicine-taking
        scenario, we illustrate how a user can demonstrate different behaviors to
        a CAPpella. We describe a CAPpella''s underlying system to explain how it

        us a welcome addition to the string trio literature, a moderately difficult
        work in an accessible contemporary idiom. The composer states: \"For me, writing
        for strings is a very immediate and intense form of communication. In the
        String Trio I also sought to celebrate modern string virtuosity within the
        context of a constantly varying dialogue of three strong and equal partners
        in chamber music.\" In three movements of differing character, the entire
        work is cyclic, generated by the same musical material. Its duration is about
        16 minutes. Moderately difficult, it is well written for the instruments,
        in a fine, clear edition the parts are easy to read and well-planned for page
        turns, and a score is included. [P.G.] ; duce these classics to a recognizable
        and faithful facsimile. There is a minimum of editing in each part and great
        demands are made on each player in terms of range and doublestopped parts.
        There was no score included with the parts. lV.E.]", "venue": "The SAGE International

        "Abstract \u2014The paper introduces a new method of feature selection through
        the function model of game fusion. We use the traditional three steps of accomplishing
        feature selection by the fusion model: Firstly, fusion model can preprocess
        the input information, classify the information into conflict data, redundant
        data and complementary data, and filter the conflict data. Then, it transmits
        the preprocessed data to the modules of the information center. Finally, fusion
        model achieves the optimal situation through the fusion algorithm. We discover
        the complexity of these three steps will be high when the size of features
        is huge. Therefore, we draw on the experience of feature division and reduce
        the size of strategy set from power set of features to the features set. Keywords-game
        theory; information fusion; feature selection I. I NTRODUCTION Information
        fusion which is also named as data fusion is originated from sonar signal
        processing system of the United States Department of Defense in 1973. Information
        fusion merges the information from disparate sources which are always gathered
        by multi-sensor system. The two critical elements of information fusion method
        are fusion model and fusion algorithm. There are plenty of methods accomplishing
        the information fusion in different field. Information fusion based on game
        theory is a hot topic at present. Most of the methods based on game theory
        use the function model of game fusion which is proposed by Wang in [1], but
        the fusion algorithms are different. For example, Xiao takes the Bayesian
        network as the fusion algorithm[2]. Yin uses the Markov game theory and introduces
        a thought of using agent[3]. Xu uses Nash equilibrium which is a concept of
        economy[4]. Wei tries the technique of hotpot [5] and Guo introduces the way
        of game fusion using multi intelligent agents[6]. Feature selection is one
        of the applications can accomplish through information fusion based on game
        theory. We can achieve the goals of feature selection through the game fusion
        model of [1] and the fusion algorithm of [4], but this attempt has a huge
        size of complexity. Fu introduces a new method of feature selection of game
        theory in [7]. Although the method of Fu has many limitations, we use the
        thought of this new method in game fusion model and achieve good effect finally.

        "title": "Linear algebra review", "abstract": "1 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
        Definition 1. A d \u00d7 d matrix M has eigenvalue \u03bb if there is a d-dimensional
        vector u = 0 for which Mu = \u03bbu. This u is the eigenvector corresponding
        to \u03bb. In other words, the linear transformation M maps vector u into
        the same direction. It is interesting that any linear transformation necessarily
        has directional fixed points of this kind. The following chain of implications
        helps in understanding this: \u03bb is an eigenvalue of M \u21d4 there exists
        u = 0 with Mu = \u03bbu \u21d4 there exists u = 0 with (M \u2212 \u03bbI)u
        = 0 \u21d4 (M \u2212 \u03bbI) is singular (that is, not invertible) \u21d4
        det(M \u2212 \u03bbI) = 0. Now, det(M \u2212 \u03bbI) is a polynomial of degree
        d in \u03bb. As such it has d roots (although some of them might be complex).
        This explains the existence of eigenvalues. A case of great interest is when
        M is real-valued and symmetric, because then the eigenvalues are real. The
        spectral decomposition recasts a matrix in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
        This representation turns out to be enormously useful. Theorem 3. Let M be
        a real symmetric d \u00d7 d matrix with eigenvalues \u03bb", "venue": "",

        the fundamental concepts of machine learning such as feature assessment, unsupervised

        approaches relevant to the understanding of governance in tourism policy-making.
        It also endeavours to be a tool to relate to these concepts, approaches and
        theories and elaborate a theoretical framework for analysing the policy-making
        processes in tourism. An attempt has been made in this research to realise
        a theoretical framework to compare governance apparatuses in tourism policy
        making. Through an in-depth literature review, the key concepts and issues
        identified and a ''Definitional Model of Governance'' and ''Principles of
        Enquiry'' were established in order to assist the future case studies of tourism
        policy making. The models considered in this enquiry were three basic forms
        of governance: hierarchies, markets, and networks in the policy process and
        their influence on it. The enquiry listed a number of questions that corresponded
        to the key processes in policy-making and implementation.", "venue": "", "year":

        splicing requires snRNPs and associated splicing factors to excise conserved
        intronic sequences, with a minimum intron length required for efficient splicing.
        Non-canonical splicing\u2013intron excision without the spliceosome\u2013has
        been documented; most notably, some tRNAs and the XBP1 mRNA contain short
        introns that are not removed by the spliceosome. There have been some efforts
        to identify additional short introns, but little is known about how many short
        introns are processed from mRNAs. Here, we report an approach to identify
        RNA short introns from RNA-Seq data, discriminating against small genomic
        deletions. We identify hundreds of short introns conserved among multiple
        human cell lines. These short introns are often alternatively spliced and
        are found in a variety of RNAs\u2013both mRNAs and lncRNAs. Short intron splicing
        efficiency is increased by secondary structure, and we detect both canonical
        and non-canonical short introns. In many cases, splicing of these short introns
        from mRNAs is predicted to alter the reading frame and change protein output.
        Our findings imply that standard gene prediction models which often assume
        a lower limit for intron size fail to predict short introns effectively. We
        conclude that short introns are abundant in the human transcriptome, and short
        intron splicing represents an added layer to mRNA regulation.", "venue": "PLoS

        element of virtually all kernel methods for nonparametric regression problems.
        A critical factor in the effectiveness of a given kernel method is the type
        of regularization that is employed. This article compares and contrasts members
        from a general class of regularization techniques, which notably includes
        ridge regression and principal component regression. We first derive risk
        bounds for these techniques that match the minimax rates in several settings,
        using recent large deviations machinery and a natural bias-variance decomposition.
        We then show that certain regularization techniques are more adaptable than
        others to favorable regularity properties that the true regression function
        may possess. This, in particular, demonstrates a striking difference between
        kernel ridge regression and kernel principal component regression.", "venue":
