        "abstract": "Purpose Recent studies have demonstrated that hypertension (HTN)
        is associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in treated hypertensive
        patients. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between
        newly diagnosed essential HTN and NAFLD in untreated hypertensive patients.
        Patients and methods A consecutive series of 240 subjects (143 hypertensives
        and 97 normotensives), aged 30\u201380 years, without diabetes mellitus were
        enrolled in the study. Subjects with 24-hour systolic blood pressure (SBP)
        values \u2265130 mmHg and/or diastolic BP values \u226580 mmHg were defined
        as hypertensives. NAFLD was defined as the presence of liver hyperechogenicity
        on ultrasound. Results Body mass index (P=0.002) and essential HTN (P=0.016)
        were independently associated with NAFLD in the multivariate logistic regression
        model. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis revealed that morning SBP (P=0.044)
        was independently associated with NAFLD. Conclusion Untreated, newly diagnosed
        essential HTN is independently associated with NAFLD. Ambulatory BP monitoring
        could be used for the diagnosis of essential HTN in patients with NAFLD.",

        IgG antibodies in adult multitransfused beta-thalassemic patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe
        studied 182 adult beta-thalassemic patients and 209 controls matched for age
        and sex from the same geographic area, at the same time. Anti-HAV IgG antibodies,
        viral markers of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
        were evaluated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAnti-HAV IgG antibodies were detected more frequently
        in thalassemic patients (133/182; 73.1%) than in healthy controls (38/209;
        18.2%, P < 0.0005). When we retrospectively evaluated the prevalence of anti-HAV
        IgG antibodies in 176/182 (96.7%) thalassemic patients, whose medical history
        was available for the previous ten years, it was found that 83 (47.2%) of
        them were continuously anti-HAV IgG positive, 16 (9.1%) acquired anti-HAV
        IgG antibody during the previous ten years, 49 (27.8%) presented anti-HAV
        positivity intermittently and 28 (15.9%) were anti-HAV negative continuously.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nMultitransfused
        adult beta-thalassemic patients present higher frequency of anti-HAV IgG antibodies
        than normal population of the same geographic area. This difference is difficult
        to explain, but it can be attributed to the higher vulnerability of thalassemics
        to HAV infection and to passive transfer of anti-HAV antibodies by blood transfusions.",

        to the process of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The aim of this study
        was to evaluate the lipaemic profile in patients with chronic HCV infection,
        and to identify any association between serum lipid levels and viral load,
        HCV genotype or liver histology. Total cholesterol (TC), high\u2010density
        lipoprotein\u2010cholesterol (HDL\u2010C), low\u2010density lipoprotein\u2010cholesterol
        (LDL\u2010C) and triglycerides (TG) were measured in the sera of 155 patients
        with chronic HCV infection and 138 normal subjects, matched for age and sex.
        Viral parameters and liver histology were evaluated in HCV\u2010infected patients.
        Serum TC (P\u2003<\u20030.0005), HDL\u2010C (P\u2003<\u20030.0005) and LDL\u2010C
        (P\u2003<\u20030.0005) were lower in chronic hepatitis C patients compared
        with controls. Grading score was positively correlated with TC and LDL\u2010C.
        Patients with HCV genotype 3a had significantly lower levels of TC, HDL\u2010C,
        LDL\u2010C, higher viral load and higher frequency of hepatic steatosis than
        those with other genotypes. Logistic regression analysis identified genotype
        3a (OR, 6.96; 95% CI, 2.17\u201322.32, P\u2003=\u20030.0011) as the only significant
        predictive variable associated with low serum cholesterol concentration. HCV
        infection is associated with clinically significant lower cholesterol levels
        (TC, LDL and HDL) when compared with those of normal subjects. This finding
        is more pronounced in patients infected with HCV genotype 3a. Further studies
        are necessary to define the pathophysiology of the relationship between lipid

        C virus (HCV) infection. Methods Thirty-five adult HCV infected, multi-transfused,
        beta-thalassaemia patients (beta-HCV patients), 63 otherwise normal patients
        with chronic HCV infection (HCV patients) and 54 beta-thalassaemia patients
        without chronic viral hepatitis (beta patients) were studied. Total cholesterol,
        high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
        (LDL-C), triglycerides, viral markers and liver histology were evaluated.
        Results Serum total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C were found at significantly
        lower levels in beta-HCV and beta patients than in HCV patients. Triglyceride
        levels were significantly lower in the HCV group compared with the beta group.
        Nine (25.7%) of the 35 beta-HCV patients had mild hepatic steatosis. Thirteen
        (23.6%) of 55 HCV patients presented mild and 4/55 (7.3%) moderate hepatic
        steatosis. None of the beta group presented steatosis. When we compared beta-HCV
        and HCV patients with steatosis, we found that beta-HCV patients had a lower
        degree of steatosis (11.1\u00b17% vs 22.9\u00b117.2%, P=0.021). Multivariate
        logistic regression analysis showed that the only independent predictor associated

        levels (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL) and similar frequency but a lower degree
        of hepatic steatosis. This difference in the degree of steatosis is most likely
        due to the higher prevalence of genotype 3a in the non-beta-thalassaemia group.",

        have a greater risk for premature morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular
        disease than the general population: cardiovascular disease accounts for 75%
        of deaths in this population group. We examined whether or not the association
        of clinical cardiovascular risk factors (RF) with both microalbuminuria (MA)
        and diabetic retinopathy (DR) constitutes reliable evidence for the existence
        of asymptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD), as assessed by positive myocardial
        thallium scintiscan using the SPECT method (Tl-scan) in patients with DM2.
        The study included 76 individuals with DM2 (54 men and 22 women, aged 46-70
        years), with a negative history for infarction and negative clinical or ECG
        findings of CAD. In all patients, 3 overnight (11 pm - 7 am) urine collections
        were made for evaluation of MA. Fundoscopy after dilatation and a Tl-scan
        (reference method) were also carried out. In addition, blood pressure and
        waist/hip ratio were measured and smoking habits were recorded. In the 35
        patients with a positive Tl-scan (46%) a higher (p<0.001) incidence of MA,
        DR, hypertension, smoking and higher waist/hip ratio were detected. Of the
        16 patients with concurrent presence of MA and DR, 15 had a positive Tl-scan
        (94%), whereas the Tl-scan was negative in 30/36 (83%) patients with absence
        of both MA and DR. One or no cardiovascular RF in the absence of MA and DR
        increased the prediction of a negative Tl-scan to 100% (NPV: 1.00). Based
        only on history, fundoscopy and MA testing, and without resorting to expensive
        and laborious testing procedures, it is possible to safely distinguish patients
        with type 2 diabetes, who require no further investigations for asymptomatic
        CAD.", "venue": "HORMONES", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 30, "citationCount":

        "abstract": "Introduction: The aim of the study was to analyze the published
        evidence for the use of fallopian tube brush cytology for the early detection
        of extrauterine serous gynecological cancer. Methods: We systematically searched
        the literature and, additionally, cross-checked on the bibliographies of selected
        articles. The inclusion criteria involved studies assessing the utility of
        fallopian tube brush cytology and its applications in the diagnosis, screening,
        or follow-up of extrauterine serous gynecological cancer. Results: The search
        strategy resulted in 21 abstracts or full-text articles, 5 of which met the
        inclusion criteria. The year of publication ranged from 2016 to 2022, and
        a total of 193 fallopian tube samples were investigated. Cytobrush, Tubebrush\u00a9,
        and Cytuity\u2122 were used to obtain salpingeal samples for liquid-based
        cytology evaluation. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that, at present,
        there is a lack of satisfying evidence-based data in the literature which
        would support the implementation of fallopian tube brush cytology as an adjunctive
        tool for early detection of extrauterine serous gynecological cancer. Thus,
        we believe that there is need for well-designed clinical studies to assess
        the effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy of the method as well as to validate
        the cytological criteria for the diagnosis and prediction of gynecological
        malignancies.", "venue": "Acta Cytologica", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

        and poor performance status were enrolled in this retrospective, observational,
        single-centre study, carried out between December 2018 and November 2020.
        The patient''s renal function was regularly assessed with serum creatinine

        The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 24-month outcomes of ureteroureterostomy
        combined with unilateral nephrostomy following radical cystectomy in patients
        with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (BC). Materials and methods This single-center
        study with prospectively collected data with retrospective data analysis was
        carried out between December 2018 and November 2021 and enrolled 36 patients,
        who underwent radical cystectomy combined with ureteroureterostomy and unilateral

        creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and postoperative
        complications, endoscopic, ultrasound, and other radiological study findings
        were evaluated. The follow-up of the patients was carried out over a period
        of 24 months. Results After completion of the 24-month follow-up, the renal
        function proved to be slightly improved (mean serum creatinine and eGFR values
        of 1.38\u00b10.72 mg/dL and 55.9\u00b121.87 mL/min) compared to the first-year
        results (1.41\u00b10.54 mg/dL and 52.10\u00b119.64 mL/min). However, this
        improvement is statistically not significant (p=0.44, p=0.30). The 24-month
        follow-up imaging findings remained stable in 97.22% of patients compared
        to the first-year results, with preservation of bilateral ureteric dilatation
        and grade 1 dilatation of the non-drained kidney. No case of acute pyelonephritis
        was recorded after the completion of the second year of follow-up, in comparison
        to the eight patients (22.22%) of the 12-month follow-up, who suffered acute
        pyelonephritis. After completing of the 24-month follow-up, one patient was
        excluded from further analysis, due to the placement of a second permanent
        percutaneous nephrostomy in the non-drained kidney, due to ureteroureterostomy
        stenosis with consecutive hydronephrosis in the contralateral kidney and acute
        renal failure. No case of anastomotic leak was observed. Conclusions The function
        of the ureteroureterostomy combined with unilateral nephrostomy is proven
        to be a safe method of urinary diversion (UD) at 24 months, with minimal and
        easily manageable complications. Only one case of stenosis of the ureteroureterostomy
        with consecutive acute renal failure due to hydronephrosis in the non-drained
        kidney was observed. The renal function remained stable.", "venue": "Cureus",

        RAS mutated patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.", "abstract": "e15605
        Background: Trifluridine-tipiracil (FTD/TPI) plus bevacizumab has shown efficacy
        inrefractory metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC); however, evidence supporting
        the role of this combination in Ras mutated population, is limited. In this
        phase II study, we investigated the efficacy and safety profiles of FTD/TPI
        in mCRC according to KRAS status. Methods: Eligible patients were mCRC refractory
        or intolerant to all standard therapies including fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan
        and oxaliplatin. Patients received 4-week cycles of treatment with FTD/TPI
        (35 mg/m2, twice daily, days 1-5 and 8-12) and bevacizumab (5 mg/kg, days
        1 and 15). Clinicopathological characteristics, overall response rate (ORR),
        disease control rate (DCR), PFS, and safety data were collected and analyzed.
        Results: Forty-two patients were enrolled. Median age was 67 years (range
        41\u201379 years), 44% were male, 100% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
        Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0\u20131, 85% were KRAS and 15% NRAS
        mutant, and 75% underwent primary tumor resection; 68% of patients had liver
        metastases, 49% had lung metastases, and 18% had peritoneal carcinomatosis.
        The median number of previous treatment lines was 2 (range1\u20133), and 85%
        of patients received at least one previous anti-angiogenic agent. DCR was
        57.1% (90% CI, 44.6 %-69.3%, P = 0.0690), respectively. The median progression-free
        survival (PFS) was 4.6 months. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse event
        was neutropenia (54%), and anemia (16%); 32% of patients required either dose
        delays or dose reductions due to toxicity. No treatment-related deaths occurred.
        Conclusions: FTD/TPI is an important therapeutic resource in refractory RAS
        mutated metastatic colorectal cancer that combines manageability and safety.",

        "title": "The application of a multigene NGS assay in homologous recombination
        deficiency tracking.", "abstract": "e15169 Background: Several tumor types
        have been efficiently treated with PARP inhibitors, a class of proteins involved
        in DNA repair pathway, which are approved for the treatment of ovarian, breast,
        prostate, and pancreatic cancer. The BRCA1/2 genes are essential for homologous
        recombination, and tumors which carry this type of mutations appear to have
        a defective homologous recombination pathway as a result of the loss of the
        second non mutated allele in the tumor. However, both epigenetic changes and
        mutations in many other genes involved in the HR pathway, including Fanconi
        anemia genes and the \u0391RID1A, ATM, ATRX, BAP1, BARD1, BLM, BRIP1, CHEK1/2,
        MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD50, RAD51, WRN may be responsible for the HRD phenomenon.
        In addition to mutational status, useful for the detection of the patients
        that would benefit from PARPi treatment could be the presence of certain genomic
        scars in the tumor, such as the loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Methods: In
        this study 406 samples from patients with various tumor types were analyzed
        using a targeted NGS assay for the analysis of 513 genes associated with targeted
        and immuno-oncology therapies. This assay detects relevant SNVs, indels, CNVs,
        gene fusions, splice variants in addition to TMB and MSI simultaneously. It
        also measures genomic instability using sample-level LOH in addition to the
        analysis for 31 HR related gene alterations. Moreover, the %gLOH was also
        calculated by the OncoScan\u2122 CNV Assay in 25 samples in order to compare
        the results obtained by these two methodologies. Results: An HR gene mutation
        was detected in 20.93% of the tumors analyzed, with BRCA1/2 genes being the
        most prevalent HR altered genes detected in 5.17% of the tumors. The majority
        of the non BRCA1/2 HR mutations were in ARID1A (4.18%), ATRX (2.21%) and ATM
        (1.97%) genes. The %gLOH was highly correlated with the presence of mutations
        in the BRCA1/2 genes since 76.19% (16/21) of the tumors harboring such alterations
        had a high %LOH value (p = 0.007). Additionally, the LOH status was highly
        correlated to the presence of TP53 mutations, while a negative correlation
        to KRAS mutations was observed. Furthermore, there was no association of %LOH
        and TMB value in our cohort. Lin''s Concordance Correlation Coefficient was
        0.93 for the 25 evaluable samples examined simultaneously by both assays,
        indicating an almost perfect agreement. Conclusions: A high rate of HR mutations
        was detected in ovarian, breast and prostate which is consistent with the
        PARPi approval in these tumor types. The presence of BRCA1/2 mutations was
        highly associated with increased LOH value whereas it did not correlate to
        other HR mutations. Additionally, the pancancer presence of HR gene alterations
        indicates that the use of such genes as biomarkers of platinum and PARPi treatments
        should be evaluated in a wider range of tumor types. In conclusion the addition
        of analysis of the gLOH seems to be useful for the detection of additional
        patients eligible for PARPis.", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Oncology", "year":

        in Patients Referred for Hereditary Cancer Testing", "abstract": "Abstract
        Background/Aim: Germline copy number variation (CNV) is a type of genetic
        variant that predisposes significantly to inherited cancers. Today, next-generation
        sequencing (NGS) technologies have contributed to multi gene panel analysis
        in clinical practice. Materials and Methods: A total of 2,163 patients were
        screened for cancer susceptibility, using a solution-based capture method.
        A panel of 52 genes was used for targeted NGS. The capture-based approach
        enables computational analysis of CNVs from NGS data. We studied the performance
        of the CNV module of the commercial software suite SeqPilot (JSI Medical Systems)
        and of the non-commercial tool panelcn.MOPS. Additionally, we tested the performance
        of digital multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (digitalMLPA).
        Results: Pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P/LP) were identified in 464
        samples (21.5%). CNV accounts for 10.8% (50/464) of pathogenic variants, referring
        to deletion/duplication of one or more exons of a gene. In patients with breast
        and ovarian cancer, CNVs accounted for 10.2% and 6.8% of pathogenic variants,
        respectively. In colorectal cancer patients, CNV accounted for 28.6% of pathogenic/likely
        pathogenic variants. Conclusion: In silico CNV detection tools provide a viable
        and cost-effective method to identify CNVs from NGS experiments. CNVs constitute
        a substantial percentage of P/LP variants, since they represent up to one
        of every ten P/LP findings identified by NGS multigene analysis; therefore,
        their evaluation is highly recommended to improve the diagnostic yield of
        hereditary cancer analysis.", "venue": "Cancer Genomics & Proteomics", "year":

        immune-related factors are responsible for better treatment outcomes, and

        effect could be exploited in the neoadjuvant setting of BC and significantly
        enhance the effects of the already established clinical practice. Modern stereotactic
        irradiation techniques directed to the primary tumor and involved lymph nodes
        may prove important for the RT-NACT-IO combination. In this review, we provide
        an overview and critically discuss the biological rationale, clinical experience,
        and ongoing research underlying the interplay between neoadjuvant chemotherapy,
        anti-tumor immune response, and the emerging role of RT as a preoperative
        adjunct with immunological therapeutic implications in BC.", "venue": "International

        factors of survival and recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer patients undergoing
        radical surgery and HIPEC. Methods In a single Department of Surgical Oncology,
        Peritoneal Surface Malignancy Program, and over a 16-year period, from a total
        of 274 epithelial ovarian cancer patients, retrospectively, we identified
        152 patients undergoing complete (CC-0) or near-complete (CC-1) cytoreduction,
        including at least one colonic resection, and HIPEC. Results Mean age of patients
        was 58.8 years and CC-0 was possible in 72.4%. Rates of in-hospital mortality
        and major morbidity were 2.6% and 15.7%. Only 122 (80.3%) patients completed
        Adjuvant Systemic Chemotherapy (ASCH). Rates of metastatic Total Lymph Nodes
        (TLN), Para-Aortic and Pelvic Lymph Nodes (PAPLN) and Large Bowel Lymph Nodes
        (LBLN) were 58.7%, 58.5%, and 51.3%, respectively. Median, 5- and 10-year
        survival rates were 39 months, 43%, and 36.2%, respectively. The recurrence
        rate was 35.5%. On univariate analysis, CC-1, high Peritoneal Cancer Index
        (PCI), in-hospital morbidity, and no adjuvant chemotherapy were adverse factors
        for survival and recurrence. On multivariate analysis, negative survival indicators
        were the advanced age of patients, extensive peritoneal dissemination, low
        total number of TLN and no systemic PAPLN. Metastatic LBLN and segmental resection
        of the small bowel (SIR) were associated with a high risk for recurrence.
        Conclusion CC-O is feasible in most advanced ovarian cancer patients and HIPEC
        may confer a survival benefit. Radical bowel resection, with its entire mesocolon,
        may be necessary, as its lymph nodes often harbor metastases influencing disease
        recurrence and survival. The role of metastatic bowel lymph nodes has to be
        taken into account when assessing the impact of systemic lymphadenectomy in
        this group of patients.", "venue": "Cancer Control: Journal of the Moffitt

        "title": "Abstract P2-09-10: Different CNVs account for 10.4% of pathogenic
        variants in 1418 patients referred for hereditary breast cancer testing",
        "abstract": "\n Background: Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed
        cancer in women and about 10% of breast cancer cases are hereditary. BRCA1
        and BRCA2 are the genes most frequently associated with Hereditary Breast
        Cancer, although there are numerous other genes, such as PALB2, CHEK2 and
        ATM, that require to be considered as well. Germline Copy Number Variation
        (CNV) is one mutation type that is an important contributor to hereditary
        breast cancer. Nowadays, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has
        contributed to multi-gene panel analysis used in clinical practice. Methods:
        In total, 1418 individuals were tested for breast cancer predisposition, using
        a solution-based capture approach. Targeted NGS was performed with a panel
        of 36 genes. The capture-based approach allowed for computational analysis
        of CNVs from NGS data. Results: We investigate the performance of the CNV
        module of the commercial software suite SeqPilot (JSI Medical Systems) and
        the non-commercial tool panelcn.MOPS. Both algorithms are specifically developed
        for CNV analysis of sequencing data reporting 99-100% sensitivity and up to
        100% specificity for the prediction of CNVs up to the level of a single gene
        exon. All CNVs detected with these algorithms were then verified experimentally
        using the MLPA technique as an orthogonal assay. At least one pathogenic/likely
        pathogenic variant was identified in 289 samples (20.4%). CNVs accounted for
        10.4% (30/289), referring to the deletion of one or more exons of a gene.
        Interestingly, 50% of deletions were single exon and approximately 36% of
        CNVs were detected in genes other than BRCA1/2. In specific, of the 30 CNVs
        detected, 60% occurred in BRCA1, 3.3% in BRCA2, 20% in CHEK2, 6.7% in FANCA,
        6.7% in PMS2, and 3.3% in ATM. The majority of CNVs in BRCA1 were deletions
        of exons 19, 22, and 22-23 whereas deletions of exons 9-10 were the most common
        deletions in CHEK2. Detailed information of all CNVs detected is provided
        in Table 1.\n Conclusions: Our results suggest that CNV analysis should not
        be restricted to BRCA1/2 due to the significant proportion of CNVs (36%) in
        additional breast cancer predisposition genes. Furthermore, in silico CNV
        detection tools provide a cost-effective and feasible methodology for the
        identification of CNVs from NGS experiments. This outlines the clinical utility
        of comprehensive genetic testing that includes full sequencing and CNV analysis
        in hereditary breast cancer facilitating personalized management decisions
        for patients.\n Table 1.Pathogenic Copy Number Variations (CNVs) identified

        breast cancer patients", "abstract": "\n Background: Comprehensive tumor analysis
        by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is imperative for targeted and immunotherapy
        related biomarkers\u2019 analysis in metastatic breast cancer enabling personalization
        of cancer treatment in these patients. In parallel with targeted therapies,
        immunotherapies are also evolving, revolutionizing cancer therapy. Thus, biomarkers
        such as. Microsatellite Instability (MSI), and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB)
        are commonly employed in NGS analysis due to their correlation to Immune Checkpoint
        inhibitors treatment.Methods: In the present study, tumor molecular profile
        analysis was performed in 73 metastatic breast cancer patients using a broad
        NGS assay, which analyzes more than 500 unique cancer related genes and is
        able to detect relevant single nucleotide variations (SNVs), indels, copy
        number variations (CNVs) and gene fusions, in addition to TMB and MS) simultaneously.
        Results: An actionable alteration was detected in 79.45% of the patients.
        35.62% of them had at least one alteration with an on label treatment associated
        and 10.96% received information related to an off-label treatment (Tiers 1A.1
        and 2C.1 respectively). Additionally, 31.51% of the tumors harbored an alteration
        that could be used for clinical trial inclusion (Table 1). The most prevalent
        altered gene in these patients was the PIK3CA gene, with 27.40% mutation rate.
        Moreover, in 11 cases (15.07%) the mutation detected was in a gene involved
        in the Homologous recombination (HR) pathway, with evidence of response to
        PARP inhibitors. BRCA1/2 genes were as expected the most prominent HR mutated
        genes (5 out of 11 HR mutations), while the remaining HR mutations involved
        other HR genes (ATM, BLM, CHEK2, FANCM, RAD50). 24.66% of the tumors had a
        TMB value >10muts/MB and thus were eligible for ICI treatment. The addition
        of TMB to targeted biomarkers\u2019 analysis increased the number of patients
        with an on-label treatment recommendation by 8.22%. Conclusions: Tumor molecular
        profile analysis using NGS, in real world samples, is a first-tier method
        for metastatic breast cancer and provides important information for decision
        making in the treatment of such patients. Importantly, simultaneous analysis
        for targeted therapy and immunotherapy biomarkers could lead to better tumor
        characterization and offered actionable information in 9 out of 10 patients
        tested. However, appropriate interpretation of results from such analysis
        is essential for implementation in clinical practice and accurate refinement

        This non-interventional, multicenter, prospective study aimed to evaluate
        the real-world activity of trabectedin, and its impact on symptom burden and
        quality of life in patients with advanced soft tissue sarcoma (aSTS) treated
        in routine clinical settings in Greece. Patients with histologically confirmed
        aSTS newly initiated on trabectedin were enrolled. The primary endpoint was
        progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included
        PFS rate at 3 months, median PFS, objective response rate (ORR), disease control
        rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), and an assessment of the impact of treatment
        on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cancer-related symptom burden and
        symptom interference with function, as well as all-cause treatment discontinuation
        rate. A total of 64 eligible patients from 13 Greek centers were evaluated.
        Patients received a median of three trabectedin cycles per patient (interquartile
        range [IQR]: 2.0\u20136.0). Median PFS was 6.6 months with 67.9% and 51.2%
        of patients free from progression at 3 and 6 months, respectively. ORR was
        7.8% and DCR 21.9%. Median OS was 13.1 months. No significant changes from
        enrolment were noted in HRQoL scores. In total, 30 patients (46.9%) had at
        least one trabectedin-related adverse drug reaction (ADR) and 9 (14.1%) at
        least one serious ADR. The treatment discontinuation rate due to toxicity
        was 9.4%. These results suggest that trabectedin is an active treatment with
        clinically meaningful benefits in patients with aSTS with no new safety signals.",

        estimate the proportions of the different treatment regimens used per line
        of therapy, while progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)
        were the key secondary endpoints. A total of 154 patients were enrolled in
        the study, among whom, 40% were tested for BRCA mutations and 30% were found
        to be positive. Nearly 90% of patients underwent debulking surgery at diagnosis,
        with few operations being also recorded upon relapse. Platinum-based chemotherapy
        (CT) was predominantly used in the first line with half of patients also receiving
        angiogenesis inhibitor (AI), while non-platinum-based CT was preferred in

        Unselected Patients with Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma", "abstract": "Simple Summary
        Data on the prognostic and predictive value of germline cancer predisposing
        pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P/LPVs) in patients with pancreatic
        ductal adenocarcinoma is limited. This research was a study of germline testing
        of 62 cancer susceptibility genes in 549 unselected patients with pancreatic
        cancer. We reported a significant proportion of European patients with pancreatic
        cancer carrying P/LPVs in clinically significant genes, irrespectively of
        age, family history or disease stage. Importantly, P/LPVs were identified
        in pancreatic cancer-associated genes and in homologous recombination repair
        genes in 4.0% and 7.7% of patients, respectively. The presence of any P/LPVs
        was associated with improved overall survival univariately; however, it did
        not retain its independent prognostic significance in multivariate analysis.
        The presence of P/LPVs in homologous recombination repair genes did not predict
        benefit from platinum-based treatment. These results should be prospectively
        validated through universal genetic testing of patients with pancreatic cancer,
        taking into consideration the administration of newer treatments. Abstract
        Our aim was to determine the prevalence, prognostic and predictive role of
        germline pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P/LPVs) in cancer predisposing
        genes in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Germline testing
        of 62 cancer susceptibility genes was performed on unselected patients diagnosed
        from 02/2003 to 01/2020 with PDAC, treated at Hellenic Cooperative Oncology
        Group (HeCOG)-affiliated Centers. The main endpoints were prevalence of P/LPVs
        and overall survival (OS). P/LPVs in PDAC-associated and homologous recombination
        repair (HRR) genes were identified in 22 (4.0%) and 42 (7.7%) of 549 patients,
        respectively. P/LPVs were identified in 16 genes, including ATM (11, 2.0%)
        and BRCA2 (6, 1.1%), while 19 patients (3.5%) were heterozygotes for MUTYH
        P/LPVs and 9 (1.6%) carried the low-risk allele, CHEK2 p.(Ile157Thr). Patients
        carrying P/LPVs had improved OS compared to non-carriers (22.6 vs. 13.9 months,
        p = 0.006). In multivariate analysis, there was a trend for improved OS in
        P/LPV carriers (p = 0.063). The interaction term between platinum exposure
        and mutational status of HRR genes was not significant (p-value = 0.35). A
        significant proportion of patients with PDAC carries clinically relevant germline
        P/LPVs, irrespectively of age, family history or disease stage. The predictive
        role of these P/LPVs has yet to be defined. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:

        "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is probably the tumor type with the highest
        percentage of hereditary cases observed, irrespectively of selection criteria.
        A fourth to a fifth of unselected epithelial EOC patients carry pathogenic
        variants (PVs) in a number of genes, the majority of which encode for proteins
        involved in DNA repair pathways. BRCA1 and BRCA2 predisposing PVs were the
        first to be associated to ovarian cancer, with the advent in DNA sequencing
        technologies leading to the discovery and association of additional genes
        which compromise the homologous recombination (HR) pathway. In addition, PVs
        genes involved in mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, account for 10\u201315% of
        hereditary EOC. The identification of women with HR deficient ovarian cancers
        has significant clinical implications concerning chemotherapy regimen planning
        and development and use of targeted therapies as well. More specifically,
        in patients with BRCA1/2 PVs or HR deficiency maintenance treatment with poly(ADP-ribose)
        polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, either in the first line setting or in recurrent
        disease, improves the progression-free survival. But also patients with HR
        proficient tumors show a benefit. Therefore, genetic testing in ovarian cancer
        has a prognostic and predictive value. In this review, we discuss which ovarian
        cancer patients should be referred for genetic counseling and how to perform
        genetic testing. We also discuss the timing of genetic testing and its clinical
        relevance to BRCA status.", "venue": "Annals of Translational Medicine", "year":

        the effects ofnab-paclitaxel on clinical outcomes and quality of life of patients
        with metastatic breast cancer in Greece. The \u2018ABReast\u2019 study", "abstract":
        "Introduction: Nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab)-paclitaxel (nab-P) is approved
        for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who have
        failed first-line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom standard,
        anthracycline containing therapy is not indicated. Real-world evidence on
        the effectiveness of nab-P is sparse. From this perspective, this non-interventional
        study was designed to assess the impact of nab-P on the clinical outcomes
        and the quality of life of patients with MBC in the routine care of Greece.
        Materials and methods: This multicenter prospective study enrolled consented
        females with MBC initiated (\u22647 days prior to enrollment) on nab-P according
        to physicians decision. Clinicopathologic parameters and patient-reported
        outcomes [Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B)] were collected
        at approximately 9-week intervals during the first 12 months of study participation
        and approximately every 18 weeks thereafter, until the end of the study observation
        period (maximum 30 months). Results: Between April 2016 and October 2017,
        150 eligible patients (99.3% Caucasian) were enrolled in the study in 16 oncology
        centers. The patients\u2019 median age was 64.5 years (range: 30.7-84.0) and
        ECOG performance status was 0 in 66.4% and 1 in 26.2%. 45.3% of patients had
        \u22651 comorbidity (21.3% cardiovascular diseases). The median time elapsed
        since MBC diagnosis was 22.4 months, while 36.0% of patients were de novo
        metastatic. The distribution of hormone receptor (HR)/human epidermal growth
        factor receptor 2 (HER2) status was 74.6% HR+/HER2-, 11.9% HR-/HER2-, 11.2%
        HR+/HER2+, and 2.2% HR-/HER2+. Most commonly occurring metastatic sites were
        the bones (55.3%), lung (50.0%), and liver (40.0%). Prior taxane-based therapy
        was annotated in 40.0% of patients. Of the patients, 11.3% received nab-P
        as first, 36.0% as second, 23.3% as third, and 29.3% as fourth or further
        treatment line. A median of 6 cycles (range: 1-33) was administered; 42.7%
        of the patients completed >6 and 22.0% >8 cycles. Dose reductions were required
        for 26.0% of the patients, mainly due to toxicity. The objective response
        rate was 26.7% and the clinical benefit rate was 44.0%. After a median follow-up
        of 19.3 months, 92 patients had progressed and 57 had died (14 without progression).
        The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.2 months [95% confidence
        interval (CI): 5.2-7.3]. The 6- and 12-month PFS rates were 50.6% and 30.5%,
        respectively. The median overall survival was 21.1 months (95% CI: 17.2-not
        estimable). Liver [hazard ratio (HR): 1.81; 95% CI: 1.24-2.66] and lung (HR:
        1.53; 95% CI: 1.04-2.25) metastases were associated with a higher risk of
        progression or death. No statistically significant change in the patients\u2019
        baseline FACT-B total score (median: 93.0) was observed. The serious and non-serious
        adverse event (AE) incidence rates were 12.7% and 48.0%, respectively with
        a total of 37 grade \u22653 AEs (not including disease progression) reported.
        Conclusion: This study generated real-world evidence on the effectiveness
        of nab-paclitaxel; no new safety signals emerged. Citation Format: Anna Koumarianou,

        a high rate of loss-of-function variants in non-mucinous epithelial ovarian
        cancer patients", "abstract": "Non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosis
        is a stand-alone criterion for genetic testing referral, irrespectively of
        family history or age at diagnosis. Identification of at least BRCA1 & BRCA2
        mutations are fundamental for clinical decision making of ovarian cancer (OC)
        patients. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of damaging
        variants that can lead to defects of DNA repair by homologous recombination
        (HR) in an unselected cohort of epithelial non-mucinous OC patients. Identification
        of such variants can indicate ideal candidates for Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose)
        polymerase (PARP) inhibitor therapies.We therefore comprehensively analyzed
        genomic DNA from 578 epithelial non-mucinous OC patients for mutations in
        94 genes that are involved in DNA repair, implementing a commercially available
        gene-panel. Additionally, 121 tumors were collected from OC patients that
        had negative germline testing and were assessed for somatic BRCA1 & BRCA2
        mutations. Tumor cell content and necrosis were evaluated prior to tumor DNA
        extraction and were above 50% and below 20%, respectively.Overall, 25.4% (147/578)
        of the patients carried germline loss-of-function (LoF) variants, distributed
        in 18 genes namely, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C, ATM, FANCL, CHEK2, FANCM, BRIP1,
        TP53, NBN, FANCA, RECQL4, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, ERCC2 and SLX4. After BRCA1
        & BRCA2, which accounted for 72.1% of the total LoF variants, RAD51C LoF variants
        were the most frequent, accounting for 4.8% of the total LoF variants. Interestingly,
        the vast majority of LoF variants (136/147; 92.5%) involved homologous recombination/Fanconi
        anemia genes, detected in 23.5% of the total OC patients tested. Notably,
        4.5% of the pathogenic variants were detected in genes involved in Mismatch
        Repair (MMR) pathway. Subsequently, tumor analysis resulted in the identification
        of damaging BRCA1 & BRCA2 variants in 11.5% of the ovarian tumors tested.
        Variant allele frequencies varied from 9%-47%. Altogether, approximately one
        in three of OC patients in our cohort could be good candidates for therapies
        targeting defective mechanisms of DNA repair, including HR and MMR.Our study
        highlights the high prevalence of LoF variants in HR genes, when combining
        germline and tumor testing in unselected, non-mucinous epithelial OC patients.
        These genetic defects can predominantly lead to HR deficiency, the ultimate
        biomarker for therapeutic intervention by PARP inhibition leading to tumor-cell
        death. Citation Format: Florentia Fostira, Despoina Kalfakakou, Myrto S. Papamentzelopoulou,

        Gene panel testing has become the norm for assessing breast cancer (BC) susceptibility,
        but actual cancer risks conferred by genes included in panels are not established.
        Contrarily, deciphering the missing hereditability on BC, through identification
        of novel candidates, remains a challenge. We aimed to investigate the mutation
        prevalence and spectra in a highly selected cohort of Greek patients with
        BC, questioning an extensive number of genes, implicated in cancer predisposition
        and DNA repair, while calculating gene-specific BC risks that can ultimately
        lead to important associations. Methods To further discern BC susceptibility,
        a comprehensive 94-cancer gene panel was implemented in a cohort of 1382 Greek
        patients with BC, highly selected for strong family history and/or very young
        age (<35 years) at diagnosis, followed by BC risk calculation, based on a
        case\u2013control analysis. Results Herein, 31.5% of patients tested carried
        pathogenic variants (PVs) in 28 known, suspected or candidate BC predisposition
        genes. In total, 24.8% of the patients carried BRCA1/2 loss-of-function variants.
        An additional 6.7% carried PVs in additional genes, the vast majority of which
        can be offered meaningful clinical changes. Significant association to BC
        predisposition was observed for ATM, PALB2, TP53, RAD51C and CHEK2 PVs. Primarily,
        compared with controls, RAD51C PVs and CHEK2 damaging missense variants were
        associated with high (ORs 6.19 (Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC)) and 12.6
        (Fabulous Ladies Over Seventy (FLOSSIES)), p<0.01) and moderate BC risk (ORs
        3.79 (ExAC) and 5.9 (FLOSSIES), p<0.01), respectively. Conclusion Studying
        a large and unique cohort of highly selected patients with BC, deriving from
        a population with founder effects, provides important insight on distinct
        associations, pivotal for patient management.", "venue": "Journal of Medical

        for first-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer: AGENT", "abstract":
        "Abstract Background 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in combination with the folate
        Leucovorin (LV) has been the cornerstone in the treatment of colorectal cancer
        (CRC) for decades. All folates currently approved for use in the clinical
        setting need to be metabolically activated to [6R] 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolic
        acid ([6R]-MTHF), which is the active thymidylate synthase co-substrate that
        potentiates the effect of 5-FU. Arfolitixorin does not need multi step metabolic
        activation like currently available folates. It is therefore hypothesized
        that the administration of arfolitixorin will result in higher, and less individual
        variability, intracellular concentrations of the active thymidylate synthase
        co-substrate [6R]-MTHF in all patients compared to LV administration. Trial
        design Primary endpoint ORR by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) Key

        Secondary endpoints Overall Survival (OS) Quality of Life (QoL) Safety and
        Tolerability Patients undergoing curative metastasis resection Study Design
        This is a randomized, multicenter, parallel-group, Phase III study to compare
        the efficacy of arfolitixorin versus LV in patients with mCRC treated with
        5-FU, oxaliplatin, and bevacizumab. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio
        to either the investigational arm or the comparator arm. The study target
        is to randomize 440 patients in 18 months. An adaptive study design includes
        the possibility to increase the sample size to 660 patients as determined
        by the DSMB during the interim analysis to be conducted after 330 patients
        have conducted their 16 weeks scan. Key inclusion criteria: Adults > 18 years

        breast cancer", "abstract": "Background-Aim To evaluate the prognostic role
        of elaborate molecular clusters encompassing cyclin D1, cyclin E1, p21, p27
        and p53 in the context of various breast cancer subtypes. Methods Cyclin E1,
        cyclin D1, p53, p21 and p27 were evaluated with immunohistochemistry in 1077
        formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from breast cancer patients who had
        been treated within clinical trials. Jaccard distances were computed for the
        markers and the resulted matrix was used for conducting unsupervised hierarchical
        clustering, in order to identify distinct groups correlating with prognosis.
        Results Luminal B and triple-negative (TNBC) tumors presented with the highest
        and lowest levels of cyclin D1 expression, respectively. By contrast, TNBC
        frequently expressed Cyclin E1, whereas ER-positive tumors did not. Absence
        of Cyclin D1 predicted for worse OS, while absence of Cyclin E1 for poorer
        DFS. The expression patterns of all examined proteins yielded 3 distinct clusters;
        (1) Cyclin D1 and/or E1 positive with moderate p21 expression; (2) Cyclin
        D1 and/or E1, and p27 positive, p53 protein negative; and, (3) Cyclin D1 or
        E1 positive, p53 positive, p21 and p27 negative or moderately positive. The
        5-year DFS rates for clusters 1, 2 and 3 were 70.0%, 79.1%, 67.4% and OS 88.4%,
        90.4%, 78.9%, respectively. Conclusions It seems that the expression of cell
        cycle regulators in the absence of p53 protein is associated with favorable
        prognosis in operable breast cancer.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2017,

        Its breakpoints have been determined as c.5406 + 664_*8273del11052 (RefSeq:
        NM_007294.3) and a diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been set

        analysis was a retrospective evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of 2
        hypofractionated irradiation schedules compared to conventional therapy in
        post-mastectomy patients. Methods: 3 irradiation schedules were analyzed:
        48.30 Gy in 21 fractions (group A, n = 60), 42.56 Gy in 16 fractions (group
        B, n = 27) and 50 Gy in 25 fractions (group C, n = 30) of the front chest
        wall. All groups were also treated with a supraclavicular field, with 39.10
        Gy in 17 fractions (group A), 37.24 Gy in 14 fractions (group B) or 45 Gy
        in 25 fractions (group C). Results: No local recurrences were noted in any
        group during 36 months of follow-up. Acute skin toxicity presented in all
        groups, with 58.3%, 70.4% and 60% of grade I; 35%, 25.9% and 40% of grade
        II; 6.7%, 3.7% and 0% of grade III being seen in groups A, B and C, respectively.
        Late skin toxicity was noted only as grade I in 16.7%, 25.9% and 26.7% of
        groups A, B and C, respectively. No significant difference was noted among
        all groups for either acute or late skin toxicity, or for radio-pneumonitis
        (chi2 test, p > 0.05). Conclusion: All schedules were equally effective with
        equivalent toxicity. A prospective randomized study is needed to confirm our
        results.", "venue": "Breast Care", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 37, "citationCount":

        operable high-risk breast cancer.", "abstract": "577 Background: The aim of
        the study was to examine the prognostic and predictive significance of PI3K,
        AKT-1, mTOR, and PTEN mRNA expression and PIK3CA mutations in patients with
        operable high-risk breast cancer.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFormalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
        tumor tissue blocks were available from 279 out of 595 operable high-risk
        breast cancer patients enrolled in a phase III clinical trial of E-T-CMF vs
        E-CMF. Updated clinical data were retrospectively used in the present translational
        research study. RNA was isolated followed by kinetic one-step quantitative
        RT-PCR for assessment of the expression of PI3K, AKT-1, mTOR, and PTEN. Mutations
        (E542K, E545K and H1047R) in the helical (exon 9) and the kinase (exon 20)
        domains of the PIK3CA gene encoding the catalytic p110 subunit of PI3K were
        investigated with custom Taqman SNP genotyping assays in 223 tumor DNA samples
        from the patient population enrolled in this study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe two
        groups were well balanced concerning their basic characteristics except for
        grade (p = 0.015). The vast majority of hormone receptor positive patients
        (92%) received tamoxifen for 5 years, with LHRH analogs for premenopausal
        patients. The distribution of AKT-1 values was bimodal and therefore the 25th
        percentile was a natural cut-off. The median was used as a cut-off for all
        other genes. Mutations of the PIK3CA gene were detected in 51 patients (23%)
        (E542K in 8, E545K in 17 and H1047R in 26 patients). After a median follow-up
        time of 97 months, 93 patients (33%) had relapsed and 65 (23%) had died. High
        PI3K mRNA expression was associated with significantly shorter DFS (p = 0.044),
        irrespectively of the treatment arm. Multivariate analysis showed that high
        PI3K mRNA expression was an adverse prognostic factor for OS (HR = 2.14, 95%
        CI = 1.16-3.94, p = 0.015) and DFS (HR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.09-2.68, p = 0.02),
        while PIK3CA mutations negatively affected OS (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.07-3.95,
        p = 0.031). None of the other genes assessed was found to be of prognostic
        significance.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nHigh PI3K mRNA expression and PIK3CA mutations
        appear to be of adverse prognostic significance in patients with high-risk
        operable breast cancer. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

        "title": "Adjusting Breast Cancer Patient Prognosis with Non-HER2-Gene Patterns
        on Chromosome 17", "abstract": "Background HER2 and TOP2A gene status are
        assessed for diagnostic and research purposes in breast cancer with fluorescence
        in situ hybridization (FISH). However, FISH probes do not target only the
        annotated gene, while chromosome 17 (chr17) is among the most unstable chromosomes
        in breast cancer. Here we asked whether the status of specifically targeted
        genes on chr17 might help in refining prognosis of early high-risk breast
        cancer patients. Methods Copy numbers (CN) for 14 genes on chr17, 4 of which
        were within and 10 outside the core HER2 amplicon (HER2- and non-HER2-genes,
        respectively) were assessed with qPCR in 485 paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
        samples from breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy in
        the frame of two randomized phase III trials. Principal Findings HER2-genes
        CN strongly correlated to each other (Spearman\u2019s rho >0.6) and were concordant
        with FISH HER2 status (Kappa 0.6697 for ERBB2 CN). TOP2A CN were not concordant
        with TOP2A FISH status (Kappa 0.1154). CN hierarchical clustering revealed
        distinct patterns of gains, losses and complex alterations in HER2- and non-HER2-genes
        associated with IHC4 breast cancer subtypes. Upon multivariate analysis, non-HER2-gene
        gains independently predicted for shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and
        overall survival (OS) in patients with triple-negative cancer, as compared
        to luminal and HER2-positive tumors (interaction p\u200a=\u200a0.007 for DFS
        and p\u200a=\u200a0.011 for OS). Similarly, non-HER2-gene gains were associated
        with worse prognosis in patients who had undergone breast-conserving surgery
        as compared to modified radical mastectomy (p\u200a=\u200a0.004 for both DFS
        and OS). Non-HER2-gene losses were unfavorable prognosticators in patients
        with 1\u20133 metastatic nodes, as compared to those with 4 or more nodes
        (p\u200a=\u200a0.017 for DFS and p\u200a=\u200a0.001 for OS). Conclusions
        TOP2A FISH and qPCR may not identify the same pathology on chr17q. Non-HER2
        chr17 CN patterns may further predict outcome in breast cancer patients with
        known favorable and unfavorable prognosis.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year":

        patients with T1, 2N0Mx. The patients received 3-D conformal radiotherapy
        with a total physical dose of 50.54 Gy or 53.2 Gy in 19 or 20 fractions according
        to stage, over 23-24 d. The last three to four fractions were delivered as
        a sequential tumor boost. All patients were monitored for acute skin toxicity
        according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Radiation
        Therapy Oncology Group criteria. The maximum monitored value was taken as
        the final grading score. Multivariate analysis was performed for the contribution
        of age, chemotherapy and 19 vs 20 fractions to the radiation acute skin toxicity.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe
        acute radiation induced skin toxicity was as following: grade\u2005I\u200527.6%,
        grade II 7.8% and grade III 2.6%. No significant correlation was noted between
        toxicity grading and chemotherapy (P = 0.154, \u03c7(2) test). The mean values

        significantly to the development of acute skin toxicity but with a critical
        value of P = 0.05. However, in multivariate analysis, chemotherapy lost its
        statistical significance. None of the patients during the 2-years of follow-up

        In Situ Hybridization (FISH) and genomic Copy Number Variation (CNV) testing

        the clinical relevance of genomic CNV profiles on 17q (17q11.2-q12 to 17q21-q22)
        in the context of high-risk operable breast cancer. Methods: The CN status
        of NOS2, HER2, THRA, RARA and TOP2A was tested with 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-end-specific,
        exon-intron spanning qPCR CNV assays (two assays per gene). Software obtained
        CN values against normal DNA were evaluated from 439 informative paraffin
        breast cancer tissue samples with >50% tumor cells and were assessed (a) upon
        logarithmic transformation as continuous variables, and (b) as nominal variables
        with following CN categories: loss (>0-0.5 copies); no-gain or marginal accounting
        for DNA replication (1-4); low-gain (5-6) and high-gain (>6). For each gene,
        5\u2019- and 3\u2019-ends were evaluated separately for gene stability and
        in combination for obtaining the entire gene CN status. All patients had received
        adjuvant anthracyclines in the frame of two phase III trials. Results: Concordance
        between 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-end CN status was observed in 94.53% of tumors
        for TOP2A; 91.12% for THRA; 86.79% for HER2; 69.70% for RARA; and, 53.76%
        for NOS2. Strong associations were observed for classic HER2 FISH status with
        NOS2 (p=.0007), HER2 and THRA (both p Conclusions: Breast tumors with CN losses
        or complex losses/gains for the genes examined on 17q seem to carry the worst

        Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients; A Randomized Non-Comparative Phase II Trial",
        "abstract": "To explore the activity and safety of two schedules of ixabepilone,
        as first line chemotherapy, in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously
        treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, a randomized non-comparative phase II
        study was conducted. From November 2008 until December 2010, 64 patients were
        treated with either ixabepilone 40 mg/m2 every 3 weeks (Group A, 32 patients)
        or ixabepilone 20 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 every 4 weeks (Group B, 32 patients).
        Overall response rate (the primary end point) was 47% in Group A and 50% in
        Group B. The most frequent severe adverse events were neutropenia (32% vs.
        23%), metabolic disturbances (29% vs. 27%) and sensory neuropathy (12% vs.
        27%). Two patients in Group A and 3 in Group B developed febrile neutropenia.
        After a median follow-up of 22.7 months, median progression-free survival
        (PFS) was 9 months in Group A and 12 months in Group B. Median survival was
        26 months in Group A, whereas it was not reached in Group B. Multiple genetic
        and molecular markers were examined in tumor and peripheral blood DNA, but
        none of them was associated with ORR or drug toxicity. Favorable prognostic
        markers included: the T-variants of ABCB1 SNPs c.2677G/A/T, c.1236C/T and
        c.3435C/T, as well as high MAPT mRNA and Tau protein expression, which were
        all associated with the ER/PgR-positive phenotype; absence of TopoIIa; and,
        an interaction between low TUBB3 mRNA expression and Group B. Upon multivariate
        analysis, tumor ER-positivity was a favorable (p\u200a=\u200a0.0092) and TopoIIa
        an unfavorable (p\u200a=\u200a0.002) prognostic factor for PFS; PgR-positivity
        was favorable (p\u200a=\u200a0.028) for survival. In conclusion, ixabepilone
        had a manageable safety profile in both the 3-weekly and weekly schedules.
        A number of markers identified in the present trial appear to deserve further
        evaluation for their prognostic and/or predictive value in larger multi-arm

        inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the human epidermal
        growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/ErbB2), is approved for the treatment of HER2\u2212overexpressing
        (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (MBC) in combination with capecitabine following
        progression after trastuzumab, anthracyclines, and taxanes. Vinorelbine is
        an important chemotherapy option in MBC, and multiple phase II trials in combination
        with trastuzumab have been conducted. Methods: This randomized, open-label,
        multicenter, phase II study (VITAL, LAP112620, NCT01013740) is evaluating
        the efficacy and safety of lapatinib with either vinorelbine or capecitabine
        in women with HER2+ MBC. A total of 105 stage IV breast cancer patients with
        disease progression who have received \u22641 chemotherapy regimen in the
        metastatic setting with an ECOG performance status of \u22641 are randomized
        2:1 to either: lapatinib 1250 mg orally once daily (QD) continuously plus
        vinorelbine 20 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 every third week; or lapatinib
        1250 mg orally QD continuously plus capecitabine 2000 mg/m2/d orally in 2
        doses 12 hours apart on days 1 to 14 every third week. Following progression
        in the randomized phase, patients will be given the option to cross over to
        the other arm. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival and will
        be analyzed with a descriptive intent since the study is not powered to detect
        differences between treatment arms. Secondary endpoints include overall response
        rate, overall survival, duration of response, time to response, and clinical
        benefit rate. The study is currently recruiting in 8 countries in Europe (Bulgaria,
        France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Serbia, Spain) and 2 in Latin America

        Has More Aggressive Biology and Clinical Characteristics Compared to Synchronous
        Bilateral Breast Cancer (BBC)", "abstract": "Purpose: Bilateral breast cancer
        is an uncommon clinical entity. There is no specific treatment strategy and
        controversial issues concerning diagnostic criteria, management and classification
        exist. Method: In order to address some of these issues, a prospective analysis
        (data recorded upon patients first presentation) of an electronic breast cancer
        database at a tertiary cancer centre was performed. Patients\u2019 epidemiologic
        characteristics, clinical profile, genomic analysis information and the tumours\u2019
        histopathology were analyzed. Results: Out of 900 patients treated for breast
        cancer between 2006 and 2009, 44 diagnosed with bilateral disease (5% of total)having
        a median age of 53 years(range 32-73). 16 of them (36%)suffered from synchronous
        disease and 28 (64%)from metachronous { >3 months apart between the initial
        diagnosis and subsequent contralateral breast tumour). Genetic analysis revealed
        3 patients with inherited breast cancer syndromes (2 with BRCA1 and one with
        CDH-1 mutation). Among those with synchronous BBC 63% (10/16)were postmenopausal,
        50% (8/16)had a positive family history for breast cancer and upon initial
        diagnosis 80% (13/16)of them presented with early stage disease (stages I,II).Contralateral
        disease was diagnosed incidentally. In contrast to these patients with synchronous
        BBC,57% of the patients (16/28)with metachronous CBC were premenopausal and
        68% (19/28)had advanced disease (stages III,IV) upon the second diagnosis.
        Etrogens\u2019 use didn9t differ among the two groups, obesity was more common
        in patients with metachronous CBC, and smoking in the synchronous BBC patients.
        Of the 88 tumours, 81(92%) were invasive, with ductal adenoCa being the more
        common (53% of specimens). Of synchronous BBC tumours 12/16 (75%)were HR+
        positive and 80%(13/16) expressed the same biologic features bilaterally.
        Of the metachronous tumours, upon initial diagnosis,26% were triple negative
        and only 7% were found with HER2 amplification, compared with 41% and 26%
        respectively in the second diagnosis. Conclusions: Synchronous BBC is less
        prevalent than Metachronous CBC, has more favourable characteristics (earlier
        stage at diagnosis, hormonal receptor positivity), and occurs mainly among
        postmenopausal women with positive family history. Metachronous CBC is more
        common in premenopausal women and has a tendency to change its biological
        and clinical characteristics to a more aggressive phenotype (triple negative,
        HER2 amplification) between initial and latter diagnosis. If this phenomenon
        is a result of previously given chemo/radio-therapy or it reperesents the
        natural evolution to a second primary, remains a challenging question to be
        answered. Citation Information: Cancer Res 2010;70(24 Suppl):Abstract nr P6-10-06.",

        Associated with Improved Response to the Combination of Paclitaxel (P) and
        Bevacizumab (Bev) Therapy in Patients with HER2-Negative Metastatic Breast
        Cancer (MBC)", "abstract": "Background: Treatment with weekly P and 2-weekly
        Bev has been established as an active 1 st line treatment in patients with
        MBC. However, robust predictive or prognostic biomarkers for this treatment
        have not been identified as yet. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective
        analysis, we evaluated the activity of this combination in patients with HER2-negative
        MBC. Further, we explored the role of a panel of biomarkers on patients\u2019
        outcome. VEGF-A, VEGF-C, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 were centrally assessed
        by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 70 tissue blocks. P was administered either
        weekly 90 mg/m 2 x12 with 2-weekly Bev 10 \u00b5g/kg (86 patients) or 3-weekly
        175 mg/m 2 x6 with 3-weekly Bev 15\u00b5g/kg (38 patients). Bev was administered
        until progression in the majority of the patients. Results: The ORR did not
        differ significantly between the weekly or 3-weekly P schedule (55.8% vs 55.3%).
        In contrast to the published literature with P monotherapy, median PFS was
        significantly longer in the 3-weekly compared to the weekly P schedule (20.4
        months vs 10.2 months, p=0.029). Median survival has not been reached yet.
        2-year survival was 76.1% and 67.3%, respectively (p=0.085). High VEGFR1 and
        VEGFR3 protein expression, assessed by IHC, was associated with higher response
        rates (p=0.010 and p=0.039, respectively). Conclusions: This retrospective
        analysis confirmed the activity of P and Bev in patients with HER2-negative
        MBC. Protein expression of VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 was found to be of predictive
        value. These findings need to be validated in a larger cohort of patients
        treated with this combination. VEGF polymorphisms (VEGF-2578 and VEGF-1154)
        are currently assessed in peripheral blood DNA from our patients for possible
        predictive value. Citation Information: Cancer Res 2010;70(24 Suppl):Abstract

        Pharmaceuticals Considerations and Efficacy; A Review Article", "abstract":
        "Malignant gliomas (glioblastoma multiforme and anaplastic astrocytoma) which
        have a combined incidence of 5\u20138/100,000 population, represent the most
        common primary central nervous system tumors. The treatment outcomes even
        with aggressive approach including surgery, radiaton therapy and chemotherapy
        are dismal with median reported survival is less than 1 year. Temozolomide
        is a new drug which has shown promise in treating malignant gliomas and other
        difficult-to-treat tumors. This drug is a per os (p.o) imidazotetrazine second-generation
        alkylating agent which represents the leading compound in a new class of chemotherapeutic
        agents that enter the cerebrospinal fluid and do not require hepatic metabolism
        for activation. The efficacy of temozolomide was tested in vitro studies and
        has demonstrated schedule-dependent antitumor activity against highly resistant
        malignancies, including high-grade glioma (HGG). In addition, in clinical
        studies, temozolomide consistently demonstrates reproducible linear pharmacokinetics
        with approximately 100% p.o. bioavailability, noncumulative minimal myelosuppression
        that is rapidly reversible, and activity against a variety of solid tumors
        in both children and adults. Moreover, preclinical studies have evaluated
        the combination of temozolomide with other alkylating agents and inhibitors
        of the DNA repair protein O6-alkylguanine alkyltransferase to overcome resistance
        to chemotherapy in malignant glioma and malignant metastatic melanoma. At
        the present time temozolomide is approved in the United States for the treatment
        of adult patients with refractory anaplastic astrocytoma and, in the European
        Union, for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme showing progression or recurrence
        after standard therapy. Temozolomide\u2019s characteristics which make it
        a candidate for a wide range of clinical testing to evaluate the potential
        of combination treatments in different tumor types are its predictable bioavailability
        and minimal toxicity. An overview of the mechanism of action of temozolomide
        and a summary of results from more important randomized controlled clinical

        cell tumors of the ovary are rare neoplasms that originate from sex-cord stromal
        cells. The long natural history of granulosa cell tumors and their tendency
        to recur years after the initial diagnosis are the most prominent of their
        characteristics. The secretion of estradiol is the reason for signs at presentation
        such as vaginal bleeding and precocious puberty. Abdominal pain and hemoperitoneum,
        which occasionally can occur, are attributable to tumor rupture. The most
        common finding in pelvic examination is a tumor mass, which is subsequently
        confirmed with imaging techniques. Surgery is the mainstay of initial management
        for histological diagnosis, appropriate staging, and debulking. A more conservative
        unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is indicated in patients with stage I disease
        and patients of reproductive age. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
        salpingo-oophorectomy is the appropriate surgical treatment for postmenopausal
        women and those with more advanced disease. The stage of disease is the most
        important prognostic factor associated with the risk of relapse. There are
        no clear conclusions regarding the role of postoperative chemotherapy or radiotherapy
        in stage I disease and in those with completely resected tumor. The use of
        adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy has sometimes been associated with prolonged
        disease-free survival and possibly overall survival. Chemotherapy is the treatment
        of choice for patients with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease, and
        BEP (bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin) is the preferred regimen. Although
        the overall rate of response to treatment is high, the impact of treatment
        on disease-free or overall survival is unknown. Prolonged surveillance is
        mandatory because tumors tend to recur years after the initial diagnosis.",

        infusion and carboplatin in advanced breast cancer (final report): A phase
        II study conducted by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group", "abstract":
        "Summary Purpose: To evaluate the activity and toxicity of the combination
        of paclitaxel given by three-hour infusion, and carboplatin as first-line
        chemotherapy in patients with advanced breast cancer (ABC). Background: Paclitaxel
        is an active agent in ABC. Further-more, our group has shown that the combination
        of paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective in anthracycline-resistant ABC.
        Patients and methods: From January 1996 until March 1997, 66 women with ABC
        were treated with paclitaxel (175 mg/m 2 ) by three-hour infusion followed
        by carboplatin at an AUC of 6 mg x min/ml every three weeks. The median age
        of the patients was 56 years (range 28-75). A total of 39 patients had received
        adjuvant chemotherapy and 22 of them were treated with an anthracycline or
        mitoxantrone-containing regimen. Results: A total of 324 cycles (median: six)
        were administered, 273 (85%) of them at full dose. The median number of delivered
        cycles was six. The median delivered dose intensity (DI) of paclitaxel was
        55.1 mg/m 2 /week (range 30.5-69.3) and the relative DI was 0.95 (range 0.5-1.2).
        Eight patients (12%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 5%-22%) achieved complete
        and 28 (42%, 95% CI: 30%-55%) partial responses. Grade 3-4 toxicities included
        anemia (5%), granulocytopenia (24%), thrombocytopenia, nausea/vomiting and
        allergic reaction (3% each), myalgias/arthralgias and neurotoxicity (1,5%
        each). Febrile neutropenia occurred in eight (12%) patients. Alopecia was
        universal. After a median follow-up of 17.3 (range 0.07-24.5) months, 48 (72%)
        patients have demonstrated tumor progression and 24 (36%) have died. Median
        time to progression was 8.6 (range 0.07-23+) months and median survival 20.4
        (range 0.07-24.5+) months. Conclusions: The combination of paclitaxel and
        carboplatin has moderate activity in ABC and can be easily delivered on an
        outpatient basis with manageable toxicity. This regimen may be useful especially
        in patients to whom anthracyclines or cisplatin administration is precluded
        because of other concomitant diseases.", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "referenceCount":

        33\u201377) years and median performance status 0 (range, 0\u20132). Twenty
        patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy. The chemotherapeutic regimen
        consisted of 4 cycles of EPI 110 mg/m2 every 2 weeks followed by 4 cycles
        of paclitaxel, 225 mg/m2 over 3 hours every 2 weeks. G-CSF was administered
        prophylactically on days 2\u201310 of each cycle. 34 (83.0%) patients completed
        all 8 cycles of chemotherapy. A total of 304 cycles were administered, 259
        (85.0%) of them at full dose. Thirty (10.0%) cycles were delivered with a
        delay. The relative median dose intensities of EPI and paclitaxel were 0.95.
        Most common grade 3\u20134 side effects were anemia (15.0%) neutropenia (12.0%),
        thrombocytopenia (5.0%), nausea/vomiting (10.0%), febrile neutropenia (7.5%),
        and alopecia (90.0%). Overall, 8 (19.5%) patients achieved a complete and
        15 (36.5%) a partial response. Median duration of response was 8.4 (range,
        3.1\u201315.5+) months. After a median follow-up of 18.5 months, median time
        to progression was 8.7 (range, 0.5\u201321+) months; median survival has not
        been reached yet. Dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with EPI and paclitaxel
        shows promising activity as first-line treatment in ABC. Randomized studies
        comparing this type of chemotherapy with the classical administration of the
        two drugs together every 3 weeks are ongoing.", "venue": "Cancer Investigation",

        evaluated the efficacy and tolerance of the combination of docetaxel and vinorelbine
        as first line treatment in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). These agents have
        different mechanisms of action and both are active in advanced breast cancer.
        Thirty-nine chemotherapy-naive for metastatic disease patients were treated
        on an out-patient basis with vinorelbine 20 mg/m2 i.v. on days 1 and 8 and
        docetaxel 85 mg/m2 i.v. on day 8, every 3 weeks. Twenty-one (53.8%) patients
        had locoregional disease, 30 (76.9%) had distant metastases and 20 (51.3%)
        had visceral metastases. The intent-to-treat objective response rate (RR)
        was 48.75% (19 out of 39 patients; 95% confidence interval (CI), 32.4% to
        65.2%). Four patients (10.25%) achieved a complete response (CR) (95% CI,
        2.9% to 24.2%) and 15 (38.5%) a partial response (PR) (95% CI, 23.4% to 55.4%).
        The median duration of response was 4 months, the median time to progression
        (TTP) was 6 months and the median survival-time was 11.3 months. Grade 3 and/or
        4 (3/4) anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 7.7% and 5.1% of patients,
        respectively. Twelve (30.7%) patients developed grade 3/4 neutropenia and
        7 (17.9 %) were complicated with fever. Grade 3/4 diarrhea, nausea-vomiting,
        fatigue and constipation were not a problem. Alopecia was universal. Grade
        3/4 neurotoxicity was evident in 2.6% of patients. None of the patients developed
        allergic reaction or fluid retention. There was one treatment-related death
        due to grade 4 neutropenia and sepsis.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis combination of
        docetaxel and vinorelbine, a non-anthracycline-containing regimen, is a moderately
        effective regimen for the treatment of chemotherapy-naive breast cancer patients
        with metastases, causing only mild to moderate toxicity.", "venue": "Anticancer

        "Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a laboratory method to measure
        gains and losses in the copy number of chromosomal regions in tumor cells.
        It is hypothesized that certain DNA gains and losses are related to cancer
        progression and that the patterns of these changes are relevant to the clinical
        consequences of the cancer. It is therefore of interest to develop models
        which predict the occurrence of these events, as well as techniques for learning
        such models from CGH data. We continue our study of the mathematical foundations
        for inferring a model of tumor progression from a CGH data set that we started
        in Desper et al. (1999). In that paper, we proposed a class of probabilistic
        tree models and showed that an algorithm based on maximum-weight branching
        in a graph correctly infers the topology of the tree, under plausible assumptions.
        In this paper, we extend that work in the direction of the so-called distance-based
        trees, in which events are leaves of the tree, in the style of models common
        in phylogenetics. Then we show how to reconstruct the distance-based trees
        using tree-fitting algorithms developed by researchers in phylogenetics. The
        main advantages of the distance-based models are that 1) they represent information
        about co-occurrences of all pairs of events, instead of just some pairs, 2)
        they allow quantitative predictions about which events occur early in tumor
        progression, and 3) they bring into play the extensive methodology and software
        developed in the context of phylogenetics. We illustrate the distance-based
        tree method and how it complements the branching tree method, with a CGH data
        set for renal cancer.", "venue": "J. Comput. Biol.", "year": 2000, "referenceCount":

        fractures and anaemia. Occasionally, significant numbers of plasma cells circulate
        in the bloodstream. Hypercalcaemia and Bence Jones proteinuria are the main
        reasons for renal impairment, but amyloidosis and monoclonal immunoglobulin
        deposition should also be considered. Neurological impairment is most often
        due to spinal cord pressure by an extradural plasma cell tumour. In some patients,
        symptoms and signs of peripheral neuropathy may be present. Amyloidosis complicates
        the course of a minority of patients with MM and further impairs the performance
        of affected patients. Circulating monoclonal protein may increase serum viscosity,
        impair the function of platelets and coagulation factors, and behave as a
        cryoglobulin. The levels of uninvolved immunoglobulins are usually decreased,
        rendering patients susceptible to various bacterial infections. One or more
        of these complications provides a clue for the diagnosis, forms the basis
        for defining prognosis and must be managed expeditiously and concurrently,
        with the institution of specific treatment for the myeloma.", "venue": "Bailliere''s

        of isolated central nervous system (CNS) relapse in patients with EOC who
        received primary treatment with platinum and paclitaxel have not been identified.
        We conducted a retrospective study in patients with EOC who relapsed with
        isolated brain metastases and report our experience. Two hundred sixty-seven
        patients with stages III and IV EOC, in clinical complete remission after
        first-line treatment with platinum and paclitaxel, were included in our analysis.
        After a median follow-up of 65 months, 150 patients had relapsed. Eight patients
        (5%) had isolated brain metastases. Patient and disease characteristics did
        not differ among patients who relapsed with isolated brain metastases and
        those with relapse outside the CNS. Median time to first disease relapse,
        overall survival, and survival after relapse did not differ significantly
        between patients with brain metastases and those with relapse outside the
        CNS. Two patients have died 6 and 12 months after the diagnosis of brain metastases,

        brain metastases. Three patients remain free of disease 4\u201318 months after
        treatment with radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy for their CNS metastatic
        disease. Patients with isolated brain metastases have comparable survival

        carcinoma of the uterine cervix.", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nBoth paclitaxel and
        cisplatin have moderate activity in patients with metastatic or recurrent
        cancer of the cervix, and the combination of these two agents has shown activity
        and possible synergism in a variety of solid tumors. We administered this
        combination to patients with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer to evaluate
        its activity.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThirty-four consecutive patients
        were treated on an outpatient basis with paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 administered
        intravenously over a 3-hour period followed by cisplatin 75 mg/m2 administered
        intravenously with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support. The chemotherapy
        was administered every 3 weeks for a maximum of six courses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen
        patients (47%; 95% confidence interval, 30% to 65%) achieved an objective
        response, including five complete responses and 11 partial responses. Responses
        occurred in 28% of patients with disease within the radiation field only and
        in 57% of patients with disease involving other sites. The median duration
        of response was 5.5 months, and the median times to progression and survival
        for all patients were 5 and 9 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities
        included anemia in 18% of patients and granulocytopenia in 15% of patients.
        Fifty-three percent of patients developed some degree of neurotoxicity; 21%
        of cases were grade 2 or worse.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination of paclitaxel
        with cisplatin seems relatively well tolerated and moderately active in patients
        with metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer. The significant incidence of
        neurotoxicity is of concern, and alternative methods of administration of
        the two agents could be evaluated. Then, further study of this combination,
        alone or with the addition of other active agents, is warranted.", "venue":

        AND METHODS\nFifty-one chemotherapy-naive patients with NSCLC were treated
        with gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel 100
        mg/m2 intravenously on day 8 with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (150
        microg/m2, subcutaneously) support from day 9 to day 15. Treatment was repeated
        every 3 weeks.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe patients'' median age was 64 years. The World
        Health Organization performance status was 0 to 1 in 39 patients and 2 in
        12 patients. Fifteen patients (29%) had stage IIIB disease, and 36 (71%) had
        stage IV; histology was mainly squamous cell carcinoma (59%). A partial response
        was achieved in 19 patients (37.5%; 95% confidence interval, 24% to 50%);
        stable disease and progressive disease were each observed in 16 patients (31.4%).
        The median duration of response and the time to tumor progression were 5 and
        6 months, respectively. The median survival was 13 months, and the actuarial
        1-year survival was 50.7%. Grade 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia were rare (2%).
        Four patients (8%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and all were complicated
        with fever; there was no treatment-related death. Grade 3 or 4 diarrhea occurred
        in three patients (6%), grade 2 or 3 neurotoxicity in four patients (8%),
        grade 2 or 3 asthenia in 10 patients (20%), and grade 2 or 3 edema in 10 patients
        (20%).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination of docetaxel/gemcitabine is well tolerated,
        can be used for outpatients, and is active for the treatment of advanced NSCLC.
        This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin- or carboplatin-based

        breast cancer (TNBC) represents the subtype of breast cancer with the most
        aggressive biological behavior and the worst prognosis compared to other breast
        cancers. Metastatic TNBC is characterized by a high proliferative index, rapid
        progression with metastases to the viscera and central nervous system, and
        generally an unfavorable prognosis with a survival of about one year. It is,
        therefore, necessary to identify specific targets and more effective treatments
        for patients with TNBC. Evidence of the effect of the tumor immune microenvironment
        on clinical outcomes is considered a significant issue in breast cancer therapeutics.
        Compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC is characterized by a higher
        mutational burden and is recognized as the most immunogenic among them. Based
        on these findings, immune checkpoint inhibition was evaluated in TNBC with
        encouraging results. Indeed, enhancing antitumor immunity in TNBC by blocking
        the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) axis or the programmed
        cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway is

        for Strong Associations with Estrogen Receptor Positivity, Overuse of Risk-Reducing
        Procedures and Population Founder Effects", "abstract": "Simple Summary CHEK2
        germline pathogenic variants are identified at a relatively high frequency
        among hereditary breast cancer cases and are known to be associated with intermediate
        breast cancer risk i.e., 2\u20132.5-fold increase, compared to the general
        population. Histopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes of breast
        cancer patients who are CHEK2 carriers have not been thoroughly investigated.
        We have therefore sought to determine the CHEK2 variant spectrum and identify
        variants with possible founder effect, while investigating the clinicopathological
        features and outcomes of Greek patients who were CHEK2 carriers. Three variants
        have been identified as Greek founders. The vast majority of CHEK2-associated
        breast tumors were hormone receptor positive, underlying a possible benefit
        from chemoprophylaxis with tamoxifen. A trend for longer survival was observed
        in patients that underwent mastectomy and received hormone-therapy. Nearly
        half of patients underwent a risk-reducing surgery, which was not mandated
        according to current guidelines or relevant risks associated with CHEK2. Abstract
        CHEK2 germline pathogenic variants predispose to breast cancer and possibly
        to other malignancies, with their spectrum and frequency being variable among
        populations. \u03a4he majority of CHEK2-associated breast tumors are hormone
        receptor positive; however, relevant clinical outcomes are not well defined.
        Herein, we illustrate the histopathological characteristics and clinical outcomes
        of 52 Greek breast cancer patients who are CHEK2 carriers. Genetic analysis
        was performed by Sanger/massively parallel sequencing, followed by MLPA. Subsequent
        haplotype analysis investigated possible founder effects. Blood relatives
        were offered cascade testing. CHEK2 variant spectrum was characterized by
        variability, while influenced by founder effects. The majority of carriers,
        i.e., 60.8%, were diagnosed with breast cancer before the age of 45. Notably,
        91.5% of breast tumors were hormone receptor positive. Hormone therapy and
        mastectomy at diagnosis seem to have a positive trend on overall survival,
        after a median follow-up of 9.5 years. Remarkably, 41.9% of patients underwent
        risk-reducing surgery, one third of which involved salpingo-oophorectomy.
        Nearly half of families responded to cascade testing. Our data highlight the
        need for guideline-adherent choices, based on the evidence that CHEK2 carriers
        are at moderate risk for breast cancer and no risk for ovarian cancer, while
        underscore the possible role of chemoprevention with tamoxifen.", "venue":

        balance between pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors is disturbed in
        favor of a pro-angiogenic outcome (angiogenic switch) early in the neoplastic
        progression of adenomas, thus, resulting in neovascularization and eventually
        in malignant tumor progression. Furthermore, angiogenesis plays an important
        role in tumor growth and the formation of metastases. Several angiogenic growth
        factors have been identified to be highly expressed during the progression
        and metastatic spread of CRC, but VEGFA is the predominant angiogenic cytokine
        and the most consistently expressed factor during the metastatic process.
        Agents targeting VEGF/VEGFR signaling have shown efficacy in the treatment
        of mCRC and are currently approved in this setting. In this review, we summarize

        and overall survival (OS) in patients with cancer referred to Hellenic Cooperative
        Oncology Group\u2013affiliated Departments. Patients and methods: Patients
        referred from 12/1980 to 1/2017 had molecular testing (for research) of archival
        tumor tissue collected at the time of first diagnosis (non-metastatic, 81%;
        metastatic, 19%). Tumor-specific gene panels (16-101 genes) were used to identify
        pathogenic mutations in clinically relevant genes. NGS genotyping was performed
        at the Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.
        Annotation of mutations was performed at MD Anderson Cancer Center. Results:
        We analyzed 3,084 patients (median age, 57 years; men, 22%) with sequencing
        data. Overall, 1,775 (58% of 3,084) patients had pathogenic mutations. The
        median follow-up was 7.52 years (95% CI, 7.39-7.61). In patients with non-metastatic
        tumors, after stratification by tumor type, increasing age, higher grade,
        and histology other than adenocarcinoma were associated with shorter OS. OS
        was also shorter in patients with pathogenic TP53 (HR=1.36; p<0.001), MLL3
        (HR=1.64; p=0.005), and BRCA1 (HR=1.46; p=0.047) mutations compared to wild-type
        genes. In multivariate analyses, independent prognostic factors predicting
        shorter OS were pathogenic mutations in TP53 (HR=1.37, p=0.002) and MLL3 (HR=1.50,
        p=0.027); increasing age (HR=1.02, p<0.001); and increasing grade (HR=1.46,
        p<0.001). In patients with metastatic cancer, older age and higher grade were
        associated with shorter OS and maintained their independent prognostic significance
        (increasing age, HR=1.03, p<0.001 and higher grade, HR=1.73, p<0.001). Conclusions:

        variants have been linked to increased breast and ovarian cancer risk, with
        more than 5,000 distinct pathogenic variants being reported worldwide. Among
        individuals of Greek descent, the BRCA1/2 variant spectrum is heterogeneous,
        but characterized by strong founder effects. As patients from certain geographical
        regions of Greece (like Crete) were underrepresented in previous studies,
        we hypothesized that isolated Cretans, a southern Greece islanders'' population
        with distinct demographic, cultural and genetic features, could harbor founder
        BRCA1/2 mutations. A total of 304 breast or/and ovarian cancer patients of
        Cretan descent, fulfilling NCCN criteria for genetic testing, were tested
        by NGS or Sanger sequencing, followed by MLPA. Haplotype analysis was subsequently
        performed to investigate potential founder effects of recurrent alleles. Overall,
        16.5% (50/304) of the tested patients carried 22 different pathogenic variants;
        48% in BRCA1, 52% in BRCA2. Three variants, namely two in BRCA2 (\u0394exons
        12 and 13 and c.7806\u20102A>T) and one in BRCA1 (c.5492del), constituting
        approximately half (48%) of all detected pathogenic variants, were shown to
        have a founder effect, with all carriers sharing common haplotypes. Remarkably,
        these variants were confined to Cretans and have not been identified in other
        regions of Greece. The high prevalence of specific BRCA1/2 pathogenic variants
        among Cretans, provides the possibility of cost\u2010 and time\u2010efficient
        screening of the Cretan population. Integrating this knowledge in local public
        health services may have a significant impact on cancer prevention, and may

        the burden of symptomatic and asymptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) in
        patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy is limited. The aim of our study
        was to prospectively investigate the frequency of symptomatic VTE and asymptomatic
        deep vein thrombosis of the lower limbs among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe
        studied 231 patients (164 men) with pancreatic (n=36), lung (n=136), ovarian
        (n=32) or prostate (n=27) cancer receiving first line (n=192, 83.1%) or adjuvant
        chemotherapy, followed-up for 3-6 months.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSome 17 patients were
        diagnosed with VTE, either asymptomatic detected on leg ultrasound (n=7) or
        symptomatic (n=10). The total frequency of VTE was 10.3% (17/165 with follow-up).
        Pancreatic cancer had the highest frequency of VTE (4/25, 16%) followed by
        ovarian (3/26, 11.5%) and lung cancer (10/94, 10.6%). There was no statistically
        significant difference in VTE rates among cancer types (p=0.36). VTE occurred
        more frequently in the presence of metastases (13/85, 15.3% vs. 4/80, 5.0%,
        for the remainder, p=0.03, OR 3.4). In the subgroup of patients receiving
        first line treatment, VTE occurred more frequently in patients with metastases
        (13/84, 15.5% vs 2/53, 3.8%, for the remainder, p=0.033). In patients with
        pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer receiving first line treatment, VTE occurred
        more frequently in patients with metastatic disease (19.1% vs. 4.0%, for the
        remainder, p=0.015).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nVTE occurrence in this real-world patient
        cohort was high, reaching almost 20% in certain groups, like those with disseminated
        pancreatic, lung or ovarian cancer receiving first-line chemotherapy. Furthermore,
        VTE occurs mostly as a symptomatic event, being likely a result of the prothrombotic

        in Endometrial Carcinoma?", "abstract": "Aim: To study whether mismatch repair
        (MMR) status is related to the expression of programmed cell death-ligand
        1 (PD-L1) and CD8 counts in a series of grade 3 endometrial carcinomas. Materials
        and Methods: The expression of MMR protein PD-L1 and CD8+ cell count were
        evaluated by immunohistochemistry and related to several clinicopathological
        parameters. Results: Among 105 endometrial carcinomas, 40% were of endometrioid
        and 60% of non-endometrioid histology. MMR deficiency was observed in 28.6%
        of cases and was related to endometrioid histology (p<0.001), positive PD-L1
        expression (p=0.047) and high CD8+ cell count (p=0.022). When examined by
        histotype, endometrioid MMR-deficient tumors were related only to PD-L1 expression
        (p=0.032) but not to high CD8+ cell count (p=0.231), whereas non-endometrioid
        MMR-deficient carcinomas were not related to either of these markers. MMR
        deficiency was associated with PD-L1+/CD8high status (p=0.006), whilst MMR
        proficiency was associated with PD-L1\u2212/CD8low status. In MMR-proficient
        tumors, high CD8+ cell infiltration alone and combined with PD-L1\u2212 status
        was associated with better progression-free survival (p=0.013 and p=0.04,
        respectively). Conclusion: MMR-deficient high-grade endometrioid tumors might
        be more likely to benefit from immunotherapy compared to other grade 3 endometrial
        carcinomas.", "venue": "Anticancer Research", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nColorectal cancer is the fourth cause of cancer related
        death. Drug resistance and toxicity remain major clinical issues. HOTAIR and
        MALAT1 are long non-coding RNAS that affect cellular proliferation, apoptosis
        and drug resistance; their up-regulation has been linked with a poor prognosis.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nInvestigation
        of the association between rs4759314 HOTAIR and rs3200401 MALAT1 polymorphisms
        and irinotecan-based chemotherapy in terms of drug efficacy and toxicity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSamples
        from 98 patients receiving different regimens of irinotecan-based therapy
        were included. Efficacy and toxicity were evaluated. KRAS mutation, rs3200401
        HOTAIR and rs4759314 MALAT1 polymorphisms genotyping in the tumors and peripheral
        blood respectively were performed with PCR.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeither rs3200401
        MALAT1 nor rs4759314 HOTAIR polymorphism are associated with response to treatment
        regimens. Rs4759314 was also not associated with increased toxicity in patients
        receiving irinotecan-based regimens. CT genotype of rs3200401 was associated
        with significantly reduced overall survival. An association between KRAS mutation
        and AG/GG genotypes in the rs4759314 was detected.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCT genotype
        of rs3200401 MALAT1 polymorphism could serve as a toxicity biomarker. Carriers
        of the G allele of the rs4759314 HOTAIR are more likely to be carriers of

        bowel adenocarcinoma.", "abstract": "e15037 Background: Small-bowel adenocarcinomas
        (SBAs) are rare cancers with a significantly lower incidence, later stage
        at diagnosis, and worse overall survival than other intestinal-derived cancers.
        Activating KRAS and/or BRAF mutations have been identified as predictors of
        resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) The aim of this
        study was to perform a comprehensive immunohistochemical.analysis of KRAS,
        NRAS, V600E BRAF mutations and microsatellite instability using a cohort of
        surgically resected cases in our institution. Methods: A total of 17 patients
        (10 males and 7 females; mean age, 56.2 years old; range, 45-75 years old)
        received chemotherapy due to non-curative tumor resection, unresectable tumor
        or post-operative recurrence. Twelve patents received fluoropirimidine and
        oxaliplatin based first line chemotherapy. Molecular targeted agents were
        administered to 15 patients, for whom it was their first- or second-line therapy.
        Results: KRAS mutations were found in 7 cases (41%), out of which 5 (29%)
        were in exons 12/13. BRAFV600E mutation was observed in 1/17 pt. Microsatellite
        instability was identified in 3/17pt (MSI; 18%), mainly related to a loss
        of expression of MLH1 protein. Univariate analysis revealed a PS of 0 (P=0.0226)
        and treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy (P=0.0047) were significant
        factors for an improved prognosis. Among the 12 patients who received oxaliplatin-based
        chemotherapy as a first-line chemotherapy, a PS of 0 (P=0.0255) and treatment
        with anti-EGFR agents (P=0.0127) were significant positive prognostic factors.
        Toxicities due to the molecular targeted agents were not experienced. The
        median overall survival time was 14.3 months (range, 3-52 months), the median
        DFS was 14.2 months and the median OS was 32 months. Conclusions: To date,
        there is no standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced SBAs and little is
        known about their molecular characteristics. The results of the present study
        indicate that oxaliplatin based chemotherapy containing molecular targeted
        agents is a well-tolerated and effective treatment option for SBA. A better
        understanding of disease biology may help to identify therapeutic targets
        and advance precision medicine.", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Oncology",

        "Aim To compare distinct clinicopathological features between atypical proliferative
        serous tumors and non-invasive low-grade ovarian serous carcinomas. Methods
        Our study group comprised 203 cases of serous borderline tumors sub-classified
        as atypical proliferative serous tumors or as non-invasive low-grade serous
        carcinomas. All pathological features related to borderline tumors were re-evaluated
        by two gynecological pathologists. Data concerning recurrences and survival
        were retrieved from the medical records of the patients. Results When comparing
        atypical proliferative serous tumors to non-invasive low-grade serous carcinomas,
        the latter were statistically related to advanced stage at diagnosis, bilateral
        disease, exophytic pattern of growth, microinvasive carcinoma, and the presence
        of invasive implants. In univariate analysis, recurrences were statistically
        related to the exophytic pattern of growth, to microinvasion, and to the presence
        of implants (both invasive and non-invasive). Nevertheless, in multivariate
        analysis, only microinvasion and the presence of invasive implants were related
        to recurrence. Women who eventually succumbed to the disease were only those
        with invasive implants. Their ovarian tumor was either a non-invasive low-grade
        serous carcinoma or an atypical proliferative serous tumor with \u2018minimal\u2019
        micropapillary pattern. Neither lymph node involvement nor endosalpingiosis
        seemed to influence the course of the disease. Conclusions The results of
        our study underline the increased possibility of non-invasive low-grade serous
        carcinomas to be related with features indicative of aggressive behavior as
        opposed to atypical proliferative serous tumors. Nevertheless, irrespective
        of tumor histology, the presence of invasive implants and microinvasion were

        (MMR) status in a series of high-grade endometrial carcinomas and correlate
        it with several clinicopathological characteristics and with survival.\n\n\nMETHODS\nOne
        hundred and one patients with high-grade endometrial carcinoma, both of endometrioid
        and of non-endometrioid type were included in the study. The expression of
        MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn
        our cohort, 41 women had an endometrioid and 60 women a non-endometrioid carcinoma.
        Endometrioid histotype was statistically more frequent in deficient MMR (dMMR)
        tumors (73.3%), while non-endometrioid carcinomas in proficient (pMMR) cases
        (73.8%) (p<0.001). When analyzing the group of endometrioid and non-endometrioid
        carcinomas separately, only dMMR endometrioid cancers were found to be statistically
        related to deep myometrial invasion, lymph-node metastases and advanced stage
        (p=0.035, p=0.011 and p=0.028, respectively). Univariate and multivariate
        analysis revealed no relation between MMR status and progression-free survival
        (PFS) or overall survival (OS). Adjuvant treatment was not found to influence
        the course of the disease. When MMR proteins were studied separately, MLH1/PMS2
        loss was related to deep myometrial invasion (p=0.019 and p=0.036, respectively)
        and MSH6 loss to lymph-node metastases (p=0.04).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn our
        group of high-grade endometrial carcinomas, MMR deficiency was statistically
        more frequent in endometrioid than in non-endometrioid cancers. Furthermore,
        only dMMR endometrioid type grade 3 carcinomas were found to be related with
        features indicative of aggressive behavior. Considering some unique relation

        identify prognostic factors of survival and recurrence in advanced ovarian
        cancer patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis, undergoing cytoreductive surgery
        and Hyperthermic IntraPEritoneal Chemotherapy (HIPEC). In particular, to identify
        the rate and possible role of metastatic lymph nodes, according to their anatomic
        distribution. Methodology Retrospective analysis of 152 patients with advanced
        ovarian cancer that underwent complete or near-complete cytoreduction, which
        included at least one colonic resection and HIPEC. Clinical and histopathological
        variables were correlated to survival and recurrence. All patients were treated
        by a single team, with a standard protocol for surgical technique/HIPEC. Results
        Mean age of the patients was 58.8 years and complete cytoreductive surgery
        was possible in 72.4%. The rates of in-hospital mortality and major morbidity
        were 2.6% and 15.7%, respectively. Only 122 (80.3%) patients were able to
        complete adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Rates of metastatic total lymph nodes,
        para-aortic and pelvic lymph nodes and large bowel lymph nodes were 58.7%,
        58.5%, and 51.3%, respectively. The median, 5- and 10-year survival rates
        were 39 months, 43%, and 36.2%, respectively. The recurrence rate was 35.5%.
        On univariate analysis, near-complete cytoreduction, high Peritoneal Cancer
        Index, in-hospital morbidity, and no adjuvant systemic chemotherapy were adverse
        prognostic factors, both, for survival and recurrence. On multivariate analysis,
        negative prognostic survival indicators were the advanced age of patients,
        extensive peritoneal dissemination, low total number of resected lymph nodes
        and no systemic para-aortic/pelvic lymphadenectomy. Metastatic large bowel
        lymph nodes and segmental resections of the small intestine were associated
        with a high risk for recurrence. Conclusion Retroperitoneal lymph nodes are
        frequently involved in advanced ovarian cancer. Our data show that extensive
        lymphadenectomy, including systemic para-aortic/pelvic and large bowel lymphadenectomy,
        may be important in advanced ovarian cancer surgery, as it may confer to survival
        improvement and decrease the risk of recurrence. Disclosure Nothing to disclose.

        to immunotherapy in high-grade endometrial carcinomas?", "abstract": "Introduction/Background
        The recent food and drug administration (FDA) approval of immunotherapy for
        all microsatellite unstable carcinomas, has strengthen the need for more detailed
        studies, in order to highlight the group of endometrial cancers that would
        probably favor from thisnew therapeutic option. One of the hallmarks of carcinomas
        with microsatellite instability (MSI), is the increased neo-antigen load which
        leads to an enhanced immune environment. Our goal was to evaluate by immunohistochemistry,
        whether mismatch repair (MMR) status was related to CD8 high intratumoral
        infiltration and PD-L1 expression in a series of high-grade endometrial carcinomas
        and correlate it with several clinicopathological characteristics and with
        survival. Methodology The cohort comprised 40 high grade endometrioid, 36
        serous, 4 clear cell, 5 unclassified and 7 mixed carcinomas as well as 8 Malignant
        Mixed Mullerian tumors. All patients were fully surgically staged. Postoperative
        treatment varied according to the tumor''s characteristics. Immunohistochemistry
        for MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, CD8 and PD-L1 was performed. Results MMR deficient
        tumors were strongly related to endometrioid type carcinomas (p<0,001), high
        CD8 counts (p=0,015), positive PD-L1 tumors (p=0,029) and deep myometrial
        invasion (p=0,014). Nevertheless, when CD8+ and PD-L1 high tumors were grouped
        together, they were statistically related to MMR deficiency irrespective of
        tumor sub-type whereas combined CD8+/PD-L1 low expression was statistically
        associated with MMR proficient tumors. Both in Kaplan-Mayer univariate and
        in multivariate analysis, only high CD8+ cells were related to longer progression
        free survival (p=0,006 and p=0,008 respectively)). Conclusion In high grade
        endometrial carcinomas, both of endometrioid and of non-endometrioid type,
        a high CD8+ microenvironment represents an independent favorable prognostic
        factor for progression free survival. The significant statistical relation
        of MMR deficient tumors with high intratumoral CD8 counts and positive PD-L1
        expression might imply that therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors could
        be effective in high grade endometrial carcinomas featuring microsatellite

        The clinical relevance of mismatch repair (MMR) status in patients with nonmetastatic
        cancer across tumour types remains unclear. Our goal was to investigate the
        prognostic role of MMR deficiency in patients with stage I-III colorectal
        and endometrial cancer. Methods Patients with nonmetastatic colorectal and
        endometrial cancer with tumour tissue available for analysis were identified
        through the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG)\u2019s tumour repository.
        Patients had been referred to Departments of Medical Oncology affiliated with
        HeCOG. MMR protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The primary
        outcome measure was overall survival (OS). Results From May 1990 to September
        2012, 1158 patients with nonmetastatic colorectal (N = 991) and endometrial
        cancer (N = 167) were identified (median age: 64 years, men: 544). All patients
        with colorectal and 109 (65%) with endometrial cancer had received adjuvant
        treatment. MMR deficiency was observed in 114 (11.5%) of colorectal and 80
        (47.9%) of endometrial tumours. More commonly deficient proteins were PMS2
        (69 patients, 7%) and MLH1 (63 patients, 6.5%) in colorectal cancer and MSH2
        (58 patients, 34.7%) in endometrial cancer. Colorectal MMR-deficient (dMMR)
        tumours were more likely to be right sided (65 % dMMR vs 27 % proficient MMR,
        pMMR; p < 0.001), high grade (31% vs 15%, \u03c72, p < 0.001) and with a mucinous
        component (64% vs 42%, p < 0.001). Endometrial dMMR tumours were more often
        of endometrioid histology (51.4 % endometrioid vs 20 % serous/clear cell,
        p = 0.020). Compared with MMR proficiency, MMR deficiency was associated with
        improved OS in patients with endometrial cancer (HR = 0.38, 95%\u2009CI 0.20
        to 0.76, p = 0.006), but not in patients with colorectal cancer (HR = 0.73,
        95%\u2009CI 0.49 to 1.09, p = 0.130). After adjusting for age, stage and grade,
        MMR deficiency maintained its favourable prognostic significance in patients
        with endometrial cancer (HR = 0.42, 95%\u2009CI 0.20 to 0.88, p = 0.021).
        Conclusions DMMR was associated with improved outcomes in patients with nonmetastatic
        endometrial cancer, but not in patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer

        versus standard-of-care (SOC) platinum-based therapy as first-line treatment
        of stage 3/4 non-mucinous epithelial ovarian cancer (OC).", "abstract": "TPS5600
        Background: Despite surgery and SOC therapy (paclitaxel and carboplatin \u00b1
        bevacizumab[bev]), 5-year survival rates remain low for patients (pts) with
        FIGO stage 3/4 OC. Niraparib (ZEJULA) is the first selective poly(ADP-ribose)
        polymerase inhibitor (PARPi) approved in the US and Europe for maintenance
        treatment in pts with recurrent OC regardless of BRCAmut status. Preclinical
        data suggest synergy with PARPi + anti-PD-1 blockade. Niraparib + pembrolizumab
        has shown clinical efficacy in pts with platinum-resistant or secondary refractory
        OC regardless of biomarker status. Dostarlimab is an anti\u2013PD-1 humanized
        monoclonal with clinical activity as monotherapy in early phase trials. The
        primary objective of the currently enrolling FIRST trial is to compare PFS
        (per RECIST v1.1) in pts treated with SOC + dostarlimab + niraparib to SOC.
        Methods: Eligible pts (up to 912) are FIGO stage 3 (with residual disease,
        CC0 high risk, or planned neoadjuvant therapy) or stage 4, non-mucinous epithelial
        OC and ECOG score < 2. After 1 cycle of SOC, pts are stratified by concurrent
        bev use, BRCAmut/HRR status, and disease burden then randomized as 1:1:2 to
        1 of 3 arms (Table). An innovative feature of ENGOT-OV44/FIRST (NCT03602859;
        EUDRACT 2018-000413-20) is the pre-planned adaptive study design to adapt
        the control arm to the evolving SOCs in OC, allowing pts in the control arm
        to receive up to date SOC. These adaptations will occur when practice-changing
        data are released. Following publication of SOLO1 results, BRCAmut pts will
        only be randomized to arm 2 or 3 to ensure they receive niraparib. Further
        adaptations may be incorporated as new data become available, leading to stop
        randomization in arm 1 or 2 of pts based on their biomarker status. Clinical
        trial information: NCT03602859. [Table: see text]", "venue": "Journal of Clinical

        Human epidermal growth factor receptor- (HER2-) targeted therapy with the
        he antibody-drug conjugate Ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) has revolutionized
        the management of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Although well-tolerated
        , cardiotoxicity has been documented. Sequential left ventricular (LV) ejection
        fraction (EF) assessment has been mandated to detect myocardial dysfunction.
        Changes in cardiac function induced by this therapy, however, are difficult
        to quantitate by conventional echocacardiography. Tissue Doppler myocardial
        imaging (TDI) derived wall motion velocity, and strain rate (SR) have been
        shown to sensitively quantify abnormalities in cardiac function. The aim of
        this study was to determine if sensitive indices of LV dysfunction, would
        be useful for addressing the early detection of cardiotoxic side effects of
        TDM1. Methods: Patients (N = 36 median age 56.8 years) with HER2-positive

        Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) characterized by aggressive tumor behavior
        with very poor prognosis following progression after standard chemotherapeutic
        regimens.The combination of Gemcitabine, a nucleoside analogue, and eribulin
        a microtubule-targeting agent exhibited synergistic cytotoxic effects in pre-clinicall
        and clinical setting . Thus, eribulin combined with gemcitabine may synergistically
        induce tumor cell death, especially in tumors like TNBC. Based on this rationale,
        we conducted a phase II study evaluating this combination either in first-
        or in second-line treatment for advanced TNBC.Methods: Females with locally
        advanced or metastatic TNBC who had received previous chemotherapy , with
        an ECOG (PS) \u2264 1, and adequate hematological, renal and hepatic function.

        Chemotherapy.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe retinoblastoma (RB) gene is a
        tumor-suppressor gene that plays a central role in regulating the cell cycle.
        Inactivation of this gene is involved in breast cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND
        METHODS\nA total of 827 patients with breast cancer treated with taxane-based
        adjuvant chemotherapy were included in the study. Protein expression of RB,
        phosphorylated RB (pRB), p16, cyclin D1 and p53 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeither
        of the retinoblastoma markers (RB and pRB) reached statistical significance
        in terms of their association with disease-free or overall survival. Nevertheless,
        when clustering analysis was performed, patients with tumors featuring low
        levels of p16, cyclin D1 and p53 with concomitantly high levels of pRB had
        reduced risk for relapse (Wald''s p=0.015).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe p53-mediated
        sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents appears to be
        driven mostly by pRB. Using agents that enhance RB phosphorylation might possibly
        increase the chemosensitivity of breast cancer cells.", "venue": "Anticancer

        Genotype and Phenotype Parameters in Triple-negative Breast Cancers.", "abstract":
        "BACKGROUND\nEpidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) aberrations have been
        implicated in the pathogenesis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) but
        their impact on prognosis and, therefore, druggability, remain controversial.
        Herein, we studied EGFR aberrations at different molecular levels and assessed
        their prognostic impact in patients with operable TNBC treated with adjuvant
        anthracycline-based chemotherapy.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe evaluated
        the prognostic impact of EGFR gene status by fluorescent in situ hybridization
        (FISH), EGFR coding mutations by Sanger and next-generation sequencing, relative
        EGFR messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by qPCR (upper quartile) and EGFR and p53
        protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), in 352 centrally-assessed
        tumors from an equal number of TNBC patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nApproximately
        53.5% of the tumors expressed EGFR, 59.3% p53 and 35.9% both EGFR and p53
        proteins; 4.1% showed EGFR gene amplification and 4.4% carried EGFR mutations.
        The latter were located outside the druggable kinase domain region and presented
        at low frequencies. Amplification and mutations overlapped only in one case
        of glycogen-rich carcinoma. EGFR and CEN7 copies were higher in tumors from
        older patients (p=0.002 and p=0.003, respectively). Patients with amplified
        tumors (n=11) had excellent prognosis (0 relapses and deaths). Upon multivariate
        analysis, high EGFR copies conferred significantly favorable disease-free
        survival (HR=0.57, 95% CI 0.36-0.90, Wald''s p=0.017) and high CEN7 copies
        favorable overall survival (HR=0.49, 95% CI=0.29-0.83, Wald''s p=0.008). Patients
        with EGFR-/p53+ and EGFR+/p53- tumors had significantly higher risk for relapse
        than those with EGFR-/p53- and EGFR+/p53+ tumors (HR=1.73, 95% CI=1.12-2.67,
        Wald''s p=0.013).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nEGFR gene amplification and mutations are
        rare in TNBC, the latter of no apparent clinical relevance. Surrogate markers
        of EGFR-related chromosomal aberrations and combined EGFR/p53 IHC phenotypes
        appear to be associated with favorable prognosis in patients with operable
        TNBC receiving conventional adjuvant chemotherapy.", "venue": "Cancer Genomics

        Treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) remains one of the most
        challenging subtypes to treat because of the lack of specific therapies. In
        addition to the evaluation of platinum in the preoperative setting, studies
        in the metastatic setting further support that platinum may be active in metastatic
        TNBC. Another novel mitotic inhibitor currently being studied in this setting
        is eribulin.The aim of this Phase 2 study was to assess efficacy and safety
        of eribulin in combination with carboplatin as first-line therapy for locally
        recurrent or metastatic TNBC. Methods: Eligible patients were females with
        TNBC who had received one previous chemotherapy regimen in adjuvant setting

        Operable Triple-Negative Breast Cancer in Combination with Mutated Amino Acid
        Classes", "abstract": "Background Stromal tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)
        density is an outcome predictor in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Herein
        we asked whether TILs are related to coding mutation load and to the chemical
        class of the resulting mutated amino acids, i.e., charged, polar, and hydrophobic
        mutations. Methods We examined paraffin tumors from TNBC patients who had
        been treated with adjuvant chemotherapy mostly within clinical trials (training
        cohort, N = 133; validation, N = 190) for phenotype concordance; TILs density;
        mutation load and types. Results Concordance of TNBC phenotypes was 42.1%
        upon local / central, and 72% upon central / central pathology assessment.
        TILs were not associated with mutation load, type and class of mutated amino
        acids. Polar and charged mutation patterns differed between TP53 and PIK3CA
        (p<0.001). Hydrophobic mutations predicted for early relapse in patients with
        high nodal burden and <50% TILs tumors (training: HR 3.03, 95%CI 1.11\u20138.29,
        p = 0.031; validation: HR 2.90, 95%CI 0.97\u20138.70, p = 0.057), especially
        if compared to patients with >50% TILs tumors (training p = 0.003; validation
        p = 0.015). Conclusions TILs density is unrelated to mutation load in TNBC,
        which may be regarded as an unstable phenotype. If further validated, hydrophobic
        mutations along with TILs density may help identifying TNBC patients in higher
        risk for relapse.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 47,

        is a rare entity which is often causally related to infection by the Human
        Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Despite its predilection for oral cavity involvement,
        multiple cases of extra-oral involvement have been reported in the literature,
        more often among immunocompetent individuals.\n\n\nCASE REPORT\nHerein we
        present the first case of primary PBL of the breast in an otherwise immunocompetent
        36-year-old woman who was successfully treated with consolidation megatherapy
        and autologous stem cell transplantation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPBL carries a particularly
        poor prognosis and more intensive treatment is usually warranted. However,
        no treatment guidelines exist and treatment choices are made based on case
        reports and small retrospective case series.", "venue": "Anticancer Research",

        literature review was performed based on database search in PubMed/Medline
        and included articles up to August 2013.\n\n\nRESULTS\nBPs can reduce, delay,
        and prevent complications related to bone metastases. They improve mobility,
        functionality, pain, and quality of life. They limit survival of any inactive
        cancer cells in the microenvironment of the bone marrow, contributing to their
        death from anti-neoplastic treatments. Moreover, they limit and delay bone
        morbidity due to osteoporosis related to hormonotherapy in breast and prostate
        cancer. Finally, benefits can be derived from the combination of BPs with
        radiotherapy in bone density, recalcification, opioid use, and patient''s

        "title": "Prevalence of BRCA1 Mutations in Familial and Sporadic Greek Ovarian
        Cancer Cases", "abstract": "Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes
        contribute to approximately 18% of hereditary ovarian cancers conferring an
        estimated lifetime risk from 15% to 50%. A variable incidence of mutations
        has been reported for these genes in ovarian cancer cases from different populations.
        In Greece, six mutations in BRCA1 account for 63% of all mutations detected
        in both BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This study aimed to determine the prevalence
        of BRCA1 mutations in a Greek cohort of 106 familial ovarian cancer patients
        that had strong family history or metachronous breast cancer and 592 sporadic
        ovarian cancer cases. All 698 patients were screened for the six recurrent
        Greek mutations (including founder mutations c.5266dupC, p.G1738R and the
        three large deletions of exon 20, exons 23\u201324 and exon 24). In familial
        cases, the BRCA1 gene was consequently screened for exons 5, 11, 12, 20, 21,
        22, 23, 24. A deleterious BRCA1 mutation was found in 43/106 (40.6%) of familial
        cancer cases and in 27/592 (4.6%) of sporadic cases. The variant of unknown
        clinical significance p.V1833M was identified in 9/698 patients (1.3%). The
        majority of BRCA1 carriers (71.2%) presented a high-grade serous phenotype.
        Identifying a mutation in the BRCA1 gene among breast and/or ovarian cancer
        families is important, as it enables carriers to take preventive measures.
        All ovarian cancer patients with a serous phenotype should be considered for
        genetic testing. Further studies are warranted to determine the prevalence
        of mutations in the rest of the BRCA1 gene, in the BRCA2 gene, and other novel
        predisposing genes for breast and ovarian cancer.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year":

        A Matched Case-Case Study", "abstract": "Background: Significant controversy
        exists in the literature regarding the role of pregnancy in the prognosis
        of breast cancer. We designed a matched case-case study, matching pregnancy-associated
        breast cancer (PABC) cases with breast cancer cases for stage, age, and year
        of diagnosis. Patients and Methods: 39 consecutive cases of PABC were matched
        with 39 premenopausal cases of breast cancer. Univariate and multivariate
        survival analyses followed by adjustment for stage, grade, estrogen receptor
        status, and age at diagnosis, were performed. Results: Regarding overall survival
        (OS), univariate analysis pointed to longer OS in non-PABC cases vs. PABC
        cases. Accordingly, a more advanced stage predicted shorter survival. In the
        multivariate analysis, the independent aggravating effect mediated by pregnancy
        persisted. Interestingly, a post hoc nested analysis within PABC cases indicated
        that the 3rd trimester pointed to shorter OS. The aforementioned results on
        OS were also replicated during the examination of relapse-free survival. Conclusion:
        Implementing a matched case-case design, the present study points to pregnancy
        as a poor prognostic factor for breast cancer.", "venue": "Breast Care", "year":

        A Systematic Review", "abstract": "Abstract Pancreatic cancer is the fourth
        leading cause of cancer-related death. Most patients present with an advanced
        stage of disease that has a dismal outcome, with a median survival of approximately
        6 months. Evidently, there is a clear need for the development of new agents
        with novel mechanisms of action in this disease. A number of biological agents
        modulating different signal transduction pathways are currently in clinical
        development, inhibiting angiogenesis and targeting epidermal growth factor
        receptor, cell cycle, matrix metalloproteinases, cyclooxygenase-2, mammalian
        target of rapamycin, or proteasome. This is the first systematic review of
        the literature to synthesize all available data coming from trials and evaluate
        the efficacy and safety of molecular targeted drugs in unresectable and metastatic
        pancreatic cancer. However, it should be stressed that although multiple agents
        have been tested, only 9 phase 3 trials have been conducted and one agent
        (erlotinib) has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use
        in clinical practice. As knowledge accumulates on the molecular mechanisms
        underlying carcinogenesis in the pancreas, the anticipated development and

        To evaluate breast cancer characteristics in women aged 25 years and younger.
        METHODS: This was a retrospective, nested, within-cases matched study. The
        study design was based on a two-phase protocol. In the first phase, stage,
        grade, histologic subtype, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human
        epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status were compared between 28 patients
        (aged 25 years and younger) and 685 older premenopausal women (aged older
        than 25 years) with breast cancer. The second phase aimed to determine whether
        young patients exhibited worse prognosis when compared with older premenopausal
        women. RESULTS: Young patients presented at a more advanced stage (P=.012)
        and exhibited a higher grade (P=.018). No significant differences were noted
        regarding histologic subtype, estrogen receptor, and progesterone receptor
        status. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations was performed in 12
        of 28 young patients and mutations were found in 25% of them. Moreover, young
        women presented poorer overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 4.30, 95% confidence
        interval [CI] 1.09\u201317.03) than their older counterparts, matched by histologic
        subtype, stage, and grade; a similar pattern was noted regarding relapse-free
        survival (HR 8.28, 95% CI 2.24\u201330.60). CONCLUSION: Breast cancer diagnosis
        in women aged 25 years and younger is uncommon; however, these patients present
        at a more advanced stage, with a higher grade, and exhibit poorer survival.

        Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a novel solvent-free
        formulation of paclitaxel. It demonstrates several practical advantages over
        paclitaxel, including a shorter infusion time, no need for premedication and
        endogenous albumin transport to concentrate paclitaxel within the tumor cells.
        A pivotal phase III study demonstrated superior efficacy and less toxicity
        of nab-paclitaxel in comparison to the traditional solvent containing paclitaxel
        as second-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer patients. Furthermore,
        in a randomized phase II study, nab-paclitaxel has shown clinical benefit
        versus docetaxel as first-line treatment in metastatic breast cancer and based
        on the results of this trial recently gained approval as single-agent therapy
        in this setting. In addition, many small phase II studies have shown that
        nab-paclitaxel is effective in the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant setting when
        combined with other cytotoxic or biological agents. These data are summarized

        Cervical Cancer: Platinum Combinations, Non-Platinum-Containing Regimens,

        and early detection strategies, squamous-cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix
        is still diagnosed as locally advanced disease in a considerable proportion
        of patients. As a potent sensitizer of cancer cells, cisplatin has been the
        \u201ctraditional partner\u201d of external beam irradiation in this setting
        for more than two decades. Induction chemotherapy strategies followed by concurrent
        chemoradiation or surgery and preoperative concurrent chemoradiation have
        been recently implemented in clinical trials in an effort to optimize local
        control and to minimize the risk of distant metastases. In this context, cisplatin
        has been combined with a number of other potential radiosensitizers, including
        5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and gemcitabine. In patients resistant or intolerant
        to platinum compounds, numerous non-platinum-containing regimens have been
        developed, implementing various antimetabolites, taxanes, antineoplastic antibiotics,
        and topoisomerase II inhibitors. More recently, molecular agents targeting
        critical pathways in cervical malignant transformation are being assessed
        in early clinical trials in combination with external-beam irradiation. In
        the current work, we review the evolving role of cisplatin and other platinum
        compounds, either alone or in combination regimens, in the context of other
        potent radiosensitizers. The emerging role of molecular targeted agents, as
        candidate partners of external beam irradiation, is also discussed.", "venue":

        "5033 Background: The combination of carboplatin/paclitaxel represents the
        standard 1st-line chemotherapy in advanced OC, FC, and PPC. The optimal duration
        of paclitaxel treatment has not been defined, while its use is associated
        with cumulative neurotoxicity in about 50% of patients, which becomes long-term
        in 15-20% of cases. We, therefore, designed a randomized study to investigate
        the effect of administering 4 instead of 8 cycles of paclitaxel in the combination
        carboplatin/paclitaxel on efficacy and tolerability of this treatment. Methods:
        Patients with FIGO stages IIC-IV OC, FC, PPC were included. Carboplatin AUC
        6 and paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 were used. Both agents were administered for
        8 cycles in the CP8 arm, while paclitaxel was administered only for 4 cycles
        in the C8P4. The study was powered to detect a \u00b1 15% difference in survival
        rate to a baseline rate of 50 % at the 3-year time point. Results: 389 pts
        were randomized (2/2004-1/2008) and 380 were eligible for analysis (CP8: 192,

        may have a high percentage of residual disease after chemotherapy. It is questionable
        whether second or more lines of chemotherapy are needed in patients with slow-growing
        residual disease. In the present trial we compared the median survival of
        patients with residual or recurrent disease who received 1-2 lines of chemotherapy
        with those who received 3-9 lines.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwo hundred and five patients
        with advanced stage IIIA, B, C and IV ovarian cancer were divided into two
        groups based on the number of chemotherapy lines they received. All patients
        had prior first-line chemotherapy; the criteria for recruitment in the study
        were: a) residual or recurrent disease and b) failure to respond to first-line
        therapy. Group A included patients who received 1 or 2 lines of chemotherapy
        and group B, 3-9 lines.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe median survival of group A was 76

        "title": "Heat Shock Protein 90 (Hsp90) Expression and Breast Cancer", "abstract":
        "Hsp90 is an abundant protein in mammalian cells. It forms several discrete
        complexes, each containing distinct groups of co-chaperones that assist protein
        folding and refolding during stress, protein transport and degradation. It
        interacts with a variety of proteins that play key roles in breast neoplasia
        including estrogen receptors, tumor suppressor p53 protein, angiogenesis transcription
        factor HIF-1alpha, antiapoptotic kinase Akt, Raf-1 MAP kinase and a variety
        of receptor tyrosine kinases of the erbB family. Elevated Hsp90 expression
        has been documented in breast ductal carcinomas contributing to the proliferative
        activity of breast cancer cells; whilst a significantly decreased Hsp90 expression
        has been shown in infiltrative lobular carcinomas and lobular neoplasia. Hsp90
        overexpression has been proposed as a component of a mechanism through which
        breast cancer cells become resistant to various stress stimuli. Therefore,
        pharmacological inhibition of HSPs can provide therapeutic opportunities in
        the field of cancer treatment. 17-allylamino,17-demethoxygeldanamycin is the
        first Hsp90 inhibitor that has clinically been investigated in phase II trial,
        yielding promising results in patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic
        breast cancer, whilst other Hsp90 inhibitors (retaspimycin HCL, NVP-AUY922,
        NVP-BEP800, CNF2024/BIIB021, SNX-5422, STA-9090, etc.) are currently under

        either vinorelbine or capecitabine as first- and second-line therapy for ErbB2-overexpressing
        metastatic breast cancer (MBC)", "abstract": "Background: Lapatinib (L), a
        dual kinase inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor and ErbB2, is effective
        in the treatment of ErbB2+ MBC in combination with capecitabine (C) following
        progression after trastuzumab, anthracyclines, and taxanes. Vinorelbine (V)
        is an important chemotherapy option in MBC, and multiple Phase II trials have
        been conducted in combination with trastuzumab. This randomized, open-label,
        multicenter, Phase II study (LAP112620, VITAL) evaluated the efficacy and
        safety of L with either V or C in women with ErbB2+ MBC. Methods: Patients
        with MBC who had received \u22641 chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting
        were randomized 2:1 to either L 1250 mg orally once daily (QD) continuously
        plus V 20 mg/m2 intravenously on Days 1 and 8, every third week, or L 1250
        mg orally QD continuously plus C 2000 mg/m2/day orally in 2 doses 12 hours
        apart on Days 1\u201314 every third week. Patients were stratified by prior
        receipt of therapy for MBC (Y/N) and site of metastatic disease (visceral/soft
        tissue or bone-only). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS)
        was assessed once all subjects had been followed for a minimum of 6 months
        or had otherwise progressed, died or withdrawn, if sooner. The primary focus
        was to evaluate PFS in the L plus V arm with a descriptive intent only. Other
        endpoints included overall response rate, overall survival, and safety. Patients
        progressing on one treatment arm were given the option of crossing over to
        the other arm. Results: 112 patients were randomized. The results and conclusions
        sections will be updated once the primary analysis has been completed in September

        "title": "A Woman with Breast Cancer and Severe Impaired Lactose Tolerance:
        An Intriguing Therapeutic Dilemma", "abstract": "To the Editor: A variety
        of prognostic and predictive factors influence the treatment of localized
        breast cancer since they have a bearing on both prognosis and selection of
        adjuvant treatment, one of which is the hormone receptor status. Hormonal
        therapy is directed toward inhibiting estrogen from stimulating the growth
        of cancer cells that require estrogen to proliferate. Given that hormone receptor
        (ER and \u2044 or PR)-positive breast cancer requires estrogen to grow, hormonal
        therapy is effective in hormone receptor-positive breast cases. Data from
        the Early Breast Cancer Trialists\u2019 Collaborative Group (1), as well from
        several randomized clinical trials of postmenopausal women with localized
        hormone receptorpositive breast cancer have shown that adjuvant use of aromatase
        inhibitors (anastrazole, letrozole, examestane) and tamoxifen reduces the
        annual risk of breast cancer recurrence by more than 40% and decreases the
        annual risk of death by more than 35% (2\u20135). Therefore, it is crucial
        that women with hormone receptor (ER and \u2044 or PR)-positive breast cancer
        take hormonal treatment, i.e., tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor. Herein,
        we report a really unusual case of a 50year-old postmenopausal woman with
        infiltrative lobular carcinoma. The woman had undergone extensive lumpectomy
        with axillary lymph node dissection, which revealed an infiltrative lobular
        carcinoma measuring 3.5 cm in its greatest diameter with 13 \u2044 28 lymph
        nodes infiltrate, according to the TNM system as T2N3M0. Immunohistochemical
        examination disclosed a high expression of estrogen receptors (ER: 100%+++)
        whereas progesterone and HER-2 \u2044 neu expression was negative. Imaging
        studies did not locate metastatic disease. Regarding breast cancer treatment,
        the patient underwent irradiation therapy to the remnant breast, received
        chemotherapy and was prescribed 1 mg of oral anastrazole daily. However, from
        the first day of treatment the woman experienced grade 3 diarrheas; letrozole
        (2.5 mg), examestane (25 mg), and tamoxifen (20 mg daily) were used, none
        of which the woman could tolerate at all. More detailed medical history revealed
        that the woman had impaired lactose tolerance. Given the necessity for the
        woman to receive hormonal treatment, fulvestrant 500 mg represents an alternative.
        Fulvestrant is an R antagonist which, unlike SERMs, has no known agonist effect
        and downregulates the ER protein (6). It should mentioned that this drug has
        no indication in the adjuvant setting. But, in two global phase III clinical
        trials fulvestrant proved to be at least as effective and as equally well
        tolerated as anastrazole for the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced
        and metastatic breast cancer. Taking into consideration that fulvestrant has
        no lactose excipient and the fact that it is given i.m and not per os, one
        could consider fulvestrant as an attractive option. Severe impaired lactose
        tolerance is quite a rare condition; in such cases, aromatase inhibitors as
        well as tamoxifen are not usually well tolerated. Given the benefit of hormonal
        treatment to these women, fulvestrant should always be considered as an alternative
        option.", "venue": "The Breast Journal", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 7,

        Number of Febrile Episodes in Myeloma Patients Who Undergo High Dose Melphalan
        with Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Do Not Receive
        Antibiotic Prophylaxis", "abstract": "Abstract 4457 Patients with multiple
        myeloma (MM) are at a higher risk of infections compared to general population.
        High dose melphalan (HDM) with autologous stem cell support (ASCT) is the
        recommended treatment for MM patients \u226465 years of age. Up to 80% of
        patients who undergo an ASCT develop neutropenic fever and up to one third
        of them have culture positive infections. The mannan binding leptin (MBL)
        pathway of the complement system is part of the innate immune system and seems
        to influence the risk of infections in cancer patients during treatment. In
        contrast to the classical complement pathway, MBL pathway is not antibody-dependent.
        MBL is a protein that belongs to the collectin family and is produced by hepatocytes.
        MBL acts via binding to the surface of bacteria, thus facilitating complement
        activation with formation of the membrane attack complex, leading to microbial
        lysis. In general population, 15\u201320% of people have MBL levels We studied
        100 MM patients who underwent an ASCT between 1996\u20132011 in a single center
        (Department of Clinical Therapeutics, University of Athens, Greece). All patients
        received prophylactic therapy with 200 mg fluconazole daily and 500 mg valacyclovir
        daily. Sixty-seven patients participated in a randomized study, where in the
        first arm patients received prophylactic antibiotics, including vancomycin
        at a dosage of 1 g once daily and ciprofloxacin at a dosage of 400 mg twice
        daily, while in the arm B there was no antibiotic prophylaxis. All patients
        received G-CSF 300 \u03bc g twice daily from day of stem cell reinfusion to
        neutrophil counts >1500/mm3. In case of neutropenic fever, prophylactic antibiotics
        were interrupted and first line regimen was administered, including vancomycin
        1g twice daily, amikacin 500 mg twice daily and ceftazidime 2 g TID. In case
        of failure of first line treatment, a second line antibiotic combination was
        administered, usually including a carbapenem and linezolide. Antibiotic regimens
        were also modified according to results of blood or urine cultures. MBL serum
        levels were measured in all patients on the day of mobilization, before the
        administration of cyclophosphamide, using an ELISA methodology (RD p=0.05).
        The results of our study suggests that myeloma patients who underwent ASCT
        and had low levels of MBL had a lower response rate in first line antibiotic
        regimens, requiring more often administration of a second more advanced line
        of antibiotics. Furthermore, the administration of prophylactic antibiotics
        to these patients seems to reduce the number of febrile episodes. These observations
        underscores the importance of innate immune system in permitting antibiotics
        to exercise their protective effect in severely immunocompromised patients
        and raise the question about the necessity of administering prophylactic antibiotics
        in this subgroup of patients. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest

        it with the expression of p53, bcl-2 and bax.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTumor
        samples from 60 patients with EOC were immunohistochemically investigated
        for the expression of ERCC1, p53, bcl-2 and bax.\n\n\nRESULTS\nERCC-1 expression
        was significantly decreased in serous and endometrioid compared to clear cell
        carcinomas. P53 expression was significantly increased in serous compared
        to clear cell carcinomas. Bax expression was significantly increased in serous
        carcinomas as compared to MMTs. High disease stage was correlated with low

        "Case Report A 46-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of anemia
        and thrombocytopenia. Seven years before admission, she was diagnosed with
        epithelia ovarian cancer (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
        stage IIIC) and was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
        and omentectomy (suboptimal debulking) followed by six courses of paclitaxel
        and carboplatin (total dose 1,800 mg and 4,500 mg, respectively), which resulted
        in a complete clinical response. Three months after chemotherapy she underwent
        an autologous transplantation using cyclophosphamide (4 g/m) and granulocyte
        colony-stimulating factors for mobilization and high-dose melphalan (180 mg/m)
        as conditioning regimen. Until recently, she was without evidence of disease.
        On admission her peripheral blood count status was as follows: hemoglobin
        8 g/dL, WBCs 7.4 10/L (2% blasts, 62% neutrophils, 32% lymphocytes, 4% monocytes),
        and platelets 81 10/L. A bone marrow aspiration revealed hypercellularity,
        20% blasts (Fig 1, black arrows) with Auer bodies and congregations of ovarian
        cancer cells (large epithelial cells with multiple nuclei and basophilic cytoplasm;
        Figs 1 and 2, white arrows). Immunophenotyping and flow cytometric analysis
        revealed that the blasts expressed myeloid antigens CD34, CD33, and CD117.
        Immunochemistry on trephine biopsy specimen recorded bone marrow infiltration
        by cells of epithelial origin. Conventional chromosome analysis showed a complex
        hypodiploid karyotype with monosomy 5, 18, and 21 (44 45, XX, 1, 5, 18, 21,
        add[21][p11], r, 3mar). CA125 was raised to abnormal levels, whereas chest
        and abdominal computed tomography scans did not show any lesions. A diagnosis
        of acute myeloid leukemia (AML; WHO classification) and concurrent ovarian
        cancer relapse with bone marrow infiltration was made. An AML-oriented chemotherapy
        with idarubicin (12 mg/m/d for 3 days) and cytarabine (200 mg/m/d for 7 days)
        was initiated. The disease proved to be refractory to chemotherapy and the
        patient died 6 months later, despite the administration of high-dose cytarabine
        (3 g/m for 3 days) as salvage therapy.", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Oncology",

        have shown that bevacizumab combined with taxane-based regimens increases
        response rates and prolongs progression-free survival (PFS) of patients with
        metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However predictive or prognostic biological
        markers that identify the appropriate target population, thus improving the
        cost-effectiveness ratio of this treatment, are still needed.\n\n\nPATIENTS
        AND METHODS\nRetrospectively, 124 patients with MBC treated either with paclitaxel
        90 mg/m\u00b2 weekly x12 plus bevacizumab 10 \u03bcg/kg every 2 weeks or 15
        \u03bcg/kg every 3 weeks (85 patients) or paclitaxel 175 mg/m\u00b2 plus bevacizumab
        15 \u03bcg/kg every 3 weeks for 6 cycles (36 patients) were identified. Additionally,
        the prognostic significance of a panel of key biological markers was evaluated
        centrally by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 88 evaluable patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMore
        than two thirds of the patients completed chemotherapy, as planned. The response
        rate was almost identical (55.3% vs. 55.6%) in the patients treated with weekly
        or 3-weekly paclitaxel, respectively. After a median follow-up time of 23
        months, the median PFS of the study population was 13 months, while median
        survival had not yet been reached. Common severe adverse events were neutropenia
        (33%), neuropathy (18.6%) and metabolic disturbances (17.6%). The incidence
        of hypertension of all grades was 28.1%. High expression of vascular endothelial
        growth factor (VEGF) receptor 3 (VEGFR3) was associated with clinical response,
        while high expression of VEGFR1 was associated with poor survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe

        Optia v5.0: A Single Center Experience with An Automatic Interface-Controlled
        Apheresis System", "abstract": "Abstract 4396 Available manual apheresis systems
        generally produce stem cell yields of consistently high quality that can be
        safely used for autologous transplantation. However, manual apheresis needs
        continuous interface monitoring/adjustement, suffers from interface instability
        in poor mobilizers, high collection variability, high platelet loss and failure
        to electronically document parameters. A new advanced apheresis system, Spectra
        Optia v5.0, featuring optical sensors, which provide real time automatic interface
        and product line control, was designed to override these disadvantages. In
        our study, we evaluated data of 10 stem cell leukaphereses performed in 8
        patients with various malignancies using Spectra Optia during 2011 to test
        its feasibility and effectiveness. We compared our data with those obtained
        from 225 patients that had undergone a stem cell collection for autologous
        transplantation in our Department between 2004 and 2011, using the COBE Spectra
        machine. The use and function of automatic interface control of Spectra were
        satisfactory. Due to the application of lower inlet volumes/min, as compared
        to corresponding volumes with the COBE Spectra machine, our apheresis with
        Spectra Optia usually took a longer time (median 447 min versus 317 min, p
        500/\u03bcl, neutrophil counts >1500/\u03bcl did not significantly differ
        (10 days versus 9 days, p=0.386 and 11 days versus 10 days, p=0.229, respectively).
        However a delay in platelet recovery with Optia device need to be confirmed
        with additional data from apheresis procedures (median time to platelet counts
        >25000/\u03bcl was 12 days versus 11 days for COBE Spectra, respectively;
        p=0.037). Platelet loss with Optia was less than with COBE Spectra (1278 versus
        2415 \u00d7 103/\u03bcl, p=0.014). No significant differences were observed
        for product hematocrit between Optia and COBE Spectra (5.7% versus 6.6%, p=0.392).
        In conclusion, the automatic Spectra Optia aphereses were associated with
        similar and equally variable stem cell collections as aphereses with COBE
        Spectra. Further data are needed to clarify the potential benefit of lower
        platelet loss using Optia. We continue to use this procedure in our center
        and updated results will be presented in the meeting. Disclosures: No relevant

        "Sarcomas of the fallopian tube are exceedingly rare malignancies. They have
        been considered the most lethal of all gynaecological malignancies with high
        metastatic potential, frequent recurrences and cancer-related deaths. The
        reported pathological types of the fallopian tube sarcomas are malignant mixed
        mullerian (mesodermal) tumours or carcinosarcomas, leiomyosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas,
        liposarcomas, and synovial sarcomas. The rarity of these sarcomas and their
        often aggressive clinical course has resulted in a relatively limited amount
        of literature. Thus a single hospital or specialist cannot gain sufficient
        experience with these tumours. This review article tries to elucidate this
        uncommon malignancy, in a systematic way, focusing on the different pathological
        types, epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, survival, and different therapeutic
        modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy).", "venue": "Oncology

        in high-risk patients treated with dose-dense sequential adjuvant chemotherapy.",
        "abstract": "e21110 Background: It is well recognized that breast cancer is
        a heterogeneous disease that is composed of several molecular subtypes with
        substantial differences in growth rate, invasiveness and treatment response.
        Estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PgR) and HER2 are important
        determinants of these molecular subtypes, since they drive specific targeted
        treatments, such as antiestrogens, aromatase inhibitors and trastuzumab.\n\n\nMETHODS\n595
        patients with high-risk breast cancer were treated with adjuvant anthracycline-based
        dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with or without paclitaxel (E-T-CMF vs.
        E-CMF) in the context of a randomized Phase III study. ER, PgR, HER2, Ki67,
        EGFR, and CK5 were evaluated in 298 formalin-fixed tumor samples by immunohistochemistry
        (IHC). HER2 was also evaluated by chromogen in situ hybridization (CISH) using
        ZYMED (InVitrogen) technology and was used to determine HER2 status for patients
        that had a score different than +3 by IHC. Identification of the immunophenotypic
        subtypes was based initially on ER and PgR protein expression. HER2 status
        and Ki67 protein expression differentiated luminal subtypes (luminal A tumors
        being HER2- and Ki67-negative), while EGFR and CK5 protein overexpression
        identified basal-like tumors.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAmong the 298 tumors, the immunohistochemical
        panel classified 37 (12%) as luminal A, 198 (66%) as luminal B, 27 (9%) as
        HER2-enriched, and 36 (12%) as triple-negative breast cancer. In the latter
        group there were 25 tumors (69%) that expressed EGFR and/or CK5 (basal-like
        tumors). Patients with luminal A tumors had the best prognosis, with improved
        DFS (log-rank, p=0.033) and OS (p=0.006) compared to the other three tumor
        subtypes. No benefit from paclitaxel treatment was detected in any of the
        four subtypes. Evaluation of ER, PgR and HER2 mRNA expression using RT-PCR
        will also be used for identification of triple-negative disease in the same
        cohort.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe results of this study confirm that immunophenotypic
        classification of breast cancer is of prognostic value, without benefit however
        being detected in our cohort from paclitaxel treatment in any of the four
        tumor subtypes.", "venue": "Journal of Clinical Oncology", "year": 2011, "referenceCount":

        "title": "A phase II randomized trial of lapatinib with either vinorelbine
        or capecitabine as first- and second-line therapy for ErbB2-overexpressing
        metastatic breast cancer (MBC): Safety results.", "abstract": "e11097^ Background:
        Lapatinib (L), a dual kinase inhibitor of EGFR and ErbB2, is approved for
        the treatment of ErbB2+ MBC in combination with capecitabine (C) following
        progression after trastuzumab, anthracylines, and taxanes. Vinorelbine (V)
        is an important chemotherapy option in MBC, and multiple Phase II trials have
        been conducted in combination with trastuzumab.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThis randomized,
        open-label, multicentre, Phase II study (LAP112620, VITAL) is evaluating the
        efficacy and safety of L with either V or C in women with ErbB2+ MBC. 105
        patients with disease progression who have received \u22641 chemotherapy regimen
        in the metastatic setting are randomized 2:1 to either L 1250 mg orally once
        daily (QD) continuously plus V 20mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and 8, every
        third week, or L 1250 mg orally QD continuously plus C 2000 mg/m2/day orally
        in 2 doses 12 hours apart on days 1-14 every third week. The primary endpoint
        is progression-free survival. As initial dose-selection was based on 2 ongoing
        Phase I trials, an interim safety cohort (n=30) is employed with prospectively
        determined stopping rules for the L+V arm based on clinically-acceptable limits
        for febrile neutropenia (5%) and Grade (G) 4 neutropenia (20%). Utilizing
        95% confidence intervals (CI), these limits may be exceeded with 4 events
        in 20 patients (20%) for febrile neutropenia and 9 events in 20 (45%) patients
        for G4 neutropenia.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe safety cohort (n=20 LV arm + 10 LC arm)
        completed a minimum of 3 cycles. Median daily exposure to L was 1250mg vs
        1212mg in the LV and LC arm, respectively. 33% and 66% of patients received
        first-line vs second-line therapy, respectively, for MBC. Most common Grade
        3-5 toxicities (>10%) for LV vs LC arms were G3 neutropenia (10% vs 0%), G4
        neutropenia (10% vs 0%), G3 diarrhea (10% vs 20%), G3 leukopenia (10% vs 0%).
        In the LV arm, febrile neutropenia and G4 neutropenia were noted in 1 (5%)
        and 2 (10%) patients, respectively. The lower bounds of the 95% CI did not
        exceed the clinically acceptable thresholds.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe pre-planned
        interim safety analysis supports the current dose selection of L 1250mg +

        after trastuzumab, anthracyclines and taxanes. Vinorelbine (V) is an important

        II study (NCT01013740) evaluated the efficacy and safety of L with either
        V or C in women with HER2+ MBC. The analysis of progression-free survival
        (PFS) and safety showed comparable rates of efficacy and tolerability between
        the 2 arms (Janni et al, SABCS 2012). Here we report the results of the overall

        surgery in gynecologic oncology might be complicated by unsuspected side-effects
        for the patient. Experimental data suggest that the risk of tumor dissemination
        in the non traumatized peritoneum may be higher after pneumoperitoneum than
        after laparotomy, and they also show the importance of the surgeon''s experience
        and technique.\n\n\nCASES\nWe present two cases of uterine endometrial stromal
        tumors which were laparoscopically excised. In both cases, intraperitoneal
        tumor seedings were identified shortly after the initial operation. The first
        patient had a low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma and succumbed from the
        disease two years after the initial operation, while the second patient who
        was diagnosed with endometrial stromal tumor remains disease free two years
        later.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe laparoscopic excision of an endometrial stromal
        tumor might result in tumor dissemination into the abdominal cavity. A careful
        second-look examination of the abdomen or a radical surgical approach is proposed.",

        and aims Primary malignant peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare malignancy with
        an unfavorable prognosis. Pemetrexed has proven effective in the treatment
        of malignant mesothelioma, alone or in combination with platinum agents. In
        the present study, chemo-na\u00efve patients were evaluated for the efficacy
        and safety of the pemetrexed-cisplatin combination. Methods Six patients with
        diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma were treated with 6 cycles of pemetrexed (500
        mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2). Chemotherapy was administered on an outpatient
        basis every 3 weeks. Results Complete response was observed in 2 patients
        (33%) and partial response was observed in 3 patients (50%). The estimated
        median overall survival was 24 months and the estimated median time to disease
        progression was 9.5 months. The regimen was well tolerated. Conclusions Though
        our data reflect a small sample size, pemetrexed plus cisplatin accomplished
        a particularly high clinical benefit rate on chemo-na\u00efve patients. Free

        and solid tumors were randomly assigned to receive (Group A) or not (Group
        B) prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, orally, and vancomycin, intravenously.
        Prophylactic antibiotics were given from day 0 until resolution of neutropenia
        or the appearance of a febrile event. Furthermore, patients in both groups
        received once a day fluconazole, orally. The primary end\u2010point of our
        study was the incidence of neutropenic febrile episodes attributed to infection.
        One hundred and twelve (71.3%) patients developed neutropenic fever, 50 (56.2%)
        in Group A and 62 (91.2%) in Group B (P < 0.001) with the majority (82%) of
        patients developing fever of unknown origin. Patients on prophylactic antibiotics
        had a significantly lower rate of bacteremias (5.6%) than did those randomized
        to no prophylaxis (29.4%) (P = 0.005) and, when developing neutropenic fever,
        they had a lower probability of response to first\u2010line empirical antibiotics
        (P = 0.025). Prophylactic administration of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin reduced

        "title": "Reduced Repair Efficiency Correlates with Increased Cellular Chemosensitivity
        and Better Response to High Dose Melphalan of Patients with Multiple Myeloma",
        "abstract": "Abstract 2976 \n\nThe alkylating agent melphalan is one of the
        most active chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of patients with multiple
        myeloma (MM). It reacts with DNA, producing mostly N-alkylpurine monoadducts,
        a small proportion of which goes on to form interstrand cross-links, which
        play a major role in cytotoxicity. In this report, we investigated the molecular
        mechanisms of therapeutic action and drug resistance to alkylating drugs using
        melphalan as a model. We studied 12 healthy volunteers (7M/5F; median age
        41 years) and 32 MM patients (14M/18F; median age 59 years) who underwent
        high-dose melphalan (HDM) therapy with autologous stem cells transplantation
        (ASCT) as part of their first line therapy. These patients had measurable
        monoclonal protein in serum and/or urine after induction treatment so that
        further response after HDM could be assessed. Twenty-three patients achieved
        a further reduction of monoclonal protein after ACST (responders) and 9 patients
        did not (non responders). Blood samples were obtained from the healthy volunteers
        and the patients, within 1 week prior to ASCT and at least 1 month after exposure
        to any anti-myeloma treatment. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
        were isolated and treated with 10 \u03bc g/mL of melphalan for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.
        Three molecular end-points (chromatin condensation, transcription activity,
        melphalan-induced DNA damage formation/repair) were measured in four genomic
        loci (beta-actin, p53, N-ras and delta-globin genes). Furthermore, accumulation
        of p53 protein, recovery of both total RNA and poly(A) mRNA synthesis as well
        as induction of apoptosis were also studied. In all subjects, beta-actin,
        p53 and N-ras genes were transcriptionally active. Importantly, delta-globin
        gene was silent in all healthy volunteers, while an induction of the transcription
        activity of this gene was found in 90% of MM patients (29/32). In all subjects,
        more relaxed chromatin structure and faster repair were observed in regions
        inside beta-actin, p53 and N-ras genes, compared to regions on both sides
        of the genes, while for delta-globin such a difference was observed only in
        MM patients. In all subjects, 5\u2032- to 3\u2032-end gradients of chromatin
        condensation and repair efficiency were observed along the transcribed strand
        of the active genes, with higher looseness of chromatin structure and faster
        repair at the 5\u2032-end. Interestingly, inside all genes analyzed, repair
        was slower in responders relative to non-responders, the difference being
        greater and statistically significant at the 5\u2032-end (p<0.003). PBMCs
        from all healthy volunteers showed evidence of p53 protein accumulation at
        doses as low as 10\u03bc g/ml melphalan, responders at 75\u03bc g/ml, while
        non-responders required doses of at least 100\u03bc g/ml. These results suggest
        that cells with lower repairing activity and higher levels of residual adducts
        (i.e. PBMCs from healthy volunteers and responders) are more sensitive to
        melphalan-induced p53 accumulation than PBMCs from non-responders having higher
        levels of preferential repair. PBMCs from non-responders had almost fully
        recovered both poly(A) mRNA and total RNA synthesis to control levels by 6h
        following exposure to 100\u03bc g/ml melphalan. In contrast, PBMCs from all
        healthy volunteers and most responders (18/23) showed a more extensive and
        prolonged inhibition of RNA synthesis, suggesting that, following exposure
        to melphalan, the ability to preferentially repair the transcribed strand
        of the active genes correlates with a rapid recovery of both total RNA and
        poly(A) mRNA synthesis. Finally, significant differences in the induction
        of melphalan-induced apoptosis were found between PBMCs from responders and
        non-responders to therapeutic treatment. Induction of apoptosis was evident
        following 10\u03bc g/ml melphalan in all healthy volunteers, 75\u03bc g/ml
        in most responders (18/23) and at least 100\u03bc g/ml in non-responders,
        suggesting that PBMCs from healthy volunteers and responders to chemotherapy
        correlated with an increased susceptibility to melphalan-induced apoptosis.
        In conclusion, reduced repair efficiency of the transcribed strand of active
        genes in PBMCs from responders to chemotherapy correlated with an increased
        melphalan-induced cellular chemosensitivity and better response to chemotherapy
        for MM. This could lead to the identification of molecular markers to predict
        response to anti-myeloma therapies.\n\nDisclosures: No relevant conflicts

        cancer in western countries. Radiotherapy remains the mainstay of postoperative
        management, but accumulating data show that adjuvant chemotherapy may display
        promising results after staging surgery. The prognosis of patients with metastatic
        disease remains disappointing with only one-year survival. Progestins represent
        an effective option, especially for those patients with low-grade estrogen
        and/or progesterone receptor positive disease. Chemotherapy using the combination
        of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and cisplatin is beneficial for patients with

        with early-stage disease and high-risk factors. Toxicity is a point in question;
        however, the combination of paclitaxel with carboplatin may diminish these
        concerns. In women with multiple medical comorbidities, single-agent chemotherapy

        with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) participating in a randomised phase
        II study that compared the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan
        (IRI), fluorouracil (FU) with leucovorin (LV) (arm A) versus sequential chemotherapy
        with IRI plus FU/LV followed by oxaliplatin (OXA) plus FU/LV (arm B) as first
        line therapy.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nIntent-to-treat analysis was performed
        on 417 patients (211 in arm A and 206 in arm B). Treatment schedules of weekly
        IRI 80 mg/m(2) or OXA 45 mg/m(2) plus LV 200 mg/m(2) immediately followed
        by intravenous bolus FU 450 mg/m(2) for 6 weeks were followed by a 2-week
        rest period. Treatment continued for 4 cycles. Patients in arm A were treated
        with IRI/FU/LV for 4 cycles, while patients in arm B were initially treated
        with IRI/FU/LV for 2 cycles followed by sequential administration of 2 cycles
        of OXA/FU/LV.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo significant difference emerged in overall response
        rate or overall survival. There was a difference in progression-free survival
        (median, 7.3 versus 8.2 months, p=0.040) in favour of arm B. Toxicity profiles
        were similar in both arms.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIRI/FU/LV and IRI/FU/LV followed
        by OXA/FU/LV showed comparable activity with a manageable toxicity profile.",

        an intriguing diptych after benign breast biopsy", "abstract": "This study
        evaluates the effect of palpability upon breast self-examination (BSE) and
        adherence to annual mammogram after benign breast biopsy (BBB). Seven hundred
        and fifty-two women with palpable (WP, n\u2009=\u2009359) or nonpalpable (WNP,
        n\u2009=\u2009393) lesions were evaluated 2 years before and after BBB. BSE
        was considered adequate when it was performed at least once per month, and
        inadequate when it was performed with a frequency of less than once per month.
        Prebiopsy/postbiopsy adherence was characterized as inadequate when at least
        one session of mammographic examination was lost within the 2-prebiopsy/postbiopsy
        (including the last visit) years, respectively. The prebiopsy frequency of
        adequate BSE was higher in WP [49 (176 of 359) vs. 38.9% (153 of 393) for
        WNP; Pearson''s \u03c72 (1)\u2009=\u20097.77, P\u2009=\u20090.005]. However,
        the opposite happened regarding the prebiopsy adherence to mammogram, as the
        frequency of adequate adherence was 64.1% (252 of 393) in WNP, but only 46.0%
        (165 of 359) in WP. After BBB, adherence to mammogram significantly increased
        in both groups, reaching 76.1% (299 of 393) for WNP and 65.2% (234 of 359)
        for WP. However, BSE increased significantly only in WNP. Regarding the WP
        group, the postBBB BSE did not exhibit any significant change. Noticeably,
        the aforementioned increase in BSE among WNP resulted in the disappearance
        of the initial WP\u2013WNP discrepancy regarding BSE; the postBBB BSE did
        not differ between WP and WNP. However, concerning adherence to mammogram,
        the superiority of WNP versus WP persisted (76.1 vs. 65.2%, respectively).
        In conclusion WP and WNP may perceive BBB differently, as reflected upon the
        differentially modified patterns.", "venue": "European Journal of Cancer Prevention",

        "BACKGROUND\nWe undertook a randomized phase II trial to test whether the
        addition of paclitaxel (Taxol) to the cisplatin and ifosfamide (IP) combination
        could improve objective response (OR) rate, progression-free survival (PFS)
        and overall survival (OS) in patients with recurrent or metastatic cancer
        of the uterine cervix.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nOne hundred and fifty-three
        patients were randomly allocated to receive either the IP regimen (ifosfamide
        1.5 g/m(2), daily, on days 1-3 and cisplatin 70 mg/m(2) on day 2) or the same
        combination with the addition of paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) on day 1 [ifosfamide,
        paclitaxel and cisplatinum (ITP) regimen]. Cycles were administered every
        4 weeks on an outpatient basis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA modest increase in neurotoxicity
        was observed with the triplet combination. OR rate was significantly higher
        in the ITP group (59% versus 33%, P = 0.002). Median PFS was 7.9 and 6.3 months
        for patients in the ITP and IP arms, respectively (P = 0.023). Median OS was
        15.4 months and 13.2 months in the ITP and IP arms, respectively (P = 0.048).
        In multivariate analysis, the triplet yielded a hazard ratio of 0.70 for relapse
        or progression (P = 0.046) and 0.75 for death (P = 0.124) compared with the
        doublet.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe ITP combination merits further investigation

        Bone Formation and Angiogenesis.", "abstract": "Abstract 3863 Poster Board
        III-799 Bortezomib (V) monotherapy is associated with increased osteoblastic
        activity, reduced osteoclast function and decreased angiogenesis in relapsed/refractory
        myeloma (MM). The co-administration of zoledronic acid in all reported studies
        to-date may suggest a synergistic stimulation on osteoclast/osteoblast interactions
        by the two agents but has not allowed the independent evaluation of V on bone
        metabolism. Furthermore, the combination of V with other agents, such as thalidomide
        (T), melphalan (M) and dexamethasone (D), although it reduced osteoclast activity,
        it did not enhance osteoblast function. We evaluated the effect of VTD consolidation
        on bone metabolism and angiogenesis in MM patients who underwent high-dose
        M followed by ASCT. In this prospective study, only patients in first remission
        or with primary refractory disease to one frontline treatment were included.
        Patients did not receive any bisphosphonate during or post-ASCT as well as
        throughout the period of VTD consolidation. VTD started on day 100 after ASCT:
        V was administered at a dose of 1.0 mg/m 2 on days 1,4,8,11; T was given at
        a dose of 100 mg/day, po, on days 1-21 and D at a dose of 40 mg/day on days
        1\u20134 of a 21-day cycle. Patients received 4 cycles of VTD (first block),
        were followed without treatment for 100 days and then received another 4 cycles
        of VTD (2 nd block). Patients were assessed for skeletal-related events (SREs)
        throughout the period of the study (12 months). Bone remodeling was studied
        by the measurement of the following serum indices before and after each block
        of VTD (4 measurements for each patient): i) osteoclast regulators [sRANKL
        and osteoprotegerin (OPG)], ii) osteoblast inhibitor dickkopf-1 (Dkk-1), iii)
        bone resorption markers (CTX and TRACP-5b) and iv) bone formation markers
        [bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) and osteocalcin (OC)]. Angiogenic
        cytokines such as VEGF, angiogenin (ANG), angiopoietin (Angp)-1 and -2, and
        bFGF were also studied on the same dates. So far, 32 patients have completed
        the first block of VTD, while 16 patients have completed both VTD blocks.
        Just before VDT administration, 10 patients were in CR (4 in sCR), 14 in vgPR
        and 8 in PR. Although most of these patients were rated as vgPR or better,
        they had increased serum levels of sRANKL (p=0.037), Dkk-1 (p=0.001), CTX
        (p=0.002), TRACP-5b (p nd (p=0.008) but was reduced after the 2 nd block of
        VTD (p=0.037). OC had no further alterations, while bALP was increased before
        the 2 nd block of VTD (p=0.012) and showed no changes thereafter. VEGF, ANG,
        and Angp-1/Angp-2 were increased during the resting period between the two
        VTD blocks and remained unchanged thereafter. During the study period, only
        one patient developed a SRE (i.e. radiation to bone). As of July 2009, 8 of
        32 patients have developed progressive disease. The median TTP after ASCT
        was 27 months (CI 95% 16.3-37.6). The results of this ongoing study suggest
        that VTD consolidation post-ASCT, without the presence of bisphosphonates,
        reduces RANKL and bone resorption and is associated with a very low incidence
        of SREs. However, bortezomib was not able to produce a significant anabolic
        effect on bones when combined with TD even in these patients with low myeloma
        burden, while its effect on angiogenic cytokines was modest. Disclosures:

        fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is a rare malignancy with only few data existing
        on the impact of prognostic factors.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed
        26 patients. Tissue blocks were reviewed and sections were stained for vascular
        endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 (MMP-2,
        MMP-9), tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 (TIMP-1, TIMP-2),

        Board III-222 High dose melphalan (HDM) with autologous stem cell transplantation
        (ASCT) is the standard of care for eligible patients with multiple myeloma
        (MM) aged up to 65 years. This procedure is accompanied by a high incidence
        of neutropenic fever and infections that represent a leading cause of morbidity
        in these patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of prophylactic
        antibiotic administration after ASCT on the rate of infections and neutropenic
        fever. As of June 2009, 126 MM patients who underwent ASCT in our institution
        were randomized to receive or not prophylactic antibiotics post-ASCT. The
        prophylactic antibiotic regimen included IV vancomycin at a dose of 1000 mg
        once daily and ciprofloxacin at a dose of 500 mg, PO, twice daily. The administration
        of prophylactic antibiotics was started on day 0 of ASCT and continued until
        resolution of neutropenia or until the occurrence of a febrile event. In addition,
        all patients, irrespective of randomization, received fluconazole 200 mg,
        PO, once daily, and valacyclovir 500 mg, PO, once daily. G-CSF was given to
        all patients until resolution of neutropenia. When temperature exceeded 38\u00b0C
        for more than 1 hour, peripheral blood and urine samples were collected for
        microbiologic cultures, a chest X-ray was performed and empirical antibiotic
        treatment with IV wide spectrum antibiotics including amikacin, ceftazidime
        and therapeutic dose of vancomycin was started. This empirical therapy was
        later modified individually, according to cultures and sensitivity data. If
        patient remained febrile for 3-5 days after this initial treatment, a second-line
        regimen consisting of a carbapenem with a glycopeptide in the majority of
        cases was administered, until fever resolution. In the case of a proven or
        suspected fungal or viral infection, appropriate antifungal or antiviral therapy
        was administered. Sixty-nine (54%) patients were randomized to receive antibiotic
        prophylaxis. These patients had a significantly lower incidence of neutropenic
        fever post-ASCT compared to those who received only supportive care (58% versus
        92%; p 0.5\u00d7109/L: 9.6 versus 10.7, p 25\u00d7109/L: 9.7 versus 11.8,

        EBBLA, all the aforementioned molecules were measured in peripheral venous
        blood samples prior (baseline), during (at 10 and 30 minutes), at the end
        of EBBLA (46+/-9 minutes) and one hour after its end.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSerum
        growth hormone glucose and cortisol were found elevated at the 10th and 30th
        minute and at the end of EBBLA. Serum prolactin increased only at the 30th

        Agents On Peripheral Blood Mobilization, Harvest, Response and Survival in
        Patients Undergoing ASCT for Multiple Myeloma. A Single-Center Experience
        in 210 Patients.", "abstract": "Abstract 2279 Poster Board II-256 High dose
        therapy (HDT) with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has become
        the standard of care for eligible patients with multiple myeloma (MM) younger
        than 65 years. Induction therapy with combination regimens such as VAD or
        single agent dexamethasone has little impact on SC mobilization and offers
        a PFS of 12-18 months post-ASCT. Recently, novel agents (IMiDs and bortezomib)
        are used in the induction regimens prior to ASCT. The aim of this study was
        to assess the impact of conventional and novel agent-based induction regimens
        on SC harvest, response and survival among patients with MM treated in the
        Department of Clinical Therapeutics of the University of Athens, Greece. From
        January 1996 to June 2009, 210 consecutive patients who underwent ASCT were
        classified according to the induction regimens to: those who had received
        conventional chemotherapy (CC) only (MP, CD or VAD) (group A); those who were
        treated with CC followed by novel agent-based regimens (dexamethasone plus
        an IMiD and/or bortezomib; group B); and patients who were treated with novel
        agent-based regimens only prior to SC collection (group C). Stem cells were
        mobilized with G-CSF alone or with cyclophosphamide and G-CSF. Group A included
        102 (49%) patients, group B 72 (34%) and group C 33 (16%) patients. Induction
        with novel agents only (group C) yielded a significantly greater SC collection
        compared to induction with CC only (group A) or CC followed by novel agent-based
        therapies (group B) (p=0.006 and p=0.038, respectively). The mean number of
        collected CD34+ cells/kg was 10\u00d710 6 (range 2-43.2\u00d710 6 ), 10.4\u00d710
        6 (range 2-49\u00d710 6 ) and 15.1\u00d710 6 (range 2-65\u00d710 6 ) for groups
        A, B and C, respectively. The probability to collect a number of at least
        5\u00d710 6 CD34+ cells/kg was significantly higher in patients who received
        novel agents only when compared to those of groups A and B (78.8% vs. 57.5%,
        p=0.021). Among patients of group A, those who received induction with VAD
        had a significantly greater SC collection when compared to MP or CD (mean
        CD34+ cells/kg collected: 12.2\u00d710 6 vs. 7.56\u00d710 6 /kg; p=0.031).
        Moreover, SC yield did not differ between patients who received VAD only or
        novel agent-based regimens only, as induction therapy (p=0.155). Engraftment
        data were comparable between the three groups. Age >55 years (p=0.039) and
        prior radiation therapy (p vs. 61.7%, p=0.007; at least vgPR 27.2% vs. 18.9%,
        p=0.032, for groups C and A, respectively). However, post-ASCT, patients of
        groups A and C achieved similar response rates (OR: 94.6% vs. 92.9%, p=0.736
        and at least vgPR: 53.6% vs. 46.7%, p=0.526). The median OS, from the date
        of ASCT, in all patients was 74 months. Factors associated with longer OS
        included the achievement of CR or sCR post-ASCT (p=0.027), ISS-1 and -2 vs.
        ISS-3 (p=0.007), low beta2-microglobulin ( vs. focal and diffuse, p=0.027).
        The use of novel agent-based regimens in induction therapy was associated
        with a probability of 4-year OS of 88% compared to 54% in patients of group
        A. There was a trend in favor of novel agent-based regimens as induction therapy
        in terms of OS (median 89 vs. 62 months, for patients of groups B+C and A,
        respectively; p=0.144). Furthermore, patients of group C had superior EFS
        post-ASCT compared to patients of group A (median 84 vs. 27 months; p=0.046).
        Other variables like mobilization regimen before HDT (cyclo 4g/m 2 +G-CSF
        vs. cyclo 2.5 g/m 2 +G-CSF vs. G-CSF only), high dose therapy dosage (melphalan
        200 mg/m 2 vs. 180 mg/m 2 vs. 140mg/m 2 or less), and the interval from diagnosis
        to ASCT (more or less than one year) did not correlate with OS or PFS. In
        conclusion, our study demonstrates that patients who received induction therapy
        with novel agents only prior to ASCT had a higher number of CD34+ cells collected
        when compared to induction with CC followed by novel agent-based regimens
        or CC alone. Furthermore, these patients achieved a higher response rate and
        a better quality of response before HDT, compared to patients who received
        CC only, but this did not correspond to a higher response rate post-ASCT.
        Further follow-up is needed to fully assess the impact of novel agent induction
        on patient9s OS. Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

        Case report: A 50-year-old woman with a history of mastectomy for a T4N1M0
        right breast carcinoma was referred to us with diplopia due to bilateral extraocular
        muscle metastases, 5 years post mastectomy. Multiple metastases to the whole
        body were also present. A combination of high-dose irradiation, hormonotherapy
        and chemotherapy were performed. Results: Despite the multidisciplinary treatment
        approach, the diplopia persisted. A literature review revealed only 4 cases
        of bilateral metastases to extraocular muscles. The present case is the second
        attributed to lobular carcinoma and the only one treated with a high dose

        Determinant of Responsiveness to Platinum-Based Chemotherapy for non Small-Cell
        Lung Cancer", "abstract": "Although platinum-based chemotherapy remains the
        \u201cstandard\u201d in advanced non small-cell lung cancer, not all patients
        derive clinical benefit from such a treatment. Hence, the development of predictive
        biomarkers able to identify lung cancer patients who are most likely to benefit
        from cisplatin-based chemotherapy has become a scientific priority. Among
        the molecular pathways involved in DNA damage control after chemotherapy,
        the nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a critical process for the repair
        of DNA damage caused by cisplatin-induced DNA adducts. Many reports have explored
        the role of the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 enzyme (ERCC1)
        expression in the repair mechanism of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts in cancer
        cells. Using immunohistochemistry in resected tumors from patients included
        in the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial, the study of important biomarkers
        showed that high ERCC1 protein expression was associated with improved survival
        in chemo-na\u00efve patients. On the contrary, the benefit of adjuvant cisplatin-based
        chemotherapy was more profound in patients with low ERCC1 expression. In a
        prospective cohort studying mRNA expression in tumor biopsies from patients
        receiving customized therapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine depending on the
        molecular profile of the tumour, results showed that patients with low ERCC1
        mRNA expression had a longer median survival compared to those with high expression.
        These data suggest the potent use of ERCC1 as a molecular predictor of clinical
        resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting of NSCLC.
        Nevertheless, optimization of methodology, including standardization of technical
        procedures, as well as validation of ERCC1 protein expression in large prospective
        cohorts, seem necessary before any routine immunohistochemical validation
        of ERCC1 can be implemented in daily practice.", "venue": "Biomarker Insights",

        Primary fallopian tube carcinoma (PFTC) is a rare gynecologic malignancy with
        very few data existing on the activity of the combination of paclitaxel with
        a platinum analogue as adjuvant chemotherapy. Methods: We retrospectively
        analyzed 41 consecutive patients with PFTC who were treated postoperatively
        with paclitaxel- and platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Results: We
        observed 12 (63.2%) complete and 6 (31.6%) partial responses among 19 patients
        with measurable disease. The median time to disease progression (TTP) for
        all patients was 68 months. The median overall survival (OS) for all patients
        has not been reached yet. The median TTP was 84 months for patients with stage
        I/II disease and 34 months for patients with advanced disease (p = 0.017).
        Median OS has not been reached yet for patients with stage I/II PFTC, while
        it was 63.8 months for patients with stage III/IV disease (p = 0.002). Furthermore,
        OS has not been reached yet for patients with optimally debulked tumors, while
        it was 34.1 months for patients with residual disease >2 cm (p < 0.0001).
        Conclusion: Adjuvant platinum- and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy should be
        regarded as the standard treatment in patients with PFTC. Early stage disease
        and optimal debulking are associated with improved TTP and OS.", "venue":

        Giant cell arteritis (GCA) of the breast is one of the less recognized variants
        of this vasculitis and may represent an isolated finding or a manifestation
        of a more widespread disease. Case Report: We present the case of a 74-year-old
        woman with malaise and a 14-day persistent fever, reaching 38\u00b0C. There
        was a bilateral, painless and mobile axillary lymphadenopathy and a slight
        tenderness over the medial and lateral upper quadrants of her left breast,
        as well as an independent palpable tender mass in the upper outer quadrant
        of the same breast measuring 2 cm in its greatest diameter. Constitutional
        symptoms, anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggestive
        of polymyalgia rheumatica were also present. An invasive ductal carcinoma
        of the breast with coincidental pathologic findings of GCA in the same biopsy
        specimen was revealed. In this case, arteritis was limited to the breast and
        presented with diffuse breast tenderness. No other artery was involved by
        GCA. All arteritis-related symptoms disappeared after the removal of the tumor.
        Conclusions: There is a relationship between cancer, particularly breast cancer,
        and GCA of the same organ, but the real nature of this association still remains
        unknown.", "venue": "Oncology Research and Treatment", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

        with improvement in endothelial function", "abstract": "Primary objective:
        Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) is used for the mobilization
        of bone marrow and endothelial progenitor cells, though G-CSF-induced inflammation
        may cause endothelial dysfunction. We examined the effects of G-CSF on endothelium,
        C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and anti-inflammatory
        cytokines namely interleukin 10 (IL-10). Research design: We studied 60 women
        with breast cancer, who were randomized to either subcutaneous G-CSF (5 \u03bcg/kg),
        o.d. for 5 days after adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 40) or placebo (n = 20).
        Experimental interventions: We measured flow-mediated dilatation (FMD%) of
        the brachial artery by ultrasonography, CRP, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and the ratio
        TNF-\u03b1/ IL-10 blood levels before, 2-h and 5-days after the G-CSF or placebo
        treatment. Main outcomes and results: There was a greater increase of FMD,
        IL-10 and reduction of TNF-\u03b1/ IL-10, 2 h and 5 days after the G-CSF treatment
        compared to placebo. Although, CRP and TNF-\u03b1 were higher, TNF-\u03b1/IL-10
        was lower at the end of G-CSF treatment compared to placebo. Improvement of
        FMD was related to changes of IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1/IL-10. Conclusions: Treatment
        with G-CSF improves endothelial function in vivo, possibly by shifting the
        balance between the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.", "venue": "Growth

        tolerance and outcome.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe prognostic significance
        of age in ovarian cancer has not been clarified. We investigated the characteristics
        of ovarian cancer presenting in ages > 70 years and assessed the prognostic
        significance of advanced age.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nFour hundred and
        fifty-three patients with stage IIC-IV ovarian cancer (age>70 years n=106
        [23%]), treated postoperatively with platinum-based chemotherapy were retrospectively
        reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMedian overall survival (OS) of patients 570 years
        old (52.3 months, 95% CI: 43.2-61.3) was longer than that of older patients
        (38.8 months, 95% CI: 29.9-47.7) (p =0.005), but this difference was not significant
        in a multivariate analysis (p=0.978). Age >70 years was correlated with worse
        performance status (PS) (p=0.019), higher tumor grade (p=0.033), residual
        disease >2 cm (p=0.006) and less frequent paclitaxel administration (p<0.001).
        Toxicity from chemotherapy was similar between the two age groups, but the
        relative dose intensity of paclitaxel was lower among elderly patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe
        worse outcome of ovarian cancer in elderly patients may be attributed to other
        associated adverse prognostic factors, but advanced age was not an independent

        "PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION\nUterine sarcomas are rare neoplasms characterized
        by a high rate of local recurrences and distant metastases. The role of chemotherapy
        in early-stage completely resected disease remains controversial.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThirty-one
        patients with Stage I or II uterine sarcomas, referred to our center for adjuvant
        chemotherapy, received anthracycline-based regimens. Seventeen (54.8%) patients
        received ifosfamide, etoposide and epirubicin, six (19.4%) were treated with
        doxorubicin and carboplatin, three (9.6%) were administered doxorubicin and
        ifosfamide, while five (16.1%) patients received various anthracycline-based
        regimens.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWith a median follow-up of 82 months disease recurred
        in 12 (38.7%) patients. Five-year survival probability is estimated at 54%.
        Both median overall survival and time to progression for all patients have
        not been reached yet. Patients who received ifosfamide-containing regimens
        had a statistically significant benefit in overall survival (p < or = 0.05)
        when compared with those treated with non-ifosfamide-containing regimens.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur
        data suggest a potential role for anthracycline- and ifosfamide-containing
        chemotherapy in the adjuvant setting for early-stage uterine sarcomas.", "venue":

        A Single Institution Experience", "abstract": "Background: Young age has been
        reported to be a favorable prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. The aim of
        the present study was to investigate the characteristics of ovarian cancer
        presenting in patients aged \u226440 and assess the prognostic significance
        of young age. Methods: Data from 591 consecutive ovarian cancer patients,
        including 37 subjects (6.3%) aged \u226440, who were treated postoperatively
        with platinum-based chemotherapy in our institution were retrospectively reviewed.
        Results: In our series, age \u226440 did not show an independent association
        with overall (p = 0.542) or progression-free survival (p = 0.334). Nonetheless,
        it was correlated with low tumor grade (p = 0.009) and small volume of residual
        disease after primary surgery (p = 0.020), while there was a nonsignificant
        trend for correlation with performance status 0 (p = 0.052). Stratified analysis
        showed that age \u226440 was associated with improved overall survival in
        the subgroups of serous histology and stage IIC\u2013IV disease; however,
        multivariate analyses failed to identify age as an independent predictor of
        survival within either subgroup (p = 0.079 and p = 0.585, respectively). Conclusions:
        Age \u226440 was not an independent prognostic factor in our analysis. The
        survival advantage of young patients may be attributed to the association
        with low tumor grade, more complete surgical debulking and better performance
        status.", "venue": "Oncology", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 49, "citationCount":

        In the present study we report that rhIL-4 has an antiproliferative effect
        on five of nine cell lines derived from human colon tumors, head and neck
        tumors, and glioblastomas as measured by a decrease of colony formation in
        human tumor cloning assays. All of the cell lines with in vitro responsiveness
        express at least 100 high-affinity receptors for human interleukin 4 per cell
        on their cell surface, whereas the nonresponsive tumor cell lines lack expression
        of high-affinity receptors for human interleukin 4 on their cell surface.
        In the next series of experiments we have xenotransplanted some of the responsive
        cell lines into athymic nude mice. Subsequently, the animals were treated
        s.c. twice daily with 0.5 mg/m2 rlil I -4 or control vehicle for at least
        12 days. There was a clear growth inhibition of these xenotransplanted tumors
        in the mice treated with rhIL-4. Histology of the tumors in both groups revealed
        no marked infiltration with murine hematopoietic and lymphocytic cells as
        evaluated by staining with a rat anti-mouse CD45 antibody. We conclude that
        rhIL-4 has a direct therapeutic activity on the growth of some human epithelial
        and nonepithelial tumor cell lines which, along with its regula tory function
        on hematolymphopoietic cells, makes this cytokine an inter esting candidate
        for experimental tumor therapy.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount":

        papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) and uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCCC)
        represent more aggressive tumors than the more common endometroid cancers,
        exhibiting a propensity for distant metastasis. The aim of this study was
        to investigate the activity and safety of paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy
        as the only adjuvant treatment in patients with surgically resected UPSC and
        UCCC.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFifteen patients with Stage IB-IV UPSC or UCCC were treated
        with a mean of six courses of paclitaxel 175 mg/m3 plus carboplatin AUC 5
        at three-week intervals, three to six weeks after undergoing surgery with
        curative intent. No patient had residual disease after surgery and none underwent
        pre- or post-chemotherapy irradiation.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWith a median follow-up
        of 29.4 months, six patients (40%) relapsed and two (13%) died of disease.
        Mean time to recurrence was 16.9 months. Recurrence rate per Stage was 17%
        for Stage IB/C, 57% for Stage IIIA/C and 50% for Stage IV. Projected 5-year
        overall survival and progression-free survival was 79.7% and 55.7%, respectively.
        All relapses were abdominopelvic whereas in one case pelvic recurrence was
        accompanied by lung metastasis. The most frequent grade 3-4 toxicity was neutropenia.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nChemotherapy
        with paclitaxel plus carboplatin is feasible and possibly prevents distant

        followed by CMF with or without paclitaxel, in patients with high-risk operable
        breast cancer: a randomized phase III study conducted by the Hellenic Cooperative
        Oncology Group.", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nThe aim of this study was to explore
        the effect of dose-dense sequential chemotherapy with or without paclitaxel
        primarily on disease-free survival (DFS) and secondarily on overall survival
        (OS) in patients with high-risk operable breast cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND
        METHODS\nFrom June 1997 until November 2000, 604 patients with T1-3N1M0 or
        T3N0M0 tumors were randomized to three cycles of epirubicin 110 mg/m2 followed
        by three cycles of paclitaxel 250 mg/m2 followed by three cycles of ''intensified''
        CMF (cyclophosphamide 840 mg/m2, methotrexate 47 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 840
        mg/m2) (group A), or to four cycles of epirubicin followed by four cycles
        of CMF, as in group A (group B). All cycles were given every 2 weeks with
        granulocyte colony-stimulating factor support.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 595
        patients were eligible. Median follow-up was 61.7 months for group A and 62
        months for group B. The 3-year DFS was 80% in group A and 77% in group B.
        Survival rates were 93% and 90%, respectively. The effect of treatment on
        the hazard of death was different according to hormonal receptor status. More
        specifically, in patients with negative receptor status the hazard of death
        was significantly higher for group B (hazard ratio 2.42). Both regimens were
        well tolerated and severe acute side-effects were infrequent. No cases of
        severe cardiotoxicity or acute leukemia were recorded.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe
        present study failed to demonstrate a significant difference in DFS or OS
        between the two treatment groups. However, our study has shown clearly that
        high-dose paclitaxel can be safely incorporated to dose-dense sequential chemotherapy.",

        DNA damage formation and repair in vivo and to search for possible correlations
        with clinical outcome in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).\n\n\nPATIENTS
        AND METHODS\nThe formation and subsequent repair of DNA damage (monoadducts
        and interstrand cross-links) in the p53 tumor-suppressor gene, the proto-oncogene
        N-ras, and the housekeeping gene beta-actin during the first 24 hours after
        treatment with high-dose melphalan (HDM; 200 mg/m2) supported by autologous
        blood stem-cell transplantation (ABSCT) was measured in blood leukocytes of
        26 patients with MM. The peak DNA adduct levels, the total amount of adducts
        over time, and the rate of adducts repair in each gene were correlated with
        response and time to progression after HDM.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe levels of gene-specific
        DNA damage formation and the individual repairing capacity varied up to 16-fold
        among patients, indicating that the melphalan-induced biologic effect in vivo
        is highly individualized. A significantly greater DNA damage and a slower
        rate of repair in p53 for all end points under study were found in patients
        who achieved tumor reduction compared with nonresponding patients. Furthermore,
        longer progression-free survival correlated with increased peak monoadduct
        levels in the p53 gene (P = .032).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncreased DNA damage and
        slower repairing capacity in the p53 gene from blood leukocytes after HDM
        correlate with improved outcome of patients with MM who undergo ABSCT. These
        results suggest that quantitation of such biologic end points may identify

        was 31.8% (3 CR, 25 PR), P - 0.733. Median time to progression favored the

        bisphosphonates were 35 infusions and 39.3 months for patients with ONJ compared
        with 15 infusions (P < .001) and 19 months (P = .001), respectively, for patients
        with no ONJ. The incidence of ONJ increased with time to exposure from 1.5%
        among patients treated for 4 to 12 months to 7.7% for treatment of 37 to 48
        months. The cumulative hazard was significantly higher with zoledronic acid
        compared with pamidronate alone or pamidronate and zoledronic acid sequentially
        (P < .001). All but two patients with ONJ had a history of dental procedures
        within the last year or use of dentures.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of bisphosphonates
        seems to be associated with the development of ONJ. Length of exposure seems
        to be the most important risk factor for this complication. The type of bisphosphonate
        may play a role and previous dental procedures may be a precipitating factor.",

        and carboplatin: clinical, radiological and functional assessment.", "abstract":
        "BACKGROUND\nSmall series and retrospective studies have suggested that treatment
        with gemcitabine may be associated with pulmonary toxicity. However, a prospective
        evaluation of cancer patients treated with gemcitabine-based chemotherapy
        without neoplastic involvement of the thorax and without administration of
        radiotherapy has not been performed.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nTo investigate
        this issue, 41 consecutive patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin
        underwent prospective evaluation of lung function, which included pulmonary
        symptoms, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases and radiographic
        studies. Assessment was performed before and after completion of chemotherapy
        in all patients. Patients with a substantial decline in diffusion capacity
        for carbon monoxide (DLCO), defined as a drop of > or = 20%, were reassessed
        2 months later.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter chemotherapy, there were no significant
        changes in forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1),
        FEV1/FVC ratio, alveolar volume or total lung capacity. In contrast, there
        was a significant decline in DLCO (73 +/- 22 versus 67 +/- 24% predicted;
        P = 0.017) and in carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO) (89 +/- 24 versus
        80 +/- 24% predicted; P = 0.004). Arterial blood gases did not change following
        treatment. Ten of the 41 patients (24%) exhibited a substantial decline in
        DLCO, which, however, recovered within 2 months (DLCO at baseline, immediately
        after therapy and at 2 months after completion of treatment, 84 +/- 14, 58
        +/- 16 and 77 +/- 17% predicted, respectively; P < 0.001; baseline DLCO versus
        DLCO at 2 months, P > 0.05). Four of the 41 patients (10%) experienced dyspnea,
        which was self-limiting, with the exception of one patient who developed interstitial
        lung fibrosis. Among the various risk factors examined, older age, female
        gender and lower baseline DLCO were associated with more profound changes
        in DLCO post-treatment.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis prospective analysis showed
        that the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin induces a significant,
        but reversible, decrease in diffusion capacity, which is mostly asymptomatic.
        Thus, this regimen is safe as regards clinically significant lung toxicity.",

        Cancer", "abstract": "Objective: We conducted a phase II trial to evaluate
        the activity of oral letrozole in women with relapsed or recurrent epithelial
        ovarian cancer. Methods: Twenty-seven patients were treated with letrozole
        at a dose of 2.5 mg once a day. Patients with measurable or evaluable disease
        (n = 21) and those with only increasing CA 125 serum levels (n = 6) were eligible.
        Paraffin-fixed histological sections from tumor specimens resected at the
        initial laparotomy were assessed for the presence of estrogen, and progesterone
        receptors. Results: Among the 21 patients with measurable or evaluable disease
        who were evaluated for response by WHO criteria, we observed one complete
        and two partial responses for an objective response rate of 15%. Using criteria
        for CA 125 response we obtained a marker response in 4 of 27 patients (15%),
        and the marker remained stable in 5 additional patients (18%). Letrozole treatment
        was generally well tolerated. No correlation was observed between tumor marker
        response or stabilization and either estrogen or progesterone receptor expression.
        Conclusion: The results of our study suggest that the aromatase inhibitor
        letrozole is an agent with some activity and limited toxicity for relapsed
        ovarian cancer. As we could not find any association between response and
        hormonal receptor expression, the underlying mechanisms of letrozole action

        "title": "Outcome of elderly patients following platinum-based chemotherapy
        for advanced urothelial cancer.", "abstract": "4542 Background: Elderly patients
        represent a significant proportion of patients with advanced urothelial tract
        cancer in Europe and USA. Nevertheless, there is limited information regarding
        the tolerability of and benefit from systemic chemotherapy in this population.
        We, therefore, analysed the tolerability and efficacy of platinum-based chemotherapy
        in patients of 70 years of age or older who had been entered into our database.\n\n\nMETHODS\n381
        consecutive patients with advanced urothelial cancer were included in this
        analysis. All patients had been treated with cisplatin or carboplatin-based
        chemotherapy within the context of 4 studies. 116 patients were > 70 years
        and were analysed separately.\n\n\nRESULTS\nElderly patients had lower baseline
        median creatinine clearance (52.4 vs. 68.7 ml/min, p<0.001), lower baseline
        hemoglobin (11.96 vs. 12.46 g/dl, p=0.017) and received carboplatin-based
        chemotherapy more frequently (32.8% vs. 11.7%, p<0.001) than younger patients.
        Median number of chemotherapy cycles, relative dose intensity and overall
        response rates were similar between the two groups. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity
        was also similar except from anemia, which was more frequent among elderly
        patients (13.7% vs. 4.7%, p=0.037). Median follow up of living was 34.8 months.
        Median survival for elderly patients was 9.3 months and for younger patients
        10.8 months (p=0.16).Univariate analysis of baseline characteristics of elderly
        patients showed that ECOG PS 2 or 3, hemoglobin 10000, weight loss and liver
        metastases were associated with worse prognosis. Multivariate analysis showed
        that PS and baseline Hb were independently associated with prognosis (p=0.001
        and p=0.017, respectively). Patients with PS 0 or 1 and hemoglobin >= 10 g/dl
        (n=71) had a median survival of 13.9 months, while patients with one or two
        adverse prognostic features (n=42) had a median survival of 5 months (p<0.0001).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nElderly
        patients tolerate platinum-based chemotherapy as well as younger patients
        and benefit to the same extent. The combination of PS and baseline hemoglobin
        can be useful in accurately defining two groups of patients with distinctly
        different outcome. No significant financial relationships to disclose.", "venue":

        evaluate the prognostic significance of the immunohistochemical expression
        of p53, bcl-2, c-erbB-2 and cathepsin-D in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC).\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe
        analyzed 100 patients with ovarian carcinoma, FIGO Stage IC-IV who underwent
        primary cytoreductive surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide
        and a platinum analogue (CP) (n = 46) or paclitaxel and a platinum analogue
        (TP) (n = 54). Immunohistochemical expression was studied on paraffin-embedded
        tissue from the primary tumor.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter a median follow-up of 55
        months median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were
        16 and 41 months, respectively. Positive bcl-2 staining and absence of cathepsin-D
        expression were associated with an increased complete response rate in the
        CP group (p = 0.011 and p = 0.003) but not in the TP group. PFS and OS were
        not associated with the expression of any of the markers studied. FIGO stage
        (p = 0.006) and histology (p = 0.047) were the only independent prognostic
        factors for survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBcl-2 and cathepsin D expression are
        associated with response to CP but not TP chemotherapy. P53, bcl-2, c-erb
        B-2 and cathepsin D expression was not correlated with PFS and OS in our study.",

        were randomized to receive either paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2) in a 3-h infusion
        followed by epirubicin (EPI) 80 mg/m(2) (group A) or paclitaxel, as in group
        A, followed by Cp at an AUC of 6 mg x min/ml (group B) every 3 weeks for six

        mg/m 2 IV day 1-3,) to 11 patients with WM. Most patients had features indicating

        or recurrent cervical cancer to evaluate its activity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSixty
        patients were treated on an outpatient basis with Ifosfamide (I) 1500 mg/m(2)
        intravenously over 1 h on Days 1-3, paclitaxel (T) 175 mg/m(2) as a 3-h intravenous
        infusion on Day 1, and cisplatin (P) 75 mg/m(2) intravenously over 2 h on
        Day 2 with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) support. The chemotherapy
        was repeated every 4 weeks for a maximum of six courses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-seven
        patients received at least two courses of treatment and are evaluable for
        response. Twenty-six patients (46%) achieved an objective response, including
        19% complete and 27% partial responses. The median duration of response was

        doxorubicin (Caelyx) and paclitaxel in locally advanced breast cancer: a phase
        II study by the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nTo
        determine the activity and safety of the combination of paclitaxel and pegylated
        liposomal doxorubicin (Caelyx) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer.\n\n\nPATIENTS
        AND METHODS\nThis was a multicenter phase II study. Thirty-five newly diagnosed
        patients with locally advanced breast cancer were included in the study. Histological
        or cytological diagnosis was necessary for inclusion. Median age was 54 years
        (range 26-73 years). Fifteen patients were premenopausal and 20 postmenopausal.
        Paclitaxel was administered at a dose of 175 mg/m(2) and pegylated liposomal
        doxorubicin 35 mg/m(2) every 3 weeks for six cycles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nTwenty-five
        patients (71%) responded. Six (17%) had a complete response, 19 (54%) had
        a partial response, four remained stable, two progressed and four were not
        evaluated for response due to discontinuation of chemotherapy. Three patients
        had a pathologically complete response. A total of 173 cycles were administered.
        The primary toxicity observed was skin toxicity. Grade 3 skin toxicity was
        noted in four patients (11%). Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) grade
        3 was experienced by three (9%). Two patients presented with PPE and skin
        toxicity. Hematological toxicities included grade 3 leukopenia in four patients
        (3%). Other grade 3 toxicities were uncommon and included only alopecia in
        29 patients (83%). Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity was not observed in any patient.
        Dose reduction was necessary in seven patients; in six due to skin toxicity
        and in one due to neutropenia. Four patients discontinued treatment due to
        skin toxicity. There were no treatment-related deaths.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe
        combination of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and paclitaxel was active in
        locally advanced breast cancer. The primary toxicity was cutaneous toxicity
        and it was manageable.", "venue": "Annals of Oncology", "year": 2002, "referenceCount":

        chemotherapy with autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) support
        has become a widely used treatment strategy. In order to simplify the procedure,
        a single very large\u2010volume leukapheresis programme combined with short\u2010term
        refrigerated storage of the PBPC was developed. Seventy\u2010two patients
        suffering from various relatively chemosensitive malignancies received high\u2010dose
        chemotherapy, consisting of agents with short in vivo half\u2010lives and
        24 to 48 hours later, the refrigerated PBPC were reinfused. A single very
        large\u2010volume apheresis was sufficient to obtain at least 2 \u00d7 106/kg
        CD34+ cells in 58 patients (81%), and 63% had at least 2.5 \u00d7 106 CD34+
        cells/kg. Only two patients (3%) were transplanted with less than 1 \u00d7
        106 CD34+ cells/kg. In three patients (4%) leukapheresis was repeated because
        of insufficient number of PBPC. The median CD34+ cell count was 3 \u00d7 106/kg.
        A median of 38.5 L blood (range, 21 to 59) was processed, which accounted
        for a median of 9 \u00d7 patient''s total blood volume. Very large\u2010volume
        leukapharesis was well tolerated with symptomatic hypocalcemia being the most
        common (18%) side\u2010effect. The median time to neutrophils >1.5 \u00d7
        109/L, and to self\u2010supporting platelet count >25 \u00d7 109/L, was 10
        and 12 days after reinfusion of PBPC graft, respectively. There were no treatment\u2010related
        deaths. Our results indicate that this simplified approach of PBPC transplantation
        can be associated with prompt hematologic recovery in most patients and that
        it can be useful in settings where facilities are limited or for certain diseases
        where conditioning regimens with short half\u2010life are appropriate. J.

        "OBJECTIVES\nBoth paclitaxel and cisplatin have moderate activity in patients
        with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium, and the combination
        of these two agents has shown activity in a variety of solid tumors. We administered
        this combination to patients with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the
        endometrium to evaluate its activity and to define its toxicity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-four
        consecutive patients were treated on an outpatient basis with paclitaxel 175
        mg/m(2) administered intravenously over a 3-h period followed by cisplatin
        75 mg/m(2) administered intravenously with granulocyte colony-stimulating
        factor (G-CSF) support. The chemotherapy was repeated every 3 weeks for a
        maximum of six courses.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen patients (67%; 95% confidence
        interval, 45-84%) achieved an objective response, including seven complete
        responses and nine partial responses. The median duration of response was
        7 months, and the median times to progression and survival for all patients
        were 8.4 and 17.6 months, respectively. Some degree of neurotoxicity occurred
        in 44% of patients. Grade 3 or 4 toxicity included granulocytopenia in 22%
        of patients and peripheral neuropathy in 9%.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe combination
        of paclitaxel with cisplatin with G-CSF support appears active in patients
        with metastatic or recurrent carcinoma of the endometrium. The significant
        incidence of neurotoxicity is of concern and alternative methods of administration
        of the two agents could be evaluated.", "venue": "Gynecologic Oncology", "year":

        (NSCLC). Patients and Methods: Fifty-one chemotherapy-naive patients with
        NSCLC were treated with gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1 and
        8 and docetaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously on day 8 with granulocyte colony-stimulating
        factor (150 mg/m2, subcutaneously) support from day 9 to day 15. Treatment
        was repeated every 3 weeks. Results: The patients\u2019 median age was 64
        years. The World Health Organization performance status was 0 to 1 in 39 patients
        and 2 in 12 patients. Fifteen patients (29%) had stage IIIB disease, and 36
        (71%) had stage IV; histology was mainly squamous cell carcinoma (59%). A
        partial response was achieved in 19 patients (37.5%; 95% confidence interval,
        24% to 50%); stable disease and progressive disease were each observed in
        16 patients (31.4%). The median duration of response and the time to tumor
        progression were 5 and 6 months, respectively. The median survival was 13
        months, and the actuarial 1-year survival was 50.7%. Grade 4 anemia and thrombocytopenia
        were rare (2%). Four patients (8%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, and
        all were complicated with fever; there was no treatmentrelated death. Grade
        3 or 4 diarrhea occurred in three patients (6%), grade 2 or 3 neurotoxicity
        in four patients (8%), grade 2 or 3 asthenia in 10 patients (20%), and grade
        2 or 3 edema in 10 patients (20%). Conclusion: The combination of docetaxel/gemcitabine
        is well tolerated, can be used for outpatients, and is active for the treatment
        of advanced NSCLC. This treatment merits further comparison with other cisplatin-
        or carboplatin-based combinations. J Clin Oncol 17:914-920. r 1999 by American

        chemotherapy-naive patients (median age, 65 years) with histologically confirmed
        pancreatic cancer were treated, after appropriate premedication, with docetaxel
        (100 mg/m(2)) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (150 microg/m(2)/d
        subcutaneously days 2 through 10) every 3 weeks. World Health Organization
        performance status was 0 to 1 in 28 patients (85%) and 2 in 5 patients (15%).
        Twenty-nine patients had stage III and IV disease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne complete
        response (3%) and one partial response (3%) were observed for an overall response
        rate of 6% (95% confidence interval, 2.1% to 14.2%). Nineteen patients (58%)
        had stable disease and 12 (36%) had progressive disease. The duration of the
        two objective responses was 10 and 28 weeks, and the median time to tumor
        progression was 20 weeks. The median overall survival was 36 weeks. The actuarial
        1-year survival was 36.4%. The performance status improved in seven of 21
        assessable patients (24%) and pain improved in 14 of 21 (67%) assessable patients;
        five patients (29%) experienced weight gain during treatment. Disease-related
        asthenia, anorexia, vomiting, and diarrhea improved in 29%, 15%, 67%, and
        47% of the assessable patients, respectively. Serum concentrations of CA 19-9

        occurred in four patients (12%) and eight patients (24%), respectively, with
        two episodes of febrile neutropenia. There were no treatment-related deaths.
        Grade 3/4 asthenia occurred in three patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nAlthough docetaxel

        several cancer patients who developed neutropenic fever were effectively treated
        on an outpatient basis with either intravenous or oral antibiotics. This approach
        is associated with reduced cost and improved patient convenience. However,
        the appropriate antibiotic regimen and the role of growth factors have not
        been established yet. In order to address these issues we performed a nonrandomized
        phase II study to assess the feasibility and efficacy of an oral antibiotic
        regimen in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
        for the outpatient treatment of cancer patients with low-risk neutropenic
        fever. In 50 patients with solid tumors or lymphoma, 60 episodes of neutropenic
        fever were treated with the combination of oral ofloxacin 400 mg twice a day,
        oral amoxicillin 1 g 3 times a day and G-CSF 5 \u03bcg/kg/day subcutaneously.
        Patients receiving G-CSF prophylaxis were eligible for our study. Oral antibiotics
        were administered for at least 5 days and G-CSF was continued until resolution
        of neutropenia. Our patients were ambulatory, hemodynamically stable, and
        without significant comorbidity. Our combination was successful in 57 episodes
        (95%) with a median time for fever resolution of 3 days (range: 1\u20135 days).
        There was no significant toxicity associated with the antibiotic regimen with
        the exception of one case of reversible renal impairment. The role of G-CSF
        in the success of our antibiotic treatment is highly questionable since one
        half of our patients developed fever while on G-CSF prophylaxis. The combination
        of oral ofloxacin and amoxicillin with G-CSF is highly effective for the outpatient
        treatment of cancer patients who develop uncomplicated febrile neutropenia.
        The relative contribution of G-CSF needs clarification with a prospective
        randomized study.", "venue": "Oncology", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 15,

        of paclitaxel with doxorubicin has yielded high response rates in metastatic
        breast cancer, severe cardiotoxic events have been reported in several patients.
        The rationale for our study was to evaluate the activity of paclitaxel/doxorubicin
        combination in patients with this disease but to avoid excessive cardiotoxicity.
        Therefore, we administered 4 cycles of doxorubicin/paclitaxel followed by
        6 cycles of standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF)
        regimen. Study medication consisted of doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 as a 15-min intravenous
        infusion followed by paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion. CMF regimen
        consisted of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 as 1-hour intravenous infusion followed
        by methotrexate 40 mg/m2 and 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 bolus injection. The
        main toxicity of doxorubicin/paclitaxel treatment phase was neutropenia (WHO
        grade 3/4, 58%), but we observed only one cardiac adverse event. Toxicities
        of the CMF treatment phase were not significant. Of 24 patients evaluable
        for response, 2 (8%) had complete responses and 11 (46%) achieved partial
        response. Ten additional patients (42%) had stable disease. The median time
        to progression was 12 months and the median overall survival was 18.5 months.
        The sequential administration of doxorubicin and paclitaxel followed by CMF
        appeared active and well tolerated in patients with metastatic breast cancer.",

        docetaxel (Taxotere; Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer, Antony, France) and gemcitabine
        in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
        To date, 24 patients (five with stage IIIB and 19 with stage IV NSCLC) have
        been treated according to the protocol: gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 was administered
        on days 1 and 8 as a 30-minute infusion and docetaxel 100 mg/m2 was administered
        on day 8 as a 1-hour infusion after appropriate premedication. Granulocyte
        colony-stimulating factor 150 microg/m2 subcutaneously was given on days 9
        to 15. Treatment was repeated every 3 weeks. Grade 3/4 granulocytopenia occurred
        in seven (29%) patients, and one (4%) of these patients developed febrile
        neutropenia. Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia and anemia were observed in three
        (13%) and one (4%) patient, respectively. Grade 2 neurotoxicity and fatigue
        occurred in one (4%) patient each. Other toxicities were mild. There were
        no treatment-related deaths. Eight patients experienced a partial response
        (53.3%; 95% confidence interval, 28.1% to 78.6%), and stable and progressive
        disease were documented in two (13%) and five (33%) patients, respectively.
        The median delivered dose was 600 mg/m2/wk and 33 mg/m2/wk for gemcitabine
        and docetaxel, respectively. These preliminary data suggest that the docetaxel/gemcitabine
        combination has significant antitumor activity and is well tolerated in chemotherapy-naive
        patients with NSCLC. The study is ongoing.", "venue": "Seminars in Oncology",

        "One reason for relapse after high-dose tumor therapy with subsequent autologous
        stem cell transplantation is tumor cell contamination of the graft. Removal
        of tumor cells from bone marrow grafts by chemopurging with the ether lipid
        edelfosine has been established as an effective and simple method. When compared
        with bone marrow derived grafts, progenitor cells from peripheral blood have
        considerably reduced the haematological recovery times. However, this advantage
        is put at risk by the nonspecific haematotoxic activity of the purging agent.
        We therefore compared the in vitro recovery of peripheral blood derived progenitor
        cells (PBPC) from either non-purged (n = 41) or purged (75 micrograms/ml of
        ether lipid for 4 h at 37 degrees C, n = 48) leukapheresis products. The recovery
        of CFU-GM after cryopreservation was 63 +/- 4% without and 48 +/- 3% with
        purging (P = 0.007). After high-dose therapy, patients (n = 37) received similar
        amounts of either non-purged (n = 17) or purged (n = 20) autologous PBPC.
        The median haematological recovery times (non-purged vs purged) to > 500 WBC/microlitres
        were 9.0 vs 8.5 days after transplantation, to > 2000 PMN/microlitres 10.5
        vs 10.0 days, and to > 50,000 PLT/microlitres 15.5 vs 14.0 days. All differences
        were statistically not significant. We conclude that ether lipid purging of
        PBPC leads to a significant, however tolerable loss of progenitor cells in
        vitro, and that haematological recovery times after high-dose therapy are
        identically short, provided similar amounts of PBPC are reinfused.", "venue":

        plays an important role in activating the immune system against malignant
        cells. The human interleukin-4 receptor (hIL-4R) is not only expressed by
        hematopoietic cells but also on a large number of tissue specimens which include
        colon, breast and lung carcinomas. In this study we report that rhIL-4 has
        an antiproliferative effect on 2 out of 3 non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)
        cell lines in vitro as measured by human tumor cloning assays (HTCA). In comparison,
        rhIL-4 had no effect on the growth of small cell lung carcinoma cell lines
        (SCLC) in vitro. The response towards the cytokine is correlated with expression
        of at least 1500 high affinity receptors/cell for hIL-4 on the responsive
        cell lines. Xenotransplanting the human lung tumor cell lines into nude mice
        followed by 12 days of systemic treatment of the mice with rhIL-4 revealed
        a significant growth retardation of the IL-4R positive NSCLC cell lines when
        compared with the controls, whereas the growth of the IL-4R negative SCLC
        cell lines was unaffected also in vivo. Studies of possible mechanisms involved
        in the antiproliferative effect of rhIL-4 showed that rhIL-4 does not induce
        apoptosis or modulation of the transcription factor c myc in the responsive
        NSCLC cell lines. Additionally, the expression of the epidermal growth factor
        receptor (EGFR), which is discussed as mediating autocrine/paracrine growth
        stimulation of NSCLC, is unaffected by rhIL-4. However, we have observed that
        rhIL-4 inhibited G1-S-phase cell cycle progression. We conclude that rhIL-4
        has an antiproliferative effect on the growth of some NSCLC in vitro and in
        vivo. The mechanisms involved remain to be further elucidated.", "venue":

        In the present study we report that rhIL-4 has an antiproliferative effect
        on five of nine cell lines derived from human colon tumors, head and neck
        tumors, and glioblastomas as measured by a decrease of colony formation in
        human tumor cloning assays. All of the cell lines with in vitro responsiveness
        express at least 100 high-affinity receptors for human interleukin 4 per cell
        on their cell surface, whereas the nonresponsive tumor cell lines lack expression
        of high-affinity receptors for human interleukin 4 on their cell surface.
        In the next series of experiments we have xenotransplanted some of the responsive
        cell lines into athymic nude mice. Subsequently, the animals were treated
        s.c. twice daily with 0.5 mg/m2 rhIL-4 or control vehicle for at least 12
        days. There was a clear growth inhibition of these xenotransplanted tumors
        in the mice treated with rhIL-4. Histology of the tumors in both groups revealed
        no marked infiltration with murine hematopoietic and lymphocytic cells as
        evaluated by staining with a rat anti-mouse CD45 antibody. We conclude that
        rhIL-4 has a direct therapeutic activity on the growth of some human epithelial
        and nonepithelial tumor cell lines which, along with its regulatory function
        on hematolymphopoietic cells, makes this cytokine an interesting candidate
        for experimental tumor therapy.", "venue": "Cancer Research", "year": 1995,

        human tumor-cell lines by interleukin-1 in-vitro.", "abstract": "In this study
        we report that recombinant human (rh) interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha) has direct
        and dose-dependent growth-modulating effects on human tumor cell lines in
        vitro as measured by a human tumor cloning assay (HTCA). Colony formation
        of the melanoma cell line A 375 was inhibited by rhIL-1alpha, whereas colony
        formation of the glioblastoma cell line HTB 14 was enhanced by this cytokine.
        Both growth-modulating effects were dose-dependent, however with some saturation.
        Subsequently, we have tested the activity of recombinant human IL-1 receptor
        antagonist (rhIL-1ra) on the tumor growth modulation by rhIL-1alpha. Tumor
        cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of rhIL-1ra and then added
        to the cultures containing rHIL-1alpha. Concentrations of rhIL-1ra were chosen
        to achieve a range between 0.01 and 100 ng/ml which includes a 1000-fold molar
        excess over IL-1alpha. The receptor antagonist was able to block both the
        inhibition and the stimulation of clonal growth of the respective tumor cell
        line by rhIL-1alpha. Furthermore, there was a direct dose dependent relationship
        revealing higher IL-1 antagonism of rhIL-1ra at higher concentrations with
        maximum efficacy at 1000-molar excess concentrations over IL-1alpha. In addition,
        rhIL-1ra alone did not reveal major modulation of the growth of A 375, but
        significantly decreased colony formation of HTB 14. We conclude that rhIL-1ra
        can counteract modulation of clonal growth of human tumor cells by IL-1alpha
        in vitro. Since our report provides first evidence that the stimulation of
        clonal tumor cell growth by IL-1alpha can be blocked by rhIL-1ra, this member
        of the IL-1 cytokine network should be further studied as a possible candidate
        for experimental cancer treatment.", "venue": "International Journal of Oncology",

        "title": "Assemblies of neurons learn to classify well-separated distributions",
        "abstract": "An assembly is a large population of neurons whose synchronous
        firing is hypothesized to represent a memory, concept, word, and other cognitive
        categories. Assemblies are believed to provide a bridge between high-level
        cognitive phenomena and low-level neural activity. Recently, a computational
        system called the Assembly Calculus (AC), with a repertoire of biologically
        plausible operations on assemblies, has been shown capable of simulating arbitrary
        space-bounded computation, but also of simulating complex cognitive phenomena
        such as language, reasoning, and planning. However, the mechanism whereby
        assemblies can mediate learning has not been known. Here we present such a
        mechanism, and prove rigorously that, for simple classification problems defined
        on distributions of labeled assemblies, a new assembly representing each class
        can be reliably formed in response to a few stimuli from the class; this assembly
        is henceforth reliably recalled in response to new stimuli from the same class.
        Furthermore, such class assemblies will be distinguishable as long as the
        respective classes are reasonably separated -- for example, when they are
        clusters of similar assemblies. To prove these results, we draw on random
        graph theory with dynamic edge weights to estimate sequences of activated
        vertices, yielding strong generalizations of previous calculations and theorems
        in this field over the past five years. These theorems are backed up by experiments
        demonstrating the successful formation of assemblies which represent concept
        classes on synthetic data drawn from such distributions, and also on MNIST,
        which lends itself to classification through one assembly per digit. Seen
        as a learning algorithm, this mechanism is entirely online, generalizes from
        very few samples, and requires only mild supervision -- all key attributes
        of learning in a model of the brain.", "venue": "Annual Conference Computational

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive performance in NLP, self-attention networks
        were recently proved to be limited for processing formal languages with hierarchical
        structure, such as Dyck-k, the language consisting of well-nested parentheses
        of k types. This suggested that natural language can be approximated well
        with models that are too weak for formal languages, or that the role of hierarchy
        and recursion in natural language might be limited. We qualify this implication
        by proving that self-attention networks can process Dyck-(k, D), the subset
        of Dyck-k with depth bounded by D, which arguably better captures the bounded
        hierarchical structure of natural language. Specifically, we construct a hard-attention
        network with D+1 layers and O(log k) memory size (per token per layer) that
        recognizes Dyck-(k, D), and a soft-attention network with two layers and O(log
        k) memory size that generates Dyck-(k, D). Experiments show that self-attention
        networks trained on Dyck-(k, D) generalize to longer inputs with near-perfect
        accuracy, and also verify the theoretical memory advantage of self-attention
        networks over recurrent networks.", "venue": "Annual Meeting of the Association

        Our expanding understanding of the brain at the level of neurons and synapses,
        and the level of cognitive phenomena such as language, leaves a formidable
        gap between these two scales. Here we introduce a computational system which
        promises to bridge this gap: the Assembly Calculus. It encompasses operations
        on assemblies of neurons, such as project, associate, and merge, which appear
        to be implicated in cognitive phenomena, and can be shown, analytically as
        well as through simulations, to be plausibly realizable at the level of neurons
        and synapses. We demonstrate the reach of this system by proposing a brain
        architecture for syntactic processing in the production of language, compatible
        with recent experimental results. Assemblies are large populations of neurons
        believed to imprint memories, concepts, words, and other cognitive information.
        We identify a repertoire of operations on assemblies. These operations correspond
        to properties of assemblies observed in experiments, and can be shown, analytically
        and through simulations, to be realizable by generic, randomly connected populations
        of neurons with Hebbian plasticity and inhibition. Assemblies and their operations
        constitute a computational model of the brain which we call the Assembly Calculus,
        occupying a level of detail intermediate between the level of spiking neurons
        and synapses and that of the whole brain. The resulting computational system
        can be shown, under assumptions, to be, in principle, capable of carrying
        out arbitrary computations. We hypothesize that something like it may underlie
        higher human cognitive functions such as reasoning, planning, and language.
        In particular, we propose a plausible brain architecture based on assemblies
        for implementing the syntactic processing of language in cortex, which is
        consistent with recent experimental results.", "venue": "Proceedings of the

        "title": "31 : 2 Wealth Inequality and the Price of Anarchy", "abstract":
        "The price of anarchy quantifies the degradation of social welfare in games
        due to the lack of a centralized authority that can enforce the optimal outcome.
        It is known that, in certain games, such effects can be ameliorated via tolls
        or taxes. This leads to a natural, but largely unexplored, question: what
        is the effect of such transfers on social inequality? We study this question
        in nonatomic congestion games, arguably one of the most thoroughly studied
        settings from the perspective of the price of anarchy. We introduce a new
        model that incorporates the income distribution of the population and captures
        the income elasticity of travel time (i.e., how does loss of time translate
        to lost income). This allows us to argue about the equality of wealth distribution
        both before and after employing a mechanism. We establish that, under reasonable
        assumptions, tolls always increase inequality in symmetric congestion games
        under any reasonable metric of inequality such as the Gini index. We introduce
        the inequity index, a novel measure for quantifying the magnitude of these
        forces towards a more unbalanced wealth distribution and show it has good
        normative properties (robustness to scaling of income, no-regret learning).
        We analyze inequity both in theoretical settings (Pigou\u2019s network under
        various wealth distributions) as well as experimental ones (based on a large
        scale field experiment in Singapore). Finally, we provide an algorithm for
        computing optimal tolls for any point of the trade-off of relative importance
        of efficiency and equality. We conclude with a discussion of our findings
        in the context of theories of justice as developed in contemporary social
        sciences and present several directions for future research. 2012 ACM Subject

        case of such behavior. We propose a new solution concept, the Markov-Conley
        Chain (MCC), which has several favorable properties: It is a simple randomized
        generalization of the pure Nash equilibrium, just like the mixed Nash equilibrium;
        every game has at least one MCC; an MCC is invariant under additive constants
        and positive multipliers of the players'' utilities; there is a polynomial
        number of MCCs in any game, and they can be all computed in polynomial time;
        the MCCs can be shown to be, in a well defined sense, surrogates or traces
        of an important but elusive topological object called the sink chain component
        of the dynamics; finally, it can be shown that a natural game dynamics surely
        ends up at one of the MCCs of the game.", "venue": "SeCO Workshops", "year":

        lack in biological plausibility, chiefly because backpropagation requires
        a variant of plasticity (precise changes of the synaptic weights informed
        by neural events that occur downstream in the neural circuit) that is profoundly
        incompatible with the current understanding of the animal brain. Here we propose
        that backpropagation can happen in evolutionary time, instead of lifetime,
        in what we call neural net evolution (NNE). In NNE the weights of the links
        of the neural net are sparse linear functions of the animal\u2019s genes,
        where each gene has two alleles, 0 and 1. In each generation, a population
        is generated at random based on current allele frequencies, and it is tested
        in the learning task through minibatches. The relative performance of the
        two alleles of each gene is determined, and the allele frequencies are updated
        via the standard population genetics equations for the weak selection regime.
        We prove that, under assumptions, NNE succeeds in learning simple labeling
        functions with high probability, and with polynomially many generations and
        individuals per generation. NNE is also tested on MNIST with encouraging results.

        "title": "Optimal Strategies of Blotto Games: Beyond Convexity", "abstract":
        "The Colonel Blotto game, first introduced by Borel in 1921, is a well-studied
        game theory classic. Two colonels each have a pool of troops that they divide
        simultaneously among a set of battlefields. The winner of each battlefield
        is the colonel who puts more troops in it and the overall utility of each
        colonel is the sum of weights of the battlefields that s/he wins. Over the
        past century, the Colonel Blotto game has found applications in many different
        forms of competition from advertisements to politics to sports. Two main objectives
        have been proposed for this game in the literature: (i) maximizing the guaranteed
        expected payoff, and (ii) maximizing the probability of obtaining a minimum
        payoff u. The former corresponds to the conventional utility maximization
        and the latter concerns scenarios such as elections where the candidates''
        goal is to maximize the probability of getting at least half of the votes
        (rather than the expected number of votes). In this paper, we consider both
        of these objectives and show how it is possible to obtain (almost) optimal
        solutions that have few strategies in their support. One of the main technical
        challenges in obtaining bounded support strategies for the Colonel Blotto
        game is that the solution space becomes non-convex. This prevents us from
        using convex programming techniques in finding optimal strategies which are
        essentially the main tools that are used in the literature. However, we show
        through a set of structural results that the solution space can, interestingly,
        be partitioned into polynomially many disjoint convex polytopes that can be
        considered independently. Coupled with a number of other combinatorial observations,
        this leads to polynomial time approximation schemes for both of the aforementioned
        objectives. We also provide the first complexity result for finding the maximin
        of Blotto-like games: we show that computing the maximin of a generalization
        of the Colonel Blotto game that we call General Colonel Blotto is exponential
        time-complete.", "venue": "ACM Conference on Economics and Computation", "year":

        blockchains reward each miner for one completed block by an amount that is,
        in expectation, proportional to the number of hashes the miner contributed
        to the mining of the block. Is this proportional allocation rule optimal?
        And in what sense? And what other rules are possible? In particular, what
        are the desirable properties that any \"good\" allocation rule should satisfy?
        To answer these questions, we embark on an axiomatic theory of incentives
        in proof-of-work blockchains at the time scale of a single block. We consider
        desirable properties of allocation rules including: symmetry; budget balance
        (weak or strong); sybil-proofness; and various grades of collusion-proofness.
        We show that Bitcoin''s proportional allocation rule is the unique allocation
        rule satisfying a certain system of properties, but this does not hold for
        slightly weaker sets of properties, or when the miners are not risk-neutral.

        How do brains learn? How are intelligence and language achieved in the human

        language for brain computation, based on the assembly hypothesis, first proposed
        by Hebb: the basic unit of memory and computation in the brain is an assembly,
        a sparse distribution over neurons. We show that assemblies can be realized
        efficiently and neuroplausibly by using random projection, inhibition, and
        plasticity. Repeated applications of this RP&C primitive (random projection
        and cap) lead to (1) stable assembly creation through projection; (2) association
        and pattern completion; and finally (3) merge, where two assemblies form a
        higher-level assembly and, eventually, hierarchies. Further, these operations
        are composable, allowing the creation of stable computational circuits and
        structures. We argue that this functionality, in the presence of merge in
        particular, might underlie language and syntax in humans.", "venue": "2019

        "abstract": "The use of monotonicity and Tarski''s theorem in existence proofs
        of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski''s theorem is
        also often used for similar purposes in the context of verification. However,
        there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity
        of finding the fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study
        a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the $d$-dimensional
        grid with sides of length $N$, and their fixed points, as well as the closely
        connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known
        that finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in
        time $\\log^d N$, and we show it requires at least $\\log^2 N$ function evaluations
        already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show
        that the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when the monotone
        function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class PLS of
        problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class
        PPAD. Finding the greatest or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski''s theorem,
        however, requires $d\\cdot N$ steps, and is NP-hard in the white box model.
        For supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such games
        is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding
        the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player
        supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional
        can be solved in $O(\\log N)$ steps. We also observe that computing (approximating)
        the value of Condon''s (Shapley''s) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski
        problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a $\\Omega(\\log^d
        N)$ lower bound for small fixed dimension $d \\geq 3$.", "venue": "Information

        random projection followed by a cap operation 10 (setting to one the k largest
        elements of a vector and everything else to zero), a map believed 11 to be
        an important part of the insect olfactory system, has strong locality sensitivity
        properties. 12 We calculate the asymptotic law whereby the overlap in the
        input vectors is conserved, verify13 ing mathematically this empirical finding.
        We then focus on the far more complex homologous 14 operation in the mammalian
        brain, the creation through successive projections and caps of an 15 assembly
        (roughly, a set of excitatory neurons representing a memory or concept) in
        the presence 16 of recurrent synapses and plasticity. After providing a careful
        definition of assemblies, we prove 17 that the operation of assembly projection
        converges with high probability, over the randomness 18 of synaptic connectivity,
        even if plasticity is relatively small (previous proofs relied on high plas19
        ticity). We also show that assembly projection has itself some locality preservation
        properties. 20 Finally, we propose a large repertoire of assembly operations,
        including associate, merge, recip21 rocal project, and append, each of them
        both biologically plausible and consistent with what we 22 know from experiments,
        and show that this computational system is capable of simulating, again 23
        with high probability, arbitrary computation in a quite natural way. We hope
        that this novel way 24 of looking at brain computation, open-ended and based
        on reasonably mainstream ideas in neu25 roscience, may prove an attractive
        entry point for computer scientists to work on understanding 26 the brain.

        "title": "From Battlefields to Elections: Winning Strategies of Blotto and
        Auditing Games", "abstract": "Mixed strategies are often evaluated based on
        the expected payoff that they guarantee. This is not always desirable. In
        this paper, we consider games for which maximizing the expected payoff deviates
        from the actual goal of the players. To address this issue, we introduce the
        notion of a (u, p)-maxmin strategy which ensures receiving a minimum utility
        of u with probability at least p. We then give approximation algorithms for
        the problem of finding a (u, p)-maxmin strategy for these games. The first
        game that we consider is Colonel Blotto, a well-studied game that was introduced
        in 1921. In the Colonel Blotto game, two colonels divide their troops among
        a set of battlefields. Each battlefield is won by the colonel that puts more
        troops in it. The payoff of each colonel is the weighted number of battlefields
        that she wins. We show that maximizing the expected payoff of a player does
        not necessarily maximize her winning probability for certain applications
        of Colonel Blotto. For example, in presidential elections, the players'' goal
        is to maximize the probability of winning more than half of the votes, rather
        than maximizing the expected number of votes that they get. We give an exact
        algorithm for a natural variant of continuous version of this game. More generally,
        we provide constant and logarithmic approximation algorithms for finding (u,
        p)-maxmin strategies. We also introduce a security game version of Colonel
        Blotto which we call auditing game. It is played between two players, a defender
        and an attacker. The goal of the defender is to prevent the attacker from
        changing the outcome of an instance of Colonel Blotto. Again, maximizing the
        expected payoff of the defender is not necessarily optimal. Therefore we give
        a constant approximation for (u, p)-maxmin strategies.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM

        of passive grasp stability under an external disturbance, that is, the ability
        of a grasp to resist a disturbance through passive responses at the contacts.
        To obtain physically consistent results, such a model must account for friction
        phenomena at each contact; the difficulty is that friction forces depend in
        non-linear fashion on contact behavior (stick or slip). We develop the first
        polynomial-time algorithm which either solves such complex equilibrium constraints
        for two-dimensional grasps, or otherwise concludes that no solution exists.
        To achieve this, we show that the number of possible `slip states'' (where
        each contact is labeled as either sticking or slipping) that must be considered
        is polynomial (in fact quadratic) in the number of contacts, and not exponential
        as previously thought. Our algorithm captures passive response behaviors at
        each contact, while accounting for constraints on friction forces such as
        the maximum dissipation principle.", "venue": "Robotics: Science and Systems",

        Concept for Game Theory", "abstract": "In 1950, Nash proposed a natural equilibrium
        solution concept for games hence called Nash equilibrium, and proved that
        all finite games have at least one. The proof is through a simple yet ingenious
        application of Brouwer\u2019s (or, in another version Kakutani\u2019s) fixed
        point theorem, the most sophisticated result in his era\u2019s topology\u2014in
        fact, recent algorithmic work has established that Nash equilibria are computationally
        equivalent to fixed points. In this paper, we propose a new class of universal
        non-equilibrium solution concepts arising from an important theorem in the
        topology of dynamical systems that was unavailable to Nash. This approach
        starts with both a game and a learning dynamics, defined over mixed strategies.
        The Nash equilibria are fixpoints of the dynamics, but the system behavior
        is captured by an object far more general than the Nash equilibrium that is
        known in dynamical systems theory as chain recurrent set. Informally, once
        we focus on this solution concept\u2014this notion of \u201cthe outcome of
        the game\u201d\u2014every game behaves like a potential game with the dynamics
        converging to these states. In other words, unlike Nash equilibria, this solution
        concept is algorithmic in the sense that it has a constructive proof of existence.
        We characterize this solution for simple benchmark games under replicator
        dynamics, arguably the best known evolutionary dynamics in game theory. For
        (weighted) potential games, the new concept coincides with the fixpoints/equilibria
        of the dynamics. However, in (variants of) zero-sum games with fully mixed
        (i.e., interior) Nash equilibria, it covers the whole state space, as the
        dynamics satisfy specific information theoretic constants of motion. We discuss
        numerous novel computational, as well as structural, combinatorial questions

        "In a recent experiment, a cell in the human medial temporal lobe (MTL) encoding
        one sensory stimulus starts to also respond to a second stimulus following
        a combined experience associating the two. We develop a theoretical model
        predicting that an assembly of cells with exceptionally high synaptic intraconnectivity
        can emerge, in response to a particular sensory experience, to encode and
        abstract that experience. We also show that two such assemblies are modified
        to increase their intersection after a sensory event that associates the two
        corresponding stimuli. The main technical tools employed are random graph
        theory, and Bernoulli approximations. Assembly creation must overcome a computational
        challenge akin to the Densest K-Subgraph problem, namely selecting, from a
        large population of randomly and sparsely interconnected cells, a subset with
        exceptionally high density of interconnections. We identify three mechanisms
        that help achieve this feat in our model: (1) a simple two-stage randomized
        algorithm, and (2) the \"triangle completion bias\" in synaptic connectivity
        and a \"birthday paradox\", while (3) the strength of these connections is
        enhanced through Hebbian plasticity.", "venue": "Information Technology Convergence

        of anarchy quantifies the degradation of social welfare in games due to the
        lack of a centralized authority that can enforce the optimal outcome. At its
        antipodes, mechanism design studies how to ameliorate these effects by incentivizing
        socially desirable behavior and implementing the optimal state as equilibrium.
        In practice, the responsiveness to such measures depends on the wealth of
        each individual. This leads to a natural, but largely unexplored, question.
        Does optimal mechanism design entrench, or maybe even exacerbate, social inequality?
        \nWe study this question in nonatomic congestion games, arguably one of the
        most thoroughly studied settings from the perspectives of price of anarchy
        as well as mechanism design. We introduce a new model that incorporates the
        wealth distribution of the population and captures the income elasticity of
        travel time. This allows us to argue about the equality of wealth distribution
        both before and after employing a mechanism. We start our analysis by establishing
        a broad qualitative result, showing that tolls always increase inequality
        in symmetric congestion games under any reasonable metric of inequality, e.g.,
        the Gini index. Next, we introduce the iniquity index, a novel measure for
        quantifying the magnitude of these forces towards a more unbalanced wealth
        distribution and show it has good normative properties (robustness to scaling
        of income, no-regret learning). We analyze iniquity both in theoretical settings
        (Pigou''s network under various wealth distributions) as well as experimental
        ones (based on a large scale field experiment in Singapore). Finally, we provide
        an algorithm for computing optimal tolls for any point of the trade-off of
        relative importance of efficiency and equality. We conclude with a discussion
        of our findings in the context of theories of justice as developed in contemporary
        social sciences.", "venue": "Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer

        subclasses and important problems. We introduce a syntactic class of problems
        that contains these known subclasses, for the purpose of understanding and
        classifying TFNP problems. This class is defined in terms of the search for
        an error in a concisely-represented formal proof. Finally, the known complexity
        subclasses are based on existence theorems that hold for finite structures;
        from Herbrand''s Theorem, we note that such theorems must apply specifically

        Neurons", "abstract": "Memory traces and associations between them are fundamental
        for cognitive brain function. Neuron recordings suggest that distributed assemblies
        of neurons in the brain serve as memory traces for spatial information, real-world
        items, and concepts. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding neural
        codes for associated memory traces. Some studies suggest the emergence of
        overlaps between assemblies during an association, while others suggest that
        the assemblies themselves remain largely unchanged and new assemblies emerge
        as neural codes for associated memory items. Here we study the emergence of
        neural codes for associated memory items in a generic computational model
        of recurrent networks of spiking neurons with a data-based rule for spike-timing-dependent
        plasticity (STDP). The model depends critically on two parameters, which control
        the excitability of neurons and the scale of initial synaptic weights. By
        modifying these two parameters, the model can reproduce both experimental
        data from the human brain on the fast formation of associations through emergent
        overlaps between assemblies, and rodent data where new neurons are recruited
        to encode the associated memories. Hence our findings suggest that the brain
        can use both of these two neural codes for associations, and dynamically switch
        between them during consolidation.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2017, "referenceCount":

        "It was recently shown \\cite{STV} that satisfiability is polynomially solvable
        when the incidence graph is an interval bipartite graph (an interval graph
        turned into a bipartite graph by omitting all edges within each partite set).
        Here we relax this condition in several directions: First, we show that it
        holds for $k$-interval bigraphs, bipartite graphs which can be converted to
        interval bipartite graphs by adding to each node of one side at most $k$ edges;
        the same result holds for the counting and the weighted maximization version
        of satisfiability. Second, given two linear orders, one for the variables
        and one for the clauses, we show how to find, in polynomial time, the smallest
        $k$ such that there is a $k$-interval bigraph compatible with these two orders.
        On the negative side we prove that, barring complexity collapses, no such
        extensions are possible for CSPs more general than satisfiability. We also
        show NP-hardness of recognizing 1-interval bigraphs.", "venue": "International

        "Johann Gutenberg\u2019s discovery allowing him to print books by putting
        together metallic pieces revolutionized the world. It made books widely accessible.
        It affected literacy, education, political thought, humanities and science.
        But there are others who think that not typography but algorithms was the
        key development. How to deal with large numbers (of critical importance to
        accounting, business, trade, science, and engineering) was not a trivial matter.
        Indeed, consider the question how to add or multiply Roman numerals (say add
        MCDXII and DCCCXII)?1 And there are more complex problems, too, like finding
        square roots, approximating irrational numbers, etc. The discovery of positional
        systems was a major breakthrough. The sexagesimal system was invented by Summerians
        around 2000 BCE. The decimal system was known (or was in some use) very early
        on (perhaps as early as 3000 BCE) but in its modern form, with 0 (zero) was
        invented (popularized) around 600 CE in India (c. 598-670, Brahmagupta explains
        the Hindu-Arabic numerals). Important to us is the fact that Muhammad ibn
        Musa al-Kwarizmi (the first half of the 9th century) for the first time described
        and popularized the decimal system as well as basic procedures for manipulating
        decimal numbers outside of India. These procedures were mechanical, precise,
        efficient and correct. Ultimately, a few centuries later, Europe adopted the
        system and the rest is history. Mathematics and science took off. The terms
        algorism and more modern algorithm reflect the name of al-Kwarizmi \u2014

        and Topology", "abstract": "Nash''s universal existence theorem for his notion
        of equilibria was essentially an ingenious application of fixed point theorems,
        the most sophisticated result in his era''s topology --- in fact, recent algorithmic
        work has established that Nash equilibria are in fact computationally equivalent
        to fixed points. Here, we shift focus to universal non-equilibrium solution
        concepts that arise from an important theorem in the topology of dynamical
        systems that was unavailable to Nash. This approach takes as input both a
        game and a learning dynamic, defined over mixed strategies. Nash equilibria
        are guaranteed to be fixed points of such dynamics; however, the system behavior
        is captured by a more general object that is known in dynamical systems theory
        as chain recurrent set. Informally, once we focus on this solution concept,
        every game behaves like a potential game with the dynamic converging to these
        states. We characterize this solution for simple benchmark games under replicator
        dynamics, arguably the best known evolutionary dynamic in game theory. For
        potential games it coincides with the notion of equilibrium; however, in simple
        zero sum games, it can cover the whole state space. We discuss numerous novel

        "title": "Computation as a Scientific Weltanschauung (Invited Talk)", "abstract":
        "Computation as a mechanical reality is young - almost exactly seventy years
        of age - and yet the spirit of computation can be traced several millennia
        back. Any moderately advanced civilization depends on calculation (for inventory,
        taxation, navigation, land partition, among many others) - our civilization
        is the first one that is conscious of this reliance. \n \nComputation has
        also been central to science for centuries. This is most immediately apparent
        in the case of mathematics: the idea of the algorithm as a mathematical object
        of some significance was pioneered by Euclid in the 4th century BC, and advanced
        by Archimedes a century later. But computation plays an important role in
        virtually all sciences: natural, life, or social. Implicit algorithmic processes
        are present in the great objects of scientific inquiry - the cell, the universe,
        the market, the brain - as well as in the models developed by scientists over
        the centuries for studying them. This brings about a very recent - merely
        a few decades old - mode of scientific inquiry, which is sometime referred
        to as the lens of computation: When students of computation revisit central
        problems in science from the computational viewpoint, often unexpected progress
        results. This has happened in statistical physics through the study of phase
        transitions in terms of the convergence of Markov chain-Monte Carlo algorithms,
        and in quantum mechanics through quantum computing. \n \nThis talk will focus
        on three other manifestations of this phenomenon. Almost a decade ago, ideas
        and methodologies from computational complexity revealed a subtle conceptual
        flaw in the solution concept of Nash equilibrium, which lies at the foundations
        of modern economic thought. In the study of evolution, a new understanding
        of century-old questions has been achieved through surprisingly algorithmic
        ideas. Finally, current work in theoretical neuroscience suggests that the
        algorithmic point of view may be invaluable in the central scientific question
        of our era, namely understanding how behavior and cognition emerge from the
        structure and activity of neurons and synapses.", "venue": "Scandinavian Workshop

        study Boolean functions of an arbitrary number of input variables that can
        be realized by simple iterative constructions based on constant-size primitives.
        This restricted type of construction needs little global coordination or control
        and thus is a candidate for neurally feasible computation. Valiant''s construction
        of a majority function can be realized in this manner and, as we show, can
        be generalized to any uniform threshold function. We study the rate of convergence,
        finding that while linear convergence to the correct function can be achieved
        for any threshold using a fixed set of primitives, for quadratic convergence,
        the size of the primitives must grow as the threshold approaches 0 or 1. We
        also study finite realizations of this process and the learnability of the
        functions realized. We show that the constructions realized are accurate outside
        a small interval near the target threshold, where the size of the construction
        grows as the inverse square of the interval width. This phenomenon, that errors
        are higher closer to thresholds (and thresholds closer to the boundary are
        harder to represent), is a well-known cognitive finding.", "venue": "Annual

        algorithms", "abstract": "Carpooling has been long deemed a promising approach
        to better utilizing existing transportation infrastructure. However, there
        are several reasons carpooling is still not the preferred mode of commute
        in the United States: first, complex human factors, including time constraints
        and not having right incentive structures, discourage the sharing of rides;
        second, algorithmic and technical barriers inhibit the development of online
        services for matching riders. In this work, we study algorithms for 3+ high-occupancy
        vehicle (HOV) lanes, which permit vehicles that hold three or more people.
        We focus on the technical barriers but also address the aforementioned human
        factors. We formulate the HOV3 Carpool problem, and show that it is NP-Complete.
        We thus pose the relaxed problem HOV3- Carpool problem, allowing groups of
        up to size three, and propose several methods for solving the problem of finding
        globally optimal carpool groups that may utilize these 3- HOV lanes. Our methods
        include local search, integer programming, and dynamic programming. Our local
        search methods include sampling-based (hill-climbing and simulated annealing),
        classical neighborhood search, and a hybrid random neighborhood search. We
        assess the methods numerically in terms of objective value and scalability.
        Our findings show that our sampling-based local search methods scale up to
        100K agents, thereby improving upon related previous work (which studies up
        to 1000 agents). The hill climbing local search method converges significantly
        closer and faster towards a naive lower bound on cumulative carpooling cost.",

        "title": "Does Information Revelation Improve Revenue?", "abstract": "We study
        the problem of optimal auction design in a valuation model, explicitly motivated
        by online ad auctions, in which there is two-way informational asymmetry,
        in the sense that private information is available to both the seller (the
        item type) and the bidders (their type), and the value of each bidder for
        the item depends both on his own and the item''s type. Importantly, we allow
        arbitrary auction formats involving, potentially, several rounds of signaling
        from the seller and decisions by the bidders, and seek to find the optimum
        co-design of signaling and auction (we call this optimum the \"optimum augmented
        auction\"). We characterize exactly the optimum augmented auction for our
        valuation model by establishing its equivalence with a multi-item Bayesian
        auction with additive bidders. Surprisingly, in the optimum augmented auction
        there is no signaling whatsoever, and in fact the seller need not access the
        available information about the item type until after the bidder chooses his
        bid. Suboptimal solutions to this problem, which have appeared in the recent
        literature, are shown to correspond to well-studied ways to approximate multi-item
        auctions by simpler formats, such as grand-bundling (this corresponds to Myerson''s
        auction without any information revelation), selling items separately (this
        corresponds to Myerson''s auction preceded by full information revelation
        as in [Fu et al. 2012]), and fractional partitioning (this corresponds to
        Myerson''s auction preceded by optimal signaling). Consequently, all these
        solutions are separated by large approximation gaps from the optimum revenue.",

        "abstract": "We propose a model for binding of variables such as the thematic
        role of a word in a sentence or episode (e.g., agent or patient), to concrete
        fillers (e.g., a word or concept). Our model is based on recent experimental
        data about corresponding processes in the human brain. One source of information
        are electrode recordings from the human brain, which suggest that concepts
        are represented in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) through sparse sets of neurons
        (assemblies). Another source of information are fMRI recordings from the human
        brain, which suggest that subregions of the temporal cortex are dedicated
        to the representation of specific roles (e.g., subject or object) of concepts
        in a sentence or visually presented episode. We propose that quickly recruited
        assemblies of neurons in these subregions act as pointers to previously created
        assemblies that represent concepts. We provide a proof of principle that the
        resulting model for binding through assembly pointers can be implemented in
        networks of spiking neurons, and supports basic operations of brain computations,
        such as structured information retrieval and copying of information. We also
        show that salient features of fMRI data on neural activity during structured
        information retrieval can be reproduced by the proposed model.", "venue":

        more than a decade ago [5], are neurons in the brain of mammals that fire
        when the animal is located near certain specific points in its familiar terrain.
        Intriguingly, these points form, for a single cell, a two-dimensional triangular
        grid, not unlike our Figure 3. Grid cells are widely believed to be involved
        in path integration, that is, the maintenance of a location state through
        the summation of small displacements. We provide theoretical evidence for
        this assertion by showing that cells with grid-like tuning curves are indeed
        well adapted for the path integration task. In particular we prove that, in
        one dimension under Gaussian noise, the sensitivity of measuring small displacements
        is maximized by a population of neurons whose tuning curves are near-sinusoids
        -- that is to say, with peaks forming a one-dimensional grid. We also show
        that effective computation of the displacement is possible through a second
        population of cells whose sinusoid tuning curves are in phase difference from
        the first. In two dimensions, under additional assumptions it can be shown
        that measurement sensitivity is optimized by the product of two sinusoids,
        again yielding a grid-like pattern. We discuss the connection of our results

        Functions", "abstract": "The Adaptive Seeding problem is an algorithmic challenge
        motivated by influence maximization in social networks: One seeks to select
        among certain accessible nodes in a network, and then select, adaptively,
        among neighbors of those nodes as they become accessible in order to maximize
        a global objective function. More generally, adaptive seeding is a stochastic
        optimization framework where the choices in the first stage affect the realizations
        in the second stage, over which we aim to optimize. Our main result is a (1
        -- 1/e)2-approximation for the adaptive seeding problem for any monotone submodular
        function. While adaptive policies are often approximated via non-adaptive
        policies, our algorithm is based on a novel method we call locally-adaptive
        policies. These policies combine a non-adaptive global structure, with local
        adaptive optimizations. This method enables the (1 -- 1/e)2-approximation
        for general monotone submodular functions and circumvents some of the impossibilities
        associated with non-adaptive policies. We also introduce a fundamental problem
        in submodular optimization that may be of independent interest: given a ground
        set of elements where every element appears with some small probability, find
        a set of expected size at most k that has the highest expected value over
        the realization of the elements. We show a surprising result: there are classes
        of monotone submodular functions (including coverage) that can be approximated
        almost optimally as the probability vanishes. For general monotone submodular
        functions we show via a reduction from P lanted -C lique that approximations
        for this problem are not likely to be obtainable. This optimization problem
        is an important tool for adaptive seeding via non-adaptive policies, and its
        hardness motivates the introduction of locally-adaptive policies we use in
        the main result.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms", "year":

        "title": "Strategic Classification", "abstract": "Machine learning relies
        on the assumption that unseen test instances of a classification problem follow
        the same distribution as observed training data. However, this principle can
        break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about
        the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing
        information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes
        in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior
        -- often referred to as gaming -- the performance of the classifier may deteriorate
        sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning
        methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known
        as Goodhart''s law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms
        for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming. We model classification
        as a sequential game between a player named \"Jury\" and a player named \"Contestant.\"
        Jury designs a classifier, and Contestant receives an input to the classifier
        drawn from a distribution. Before being classified, Contestant may change
        his input based on Jury''s classifier. However, Contestant incurs a cost for
        these changes according to a cost function. Jury''s goal is to achieve high
        classification accuracy with respect to Contestant''s original input and some
        underlying target classification function, assuming Contestant plays best
        response. Contestant''s goal is to achieve a favorable classification outcome
        while taking into account the cost of achieving it. For a natural class of
        \"separable\" cost functions, and certain generalizations, we obtain computationally
        efficient learning algorithms which are near optimal, achieving a classification
        error that is arbitrarily close to the theoretical minimum. Surprisingly,
        our algorithms are efficient even on concept classes that are computationally
        hard to learn. For general cost functions, designing an approximately optimal
        strategy-proof classifier, for inverse-polynomial approximation, is NP-hard.",

        "Bayesian equilibria of simultaneous auctions for individual items have been
        explored recently [Christodoulou et al. 2008; Bhawalkar and Roughgarden 2011;
        Hassidim et al. 2011; Feldman et al. 2013] as an alternative to the well-known
        complexity issues plaguing combinatorial auctions with incomplete information,
        and some strong positive results have been shown about their performance.
        We point out some very serious complexity obstacles to this approach: Computing
        a Bayesian equilibrium in such auctions is hard for PP --- a complexity class
        between the polynomial hierarchy and PSPACE --- and even finding an approximate
        such equilibrium is as hard as NP, for some small approximation ratio (additive
        or multiplicative); therefore, the assumption that such equilibria will be
        arrived at by rational agents is quite problematic. In fact, even recognizing
        a Bayesian Nash equilibrium is intractable. Furthermore, these results hold
        even if bidder valuations are quite benign: Only one bidder valuation in our
        construction is unit demand or monotone submodular, while all others are additive.
        We also explore the possibility of favorable price of anarchy results for
        no-regret dynamics of the Bayesian simultaneous auctions game, and identify
        complexity obstacles there as well.", "venue": "ACM Conference on Economics

        biology was founded on the mathematical tools of statistics and physics. We
        believe there are productive connections to be made with the younger field
        of theoretical computer science, which shares with it an interest in complexity
        and functionality. In this paper, we find that the mathematical description
        of evolution in the presence of sexual recombination and weak selection is
        equivalent to a repeated game between genes played according to the multiplicative
        weight updates algorithm, an algorithm that has surprised computer scientists
        time and again in its usefulness. This equivalence is informative for the
        pursuit of two key problems in evolution: the role of sex and the maintenance
        of variation. Even the most seasoned students of evolution, starting with
        Darwin himself, have occasionally expressed amazement that the mechanism of
        natural selection has produced the whole of Life as we see it around us. There
        is a computational way to articulate the same amazement: \u201cWhat algorithm
        could possibly achieve all this in a mere three and a half billion years?\u201d
        In this paper we propose an answer: We demonstrate that in the regime of weak
        selection, the standard equations of population genetics describing natural
        selection in the presence of sex become identical to those of a repeated game
        between genes played according to multiplicative weight updates (MWUA), an
        algorithm known in computer science to be surprisingly powerful and versatile.
        MWUA maximizes a tradeoff between cumulative performance and entropy, which

        introduce a dynamic mechanism design problem in which the designer wants to

        some point in the future. The agent''s joint distribution of valuations for
        the two items is known, and the agent knows the valuation for the current
        item (but not for the one in the future). The designer seeks to maximize expected
        revenue, and the auction must be deterministic, truthful, and ex post individually
        rational. The optimum mechanism involves a protocol whereby the seller elicits
        the buyer''s current valuation, and based on the bid makes two take-it-or-leave-it

        The theory of algorithms and complexity, of which the basic concepts and results
        are being reviewed here, is an important and consequential domain of mathematical
        investigation that is unfamiliar to most PNAS readers. Furthermore, in the
        second half of the article we focus on recent and current research, applying
        these concepts and results to help elucidate certain central theoretical problems
        in the social and life sciences, including market equilibria and the theory
        of evolution. Algorithms, perhaps together with Moore\u2019s law, compose
        the engine of the information technology revolution, whereas complexity\u2014the
        antithesis of algorithms\u2014is one of the deepest realms of mathematical
        investigation. After introducing the basic concepts of algorithms and complexity,
        and the fundamental complexity classes P (polynomial time) and NP (nondeterministic
        polynomial time, or search problems), we discuss briefly the P vs. NP problem.
        We then focus on certain classes between P and NP which capture important
        phenomena in the social and life sciences, namely the Nash equlibrium and
        other equilibria in economics and game theory, and certain processes in population
        genetics and evolution. Finally, an algorithm known as multiplicative weights
        update (MWU) provides an algorithmic interpretation of the evolution of allele
        frequencies in a population under sex and weak selection. All three of these
        equivalences are rife with domain-specific implications: The concept of Nash
        equilibrium may be less universal\u2014and therefore less compelling\u2014than
        has been presumed; selection on gene interactions may entail the maintenance
        of genetic variation for longer periods than selection on single alleles predicts;
        whereas MWU can be shown to maximize, for each gene, a convex combination
        of the gene\u2019s cumulative fitness in the population and the entropy of
        the allele distribution, an insight that may be pertinent to the maintenance

        the most seasoned students of evolution, starting with Darwin himself, have
        occasionally expressed amazement at the fact that the mechanism of natural
        selection has produced the whole of Life as we see it around us. From a computational
        perspective, it is natural to marvel at evolution''s solution to the problems
        of robotics, vision and theorem proving! What, then, is the complexity of
        evolution, viewed as an algorithm? One answer to this question is 10^{12},
        roughly the number of sequential steps or generations from the earliest single
        celled creatures to today''s Homo Sapiens. To put this into perspective, the
        processor of a modern cell phone can perform 10^{12} steps in less than an
        hour. Another answer is 10^30, the degree of parallelism, roughly the maximum
        number of organisms living on the Earth at any time. Perhaps the answer should
        be the product of the two numbers, roughly 10^42, to reflect the total work
        done by evolution, viewed as a parallel algorithm. \n \nHere we argue, interpreting
        our recently published paper, that none of the above answers is really correct.
        Viewing evolution as an algorithm poses an additional challenge: recombination.
        Even if evolution succeeds in producing a particularly good solution (a highly
        fit individual), its offspring would only inherit half its genes, and therefore
        appear unlikely to be a good solution. This is the core of the problem of
        explaining the role of sex in evolution, known as the \"queen of problems
        in evolutionary biology\". \n \nThe starting point is the diffusion-equation-based
        approach of theoretical population geneticists, who analyze the changing allele
        frequencies (over the generations) in the gene pool, consisting of the aggregate
        of the genetic variants (or \"alleles\") over all genes (or \"loci\") and
        over all individuals in a species. Taking this viewpoint to its logical conclusion,
        rather than acting on individuals or species or genes, evolution acts on this
        gene pool, or genetic soup, by making it more \"potent\", in the sense that
        it increases the expected fitness of genotype drawn randomly from this soup.
        Moreover, for much genetic variation, this soup may be assumed to be in the
        regime of weak selection, a regime where the probability of occurrence of
        a certain genotype involving various alleles at different loci is simply the
        product of the probabilities of each of its alleles. In this regime, we show
        that evolution in the regime of weak selection can be formulated as a game,
        where the recombining loci are the players, the alleles in those loci are
        possible moves or actions of each player, and the expected payoff of each
        player-locus is precisely the organism''s expected fitness across the genotypes
        that are present in the population. Moreover, the dynamics specified by the
        diffusion equations of theoretical population geneticists is closely approximated
        by the dynamics of multiplicative weight updates (MWUA). \n \nThe algorithmic
        connection to MWUA brings with it new insights for evolutionary biology, specifically,
        into the question of how genetic diversity is maintained in the presence of
        natural selection. For this it is useful to consider a dual view of MWUA,
        which expresses \"what each gene is optimizing\" as it plays the game. Remarkably
        this turns out to be a particular convex combination of the entropy of its
        distribution over alleles and cumulative expected fitness. This sheds new
        light on the maintenance of diversity in evolution. \n \nAll of this suggests
        that the complexity of evolution should indeed be viewed as 10^12, but for
        a subtle reason. It is the number of steps of multiplicative weight updates
        carried out on allele frequencies in the genetic soup. A closer examination
        of this reveals further that the accurate tracking of allele frequencies over
        the generations requires the simulation of a quadratic dynamical system (two
        parents for each offspring). Moreover the simulation of even simple quadratic
        dynamical systems is known to be PSPACE-hard. This suggests that the tracking
        of allele frequencies might require large population sizes for each species,
        putting into perspective the number 10^30. Finally, it is worth noting that
        in this view there is a primacy to recombination or sex, which serve to provide
        robustness to the mechanism of evolution, as well as the framework within
        which MWUA operates.", "venue": "Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical

        introduce a dynamic mechanism design problem in which the designer wants to
        offer for sale an item to an agent, and another item to the same agent at

        for the two items is known, and the agent knows the valuation for the current
        item (but not for the one in the future). The designer seeks to maximize expected
        revenue, and the auction must be deterministic, truthful, and ex post individually
        rational. The optimum mechanism involves a protocol whereby the seller elicits
        the buyer\u2019s current valuation, and based on the bid makes two take-it-or-leave-it

        "title": "Multiplicative updates in coordination games and the theory of evolution",
        "abstract": "In this paper we point out a new and unexpected connection between
        three fields: Evolution Theory, Game Theory, and Algorithms.\n In particular,
        we study the standard equations of population genetics for Evolution, in the
        presence of recombination (sex), focusing on the important special case of
        weak selection [1,2] in which all fitness values are assumed to be close to
        one another. Weak selection is the mathematical regime capturing the widely
        accepted Neutral Theory proposed by Kimura in the 1970s [3], hypothesizing
        that evolution proceeds for the most part not by substantial increases in
        fitness but by essentially random drift. We show that in this regime evolution
        through natural selection and sex is tantamount to a game played through the
        multiplicative weight updates game dynamics [4]. The players of the game are
        the genes (genetic loci), the strategies available to each player are the
        alleles of the gene, and the probabilities whereby a player plays a strategy
        is the strategy''s frequency in the population. The utility to each player/gene
        of each strategy profile is the fitness of the corresponding genotype (organism).
        That is, the game is a coordination game between genes, in which the players''
        interests are perfectly aligned. Importantly, the utility maximized in this
        game, as well as the amount by which each allele is boosted, is precisely
        the allele''s mixability, or average fitness, a quantity recently proposed
        in [5] as a novel concept that is crucial in understanding natural selection
        under sex, thus providing a rigorous demonstration of that insight.\n We also
        establish a result regarding the maintenance of genetic diversity (multiplicity
        of alleles per gene). We prove that the equilibria in two-person coordination
        games are likely to have large supports, and thus genetic diversity need not
        suffer much at equilibrium. Establishing large supports involves answering
        through a novel technique the following question: what is the probability
        that for a random square matrix $A$ (with entries drawn independently from
        smooth distributions that are symmetric around zero) both systems Ax=1 and
        ATy=1 have positive solutions? The proof is through a simple potential function
        argument. Both the question and the technique may be of broader interest.\n
        It has often seemed astonishing --- even to experienced students of Evolution,
        Darwin included --- that the crude mechanism of natural selection is responsible
        for producing the dazzling variety of Life around us. The present mathematical
        connection of Evolution with the multiplicative weight updates algorithm ---
        a technique that has surprised our field time and again with its fantastic
        effectiveness and versatility --- may carry some explanatory force in this
        regard.", "venue": "Information Technology Convergence and Services", "year":

        usually uses only the motion towards the target behavior, and generates globally
        optimal paths. In the second environment the obstacles are larger (Figure
        10). Therefore the robot has a larger probability to activate the boundary-following
        behavior. In this environment there are more cases where a large part of an
        obstacle is occluded. In these cases the locally shortest path may diier signiicantly
        from the globally shortest one (Figure 10). Thus the generated path depends
        more on the local arrangement of the obstacles. We consider these examples

        based globally convergent algorithm for navigating a point robot in an unknown
        three-dimensional polyhedral environment. 3DBug uses 3D range data in the
        most reactive fashion possible and plans 3D motion throughout the navigation
        process. Thus 3DBug provides a new and eeective Bug-type navigation algorithm
        for three-dimensions. During motion towards the target, the robot follows
        the locally shortest path, and we presented an eecient method for generating
        it. We also presented a novel method for estimating the locally shortest path,
        in time which is linear in \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount":

        for production because they rule out economies of scale. We take a complexity-theoretic
        look at economies with non-convex production. It is known that in such markets
        equilibrium prices may not exist; we show that it is an intractable problem
        to achieve Pareto efficiency, the fundamental objective achieved by equilibrium
        prices. The same is true for core efficiency or any one of an array of concepts
        of stability, with the degree of intractability ranging from F \u03942P-completeness
        to PSPACE-hardness. We also identify a novel phenomenon that we call complexity
        equilibrium in which agents quiesce, not because there is no way for any one
        of group of them to improve their situation, but because discovering the changes
        necessary for (individual or group) improvement is intractable. In fact, we
        exhibit a somewhat natural distribution of economies that has an average-case

        "abstract": "When agents with independent priors bid for a single item, Myerson\u2019s
        optimal auction maximizes expected revenue, whereas Vickrey\u2019s second-price
        auction optimizes social welfare. We address the natural question of trade-offs,
        auctions that optimize revenue without losing too much welfare, say. If one
        allows for randomized mechanisms, it is easy to see that there are polynomial-time
        mechanisms that achieve any point in the trade-off (the Pareto curve) between
        revenue and welfare. We ask the question of whether one can achieve the same
        guarantees using deterministic mechanisms. We provide a negative answer to
        this question by showing that this is a weakly NP-hard problem. On the positive
        side, we provide polynomial-time deterministic mechanisms that approximate
        with arbitrary precision any point of the trade-off between these two fundamental
        objectives for the case of two bidders, even when the valuations are correlated
        arbitrarily. The major problem left open by our work is whether there is such
        an algorithm for independent valuation distributions and three or more bidders.",

        "The existence of incentive-compatible, computationally-efficient mechanisms
        for combinatorial auctions with good approximation ratios is the paradigmatic
        problem in algorithmic mechanism design. It is believed that, in many cases,
        good approximations for combinatorial auctions may be unattainable due to
        an inherent clash between truthfulness and computational efficiency. In this
        paper, we prove the first computational-complexity in-approximability results
        for incentive-compatible mechanisms for combinatorial auctions. Our results
        are tight, hold for the important class of VCG-based mechanisms, and are based
        on the complexity assumption that NP has no polynomial-size circuits. We show
        two different techniques to obtain such lower bounds: one for deterministic
        mechanisms that attains optimal dependence on the number of players and number
        of items, and one that also applies to a class of randomized mechanisms and
        attains optimal dependence on the number of players. Both techniques are based

        out an error on page 10, lines 13-14 of our paper \u201cComputing Correlated
        Equilibria in Multi-Player Games\u201d (Journal of the ACM, 2008). The incorrect
        phrase is \u201c...which contradicts our assumption that the violating y is
        within the current ellipsoid\u201d. This conclusion would be valid for the
        bounding ellipsoid used for the original dual program (D), but could be incorrect
        for the larger bounding ellipsoid that is required for the modified dual program
        (D\u2019) because of its increased bit complexity. This error is not serious
        and can be rectified in various ways. Stein, Parillo, and Ozdaglar proposed
        explicitly bounding the variables of the original dual program (D) by an appropriately
        large number. The most elegant fix, described next, was suggested by Albert
        Xin Jiang and Kevin Leyton-Brown (see their arXiv article 1011.0253). Recall
        that Lemma 3.2 shows that, given a candidate dual solution y \u2265 0, one
        can compute efficiently a product distribution x over outcomes such that xU
        y = 0. Then, by going through the players one at a time and repeatedly using
        the method of conditional expectations, x can be converted efficiently into
        a pure strategy profile s such that U s y \u2265 0 (where U s is the constraint
        of (D) that corresponds to s). This constraint is violated at y. Proceeding
        as in the paper but with these \u201cpurified\u201d violated constraints yields
        a modified dual (D\u2019) with bit complexity no larger than that of (D),
        and the bounding ellipsoid for (D) can now be safely reused for (D\u2019).
        Solving the new modified primal (P\u2019) yields a correlated equilibrium.
        This corrected algorithm computes a correlated equilibrium that has polynomial
        support, an improvement over the less explicit \u201cpolynomial combination
        of products\u201d representation that was produced by the original algorithm.",

        Award, named after the late Alberto O. Mendelzon, in recognition of his scientific
        legacy, and his service and dedication to the database community. Mendelzon
        was an international leader in database theory, whose pioneering and fundamental
        work has inspired and influenced both database theoreticians and practitioners,
        and continues to be applied in a variety of advanced settings. He served the
        database community in many ways; in particular, he served as the General Chair
        of the PODS conference, and was instrumental in bringing together the PODS
        and SIGMOD conferences. He also was an outstanding educator, who guided the
        research of numerous doctoral students and postdoctoral fellows. The Award
        is to be awarded each year to a paper or a small number of papers published
        in the PODS proceedings ten years prior, that had the most impact (in terms
        of research, methodology, or transfer to practice) over the intervening decade.

        introduce and evaluate several new models of network growth. Our models are

        In all these models nodes arrive one by one, and each node is connected to
        previous nodes by optimizing a trade-off between a geometric objective (\"last
        mile cost\") and a topological objective (\"position in the network\"). Our
        new models differ from the original FKP model in directions inspired by the
        real Internet: two or more edges are attached to each arriving node (while
        the FKP model produces a tree); these edges are chosen according to various
        criteria such as robustness; edges may be added to the network between old
        nodes; or only certain \"fertile\" nodes (an attribute that changes dynamically)
        are capable of attracting new edges. We evaluate these models, and compare
        them with the graph of the Internet''s autonomous systems, with respect to

        "title": "Internet routing and internet service provision", "abstract": "The
        recent development and expansion of the Internet has created many technical
        challenges in several diverse research areas. In this thesis, we study recent
        problems arising in the area of Internet routing and Internet service provision.
        In the area of Internet routing, we analyze properties of the selfish routing
        model, which is a mathematical model of users selfishly routing traffic in
        a network without regard to their effect on other users. Additionally, we
        study the properties of various random graph models which have been used to
        model the Internet, and utilize the properties of graphs generated by those
        random models to develop simple compact routing schemes, which can allow network
        routing without having each node store very much information. In the area
        of Internet service provision, we study an online bipartite matching problem,
        in which a set of servers seeks to provide service to arriving clients with
        as little interruption as possible. The central theme of this thesis is to
        analyze precise mathematical models of Internet routing and Internet service
        provision, and in those models, we show certain properties hold or derive
        algorithms which work with high probability. \nThe first model we study is
        the selfish routing model. In the selfish routing model, we analyze the efficiency
        of users selfishly routing traffic and study a counterintuitive phenomenon
        known as Braess''s Paradox, which states that adding a link to a network with
        selfish routing may actually increase the latency for all users. We produce
        tight and nearly tight bounds on the maximum increase in latency that can
        occur due to Braess''s Paradox in single-commodity and multicommodity networks,
        respectively. We also produce the first nearly tight bounds on the maximum
        latency that can occur when traffic is routed selfishly in multicommodity
        networks, relative to the maximum latency that occurs when traffic is routed
        optimally. \nIn the second part of the thesis, we study random graph models
        which have been used to model the Internet, and look for properties of graphs
        generated by those models, which can be used to derive simple compact routing
        schemes. The goal of compact routing is to derive algorithms which minimize
        the information stored by nodes in the network, while maintaining the ability
        of all nodes to route packets to each other along relatively short paths.
        In this research area, we show that graphs generated by several random graph
        models used to model the Internet (e.g. the preferential attachment model),
        can be decomposed in a novel manner, which allows compact routing to be achieved
        easily. Along the way, we also prove that a Polya urns random process has
        good load balancing properties, which may be of independent interest. \nIn
        the last part of the thesis, we study an online bipartite matching problem,
        which models a problem occurring in the area of Internet service provision.
        In our online bipartite matching problem, we imagine that we have some servers
        capable of providing some service, and clients arrive one at a time to request
        service from a subset of servers capable of servicing their request. The goal
        of the problem is to assign the arriving clients to servers capable of servicing
        their requests, all while minimizing the number of times that a client needs
        to be switched from one server to another server. Although prior worst case
        analysis for this problem has not yielded interesting results, we show tight
        bounds on the number of times clients need to be switched under a few natural
        models. \nAs we analyze these problems arising in the Internet from a precise
        mathematical perspective, we also seek to reflect on the process used to solve
        mathematical problems. Although the thought process can sometimes be difficult
        to describe, in one case, we attempt to provide a step-by-step account of
        how the final result was proved, and attempt to describe a high level algorithm,
        which summarizes the methodology that used to prove it.", "venue": "", "year":

        "title": "On oblivious PTAS''s for nash equilibrium", "abstract": "If a class
        of games is known to have a Nash equilibrium with probability values that
        are either zero or \u03a9(1) -- and thus with support of bounded size -- then
        obviously this equilibrium can be found exhaustively in polynomial time. Somewhat
        surprisingly, we show that there is a PTAS for the class of games whose equilibria
        are guaranteed to have small --- O(1/n) -- values, and therefore large --
        \u03a9(n) -- supports. We also point out that there is a PTAS for games with
        sparse payoff matrices, a family for which the exact problem is known to be
        PPAD-complete [Chen, Deng, Teng 2006]. Both algorithms are of a special kind
        that we call oblivious: The algorithm just samples a fixed distribution on
        pairs of mixed strategies, and the game is only used to determine whether
        the sampled strategies comprise an \u03b5-Nash equilibrium; the answer is
        \"yes\" with inverse polynomial probability (in the second case, the algorithm
        is actually deterministic). These results bring about the question: Is there
        an oblivious PTAS for finding a Nash equilibrium in general games? We answer
        this question in the negative; our lower bound comes close to the quasi-polynomial
        upper bound of [Lipton, Markakis, Mehta 2003]. Another recent PTAS for anonymous
        games [Daskalakis, Papadimitriou 2007 and 2008, Daskalakis 2008] is also oblivious
        in a weaker sense appropriate for this class of games (it samples from a fixed
        distribution on unordered collections of mixed strategies), but its running
        time is exponential in 1/\u03b5. We prove that any oblivious PTAS for anonymous
        games with two strategies and three player types must have 1/\u03b5\u03b1
        in the exponent of the running time for some \u03b1 \u2265 1/3, rendering
        the algorithm in [Daskalakis 2008] (which works with any bounded number of
        player types) essentially optimal within oblivious algorithms. In contrast,
        we devise a poly n \u2022 (1/\u03b5)O(\\log2(1/\u03b5)) non-oblivious PTAS
        for anonymous games with two strategies and any bounded number of player types.
        The key idea of our algorithm is to search not over unordered sets of mixed
        strategies, but over a carefully crafted set of collections of the first O(log
        1/\u03b5) moments of the distribution of the number of players playing strategy
        1 at equilibrium. The algorithm works because of a probabilistic result of
        more general interest that we prove: the total variation distance between
        two sums of independent indicator random variables decreases exponentially
        with the number of moments of the two sums that are equal, independent of
        the number of indicators.", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of Computing",

        of subgraphs covering the n nodes such that all pairs of subgraphs intersect;
        we seek linked decompositions such that all subgraphs have about \u221an vertices,
        logarithmic diameter, and each vertex of the graph belongs to either one or
        two subgraphs. A linked decomposition enables many control and management
        functions to be implemented locally, such as resource sharing, maintenance
        of distributed directory structures, deadlock-free routing, failure recovery
        and load balancing, without requiring any node to maintain information about
        the state of the network outside the subgraphs to which it belongs. Linked
        decompositions also enable efficient routing, schemes with small routing tables,

        further balls have arrived and stay roughly balanced, regardless of how the

        "title": "The complexity of nash equilibria", "abstract": "The Internet owes
        much of its complexity to the large number of entities that run it and use
        it. These entities have different and potentially conflicting interests, so
        their interactions are of a strategic nature. Therefore, to understand these
        interactions, concepts from Economics and, most importantly, Game Theory are
        necessary. An important such concept is the notion of Nash equilibrium, which
        provides us with a rigorous way of predicting the behavior of strategic agents
        in situations of conflict. But the credibility of the Nash equilibrium as
        a framework for behavior-prediction depends on whether such equilibria are
        efficiently computable. After all, why should we expect a group of rational
        agents to behave in a fashion that requires exponential time to be computed?
        Motivated by this question, we study the computational complexity of the Nash
        equilibrium. \nWe show that computing a Nash equilibrium is an intractable
        problem. Since by Nash''s theorem a Nash equilibrium always exists, the problem
        belongs to the family of total search problems in NP, and previous work establishes
        that it is unlikely that such problems are NP-complete. We show instead that
        the problem is as hard as solving any Brouwer fixed point computation problem,
        in a precise complexity-theoretic sense. The corresponding complexity class
        is called PPAD, for Polynomial Parity Argument in Directed graphs, and our
        precise result is that computing a Nash equilibrium is a PPAD-complete problem.
        \nIn view of this hardness result, we are motivated to study the complexity
        of computing approximate Nash equilibria, with arbitrarily close approximation.
        In this regard, we consider a very natural and important class of games, called
        anonymous games. These are games in which every player is oblivious to the
        identities of the other players; examples arise in auction settings, congestion
        games, and social interactions. We give a polynomial time approximation scheme

        in game theory known as \"the Folk Theorem\" suggests that finding Nash equilibria
        in repeated games should be easier than in one-shot games. In contrast, we
        show that the problem of finding any (approximate) Nash equilibrium for a
        three-player infinitely-repeated game is computationally intractable (even
        when all payoffs are in {-1,0,1}), unless all of PPAD can be solved in randomized
        polynomial time. This is done by showing that finding Nash equilibria of (k+1)-player
        infinitely-repeated games is as hard as finding Nash equilibria of k-player
        one-shot games, for which PPAD-hardness is known (Daskalakis, Goldberg and

        of strategies (a very broad and important class of games), extending the two-strategy
        result of Daskalakis and Papadimitriou 2007. The approximation guarantee follows
        from a probabilistic result of more general interest: The distribution of
        the sum of n independent unit vectors with values ranging over {e1,...,ek},
        where ei is the unit vector along dimension i of the k-dimensional Euclidean
        space, can be approximated by the distribution of the sum of another set of
        independent unit vectors whose probabilities of obtaining each value are multiples
        of 1/z for some integer z, and so that the variational distance of the two
        distributions is at most eps, where eps is bounded by an inverse polynomial
        in z and a function of k, but with no dependence on n. Our probabilistic result
        specifies the construction of a surprisingly sparse epsi-cover- under the
        total variation distance - of the set of distributions of sums of independent
        unit vectors, which is of interest on its own right.", "venue": "2008 49th

        illustrated tale of reason, insanity, love and truth recounts the story of
        Bertrand Russell''s life. Raised by his paternal grandparents, young Russell
        was never told the whereabouts of his parents. Driven by a desire for knowledge
        of his own history, he attempted to force the world to yield to his yearnings:
        for truth, clarity and resolve. As he grew older, and increasingly sophisticated
        as a philosopher and mathematician, Russell strove to create an objective
        language with which to describe the world - one free of the biases and slippages
        of the written word. At the same time, he began courting his first wife, teasing
        her with riddles and leaning on her during the darker days, when his quest
        was bogged down by paradoxes, frustrations and the ghosts of his family''s
        secrets. Ultimately, he found considerable success - but his career was stalled
        when he was outmatched by an intellectual rival: his young, strident, brilliantly
        original student, Ludwig Wittgenstein. An insightful and complexly layered
        narrative, Logicomix reveals both Russell''s inner struggle and the quest
        for the foundations of logic. Narration by an older, wiser Russell, as well
        as asides from the author himself, make sense of the story''s heady and powerful
        ideas. At its heart, Logicomix is a story about the conflict between pure
        reason and the persistent flaws of reality, a narrative populated by great
        and august thinkers, young lovers, ghosts and insanity.", "venue": "", "year":

        "The question of what role sex plays in evolution is still open despite decades
        of research. It has often been assumed that sex should facilitate the increase
        in fitness. Hence, the fact that it may break down highly favorable genetic
        combinations has been seen as a problem. Here, we consider an alternative
        approach. We define a measure that represents the ability of alleles to perform
        well across different combinations and, using numerical iterations within
        a classical population-genetic framework, show that selection in the presence
        of sex favors this ability in a highly robust manner. We also show that the
        mechanism responsible for this effect has been out of the purview of previous
        theory, because it operates during the evolutionary transient, and that the
        breaking down of favorable genetic combinations is an integral part of it.
        Implications of these results and more to evolutionary theory are discussed.",

        "title": "Complexity of game dynamics", "abstract": "What happens when independent
        agents interact based on their selfish interests? Game theory''s earliest
        and most natural simple model of such interaction is the best-response Nash
        dynamics, the process of agents making unilateral moves that are their best
        response to the actions of others. Pure Nash equilibria, when they do exist,
        arise naturally as the steady states of this process. When they don''t exist,
        behavioral predictions can be made from \"sink equilibria\", a universal (guaranteed
        to exist) generalization of Nash equilibria to \"steady clusters of states.\"
        \nWe now know that it is vital for a model of naturally-occuring behavior
        to be computationally tractable, not only for simulations, but also to check
        how realistic the model is, since we expect that nature (aside maybe from
        quantum physics) cannot produce systems with fundamentally more computational
        power than computers as we know them. \nIn this dissertation, I show several
        results about the tractability of analyzing a game''s best-response dynamics.
        If the game payoff tables are given explicitly (in normal form), searching
        for pure Nash or sink equilibria is trivial. However, most interesting games
        are represented more succinctly. For pure Nash equilibria, I show that in
        potential games, a well-studied class of succinct games guaranteed to have
        pure equilibria, finding pure Nash equilibria is PLS-complete, and the best-response
        dynamics takes an exponentially long time to converge in the worst case, even
        when the games are restricted to network routing games, or to symmetric games.
        For sink equilbria, I prove that it is PSPACE-complete to analyze them in
        graphical games. \nOn the practical side, I resolve a decade-old well-known
        open problem in networking by establishing that it is PSPACE-complete to predict
        whether Internet inter-domain routing may be destabilized by large-scale oscillations;
        that is, whether a system of path preferences in the BGP protocol may lead
        to flapping. This turns out to be a question about the best-response dynamics
        in a special kind of game. \nLastly, I propose several enhanced equilibrium
        concepts inspired by game dynamics that allow for higher rationality by the
        players while mostly retaining the tractability and universality of sink equilibria
        in normal-form games.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 59, "citationCount":

        review the complexity and approximability of different variants of interval
        scheduling problems. Next, we motivate the relevance of interval scheduling
        problems by providing an overview of applications that have appeared in literature.
        Finally, we focus on algorithmic results for two important variants of interval
        scheduling problems. In one variant we deal with nonidentical machines: instead
        of each machine being continuously available, there is a given interval for
        each machine in which it is available. In another variant, the machines are
        continuously available but they are ordered, and each job has a given \u201cmaximal\u201d
        machine on which it can be processed. We investigate the complexity of these

        "abstract": "We address the problem of balancing the traffic load in multi-hop
        wireless networks. We consider a point-to-point communicating network with
        a uniform distribution of source-sink pairs. When routing along shortest paths,
        the nodes that are centrally located forward a disproportionate amount of
        traffic. This translates into increased congestion and energy consumption.
        However, the maximum load can be decreased if the packets follow curved paths.
        We show that the optimum such routing scheme can be expressed in terms of
        geometric optics and computed by linear programming. We then propose a practical
        solution, which we call Curveball Routing which achieves results not much
        worse than the optimum.\n We evaluate our solution at three levels of fidelity:
        a Java high-level simulator, the ns2 simulator, and the Intel Mirage Sensor
        Network Testbed. Simulation results using the high-level simulator show that
        our solution successfully avoids the crowded center of the network, and reduces
        the maximum load by up to 40%. At the same time, the increase of the expected
        path length is minimal, i.e., only 8% on average. Simulation results using
        the ns2 simulator show that our solution can increase throughput on moderately
        loaded networks by up to 15%, while testbed results show a reduction in peak
        energy usage by up to 25%. Our prototype suggests that our solution is easily
        deployable.", "venue": "ACM Interational Symposium on Mobile Ad Hoc Networking

        "title": "On Extroverted Complexity Theory", "abstract": "Complexity theory
        has come a long way in the thirty years since its inception. It has identiied
        some of the most fundamental and deep problems related to computation, it
        has developed a powerful methodology for attacking them, and it is broadly
        considered as one of the most challenging mathematical frontiers. Considered
        as a pure mathematical discipline in the pursuit of mathematical insight and
        depth, complexity is successful and well-established. In this note, however,
        I would like to concentrate on complexity as an applied mathematical discipline
        whose function is to gain insights into the problems of the natural, social,
        and applied and engineering sciences. This aspect has been somewhat peripheral
        to what we usually mean by \\complexity theory,\" but I believe it is important
        for its future. Understanding the position of complexity theory within the
        realm of scien-tiic inquiry is an important project which is, of course, well
        beyond the scope of this note; here I shall only refer anecdotally to six
        distinct ways in which complexity theory has reached out and touch other elds:
        Complexity as NP-completeness. One of the major achievements of complexity
        theory is the living connection it has forged between application problems
        and modes of resource-bounded computation. This is typically done through
        the key notion of completeness, of which NP-completeness is of course the
        most popular kind. Completeness comes so natural to a complexity theorist,
        that it is easy to forget what an important and innuential concept it has
        been. In fact, outside theoretical computer science, \\complexity theory\"
        is often understood |unjustly, to be sure| as synonymous to \\NP-completeness.\"
        2 Complexity as mathematical poverty. One of the fundamental theses that seems
        to be almost universally accepted and practiced in computer science is that
        algorithms |and eecient algorithms in particular| are the natural outtow of
        mathematical structure discovered in applications. 3 If we accept this implication
        , then we must also espouse the contrapositive one, namely, that complexity
        is the manifestation of mathematical nastiness. Complexity has been often
        and brilliantly used within computer science and mathematics in this allegorical
        way; a computational problem is formulated and proved hard for the sole purpose
        of pointing out the mathematical diiculties involved in an area or approach
        (see 6] for an early example from database theory). Adapted from the introduction
        of 8] 2 Among treatments of complexity theory by scientists outside our eld
        this is one is not the most ignorantly \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2007,

        considerations underlie recent work on random Boolean satisfiability. We study
        connectivity properties of the space of solutions of Boolean formulas, and
        establish computational and structural dichotomies. Specifically, we first
        establish a dichotomy theorem for the complexity of the st-connectivity problem

        tractable side is more generous than the tractable side in Schaefer''s dichotomy
        theorem for satisfiability, while the intractable side is PSPACE-complete.
        For the connectivity problem, we establish a dichotomy along the same boundary
        between membership in coNP and PSPACE-completeness. Furthermore, we establish
        a structural dichotomy theorem for the diameter of the connected components
        of the solution space: for the PSPACE-complete cases, the diameter can be
        exponential, but in all other cases it is linear. Thus, small diameter and

        "title": "Geometric embeddings, geometric algorithms, and combinatorial optimization",
        "abstract": "Geometric spaces arise in computer science through a number of
        avenues. The most obvious of these occurs when the input data for our problem
        possesses an inherent geometric structure, e.g. the hop-distance between nodes
        in a network, or the similarity distance between two genomic sequences. Certainly
        these \"geometries\" may be far afield from the classical setting where one
        is concerned, for instance, with Euclidean spaces or Riemannian manifolds,
        and thus we require new techniques for the design of efficient algorithms
        on these spaces, and new models for the kind of geometries we should expect.
        \nOn the other hand, geometry often presents itself in a less straightforward
        manner in the setting of combinatorial optimization. A classical example of
        this is the use of Linear Programming in the solution---exact or approximate---to
        a variety of combinatorial problems. The most exciting connections occur when
        a problem with an a priori purely combinatorial structure is shown to involve
        rich geometric phenomena. \nThe present thesis is divided into two parts which
        address questions of both types (i.e. combinatorial data and geometric data,
        respectively), leading to new algorithms for a variety of well-known combinatorial
        problems, new connections between geometry and computer science, and new geometric
        and analytic information about some classical mathematical objects. \nIn Part
        I, we employ geometric embeddings in order to provide near-optimal solutions
        to a number of NP-hard optimization problems. Given a combinatorial object,
        e.g. a graph, we develop new ways of embedding the object into a geometric
        space in a way which approximately preserves its structure. We then use geometric
        tools to produce a solution to the original optimization problem whose quality
        is within some (ideally small) factor of the optimal solution. This approach
        is most fruitful when applied to graph separator-type problems where the goal
        is to divide a graph into two large pieces while minimizing the size of the
        \"interface\" between them. Algorithms for such tasks are then used as primitives
        in divide-and-conquer approaches to a number of other optimization problems.
        \nIn Part II, we examine the relationship between dimension, volume growth,
        and algorithmic tractability. The so-called curse of dimensionality is well-known;
        in many settings, the difficulty of solving a geometric problem increases
        exponentially with the dimension of the input. We study notions of the intrinsic
        dimension of a data set, and show that in many cases, very efficient algorithms
        and data structures can be designed for high-dimensional data which is nevertheless
        \"low-dimensional\" from an intrinsic viewpoint.", "venue": "", "year": 2006,

        tutoring program and namesake (or virtual emanation?) of Alan Turing, World
        War II code breaker and father of computer science. In this unusual novel,
        Turing''s idiosyncratic version of intellectual history from a computational
        point of view unfolds in tandem with the story of a love affair involving
        Ethel, a successful computer executive, Alexandros, a melancholy archaeologist,
        and Ian, a charismatic hacker. After Ethel (who shares her first name with
        Alan Turing''s mother) abandons Alexandros following a sundrenched idyll on
        Corfu, Turing appears on Alexandros''s computer screen to unfurl a tutorial
        on the history of ideas. He begins with the philosopher-mathematicians of
        ancient Greece -- \"discourse, dialogue, argument, proof... can only thrive
        in an egalitarian society\" -- and the Arab scholar in ninth-century Baghdad
        who invented algorithms; he moves on to many other topics, including cryptography
        and artificial intelligence, even economics and developmental biology. (These
        lessons are later critiqued amusingly and developed further in postings by
        a fictional newsgroup in the book''s afterword.) As Turing''s lectures progress,
        the lives of Alexandros, Ethel, and Ian converge in dramatic fashion, and
        the story takes us from Corfu to Hong Kong, from Athens to San Francisco --
        and of course to the Internet, the disruptive technological and social force
        that emerges as the main locale and protagonist of the novel.Alternately pedagogical
        and romantic, Turing (A Novel about Computation) should appeal both to students

        an interactive tutoring program and namesake (or virtual emanation?) of Alan
        Turing, World War II code breaker and father of computer science. In this
        unusual novel, Turing''s idiosyncratic version of intellectual history from
        a computational point of view unfolds in tandem with the story of a love affair
        involving Ethel, a successful computer executive, Alexandros, a melancholy
        archaeologist, and Ian, a charismatic hacker. After Ethel (who shares her
        first name with Alan Turing''s mother) abandons Alexandros following a sundrenched
        idyll on Corfu, Turing appears on Alexandros''s computer screen to unfurl
        a tutorial on the history of ideas. He begins with the philosopher-mathematicians
        of ancient Greece -- \"discourse, dialogue, argument, proof... can only thrive
        in an egalitarian society\" -- and the Arab scholar in ninth-century Baghdad
        who invented algorithms; he moves on to many other topics, including cryptography
        and artificial intelligence, even economics and developmental biology. (These
        lessons are later critiqued amusingly and developed further in postings by
        a fictional newsgroup in the book''s afterword.) As Turing''s lectures progress,
        the lives of Alexandros, Ethel, and Ian converge in dramatic fashion, and
        the story takes us from Corfu to Hong Kong, from Athens to San Francisco --
        and of course to the Internet, the disruptive technological and social force
        that emerges as the main locale and protagonist of the novel.Alternately pedagogical
        and romantic, Turing (A Novel about Computation) should appeal both to students
        and professionals who want a clear and entertaining account of the development
        of computation and to the general reader who enjoys novels of ideas.", "venue":

        "title": "Revenue maximization in online auctions", "abstract": "In the modern
        information economy, markets are proliferating, and in such an environment,
        automated market mechanisms, such as auctions, are becoming more important
        than ever. Economists have long studied the problem of maximizing the revenue
        obtained by the seller from an auction. In this dissertation, we study the
        same problem, but from the computer scientist''s perspective: where the economist
        generally assumes that inputs are independently drawn from a preexisting population,
        we take the assumption that inputs are controlled by an adversary. At the
        same time, we adopt the economist''s assumption that inputs are held as private
        information by individuals, who will only reveal information when it is in
        their best interest to do so. \nIn this model, we study auctions with a novel
        combination of two properties. First, we assume that the seller has available
        an unlimited supply of the good to be sold, as would be the case in auctions
        for digital goods such as music or movies. Second, we assume that the auction
        is online, in the sense that it proceeds over time, with the seller forced
        to make a sequence of decisions, each based only on information received up
        to that point. \nIn analyzing the revenue properties of such auctions, we
        show a connection between this problem and that of online learning with expert
        advice. We demonstrate how to use learning algorithms to design auctions that
        are asymptotically optimal. In this context, we focus on learning algorithms
        that use polynomial weight functions to adapt to new information. We show
        how such algorithms can have a useful combination of worst-case and average-case
        properties, suggesting that they might be used in place of more commonly studied
        algorithms based on exponential weight functions. Finally, we extend our results
        to the study of posted price mechanisms, in which buyers react to dynamically
        adjusted posted prices, rather than submitting bids to the seller.", "venue":

        "title": "Turing''s Test", "abstract": "Our hero is Turing, an interactive
        tutoring program and namesake (or virtual emanation?) of Alan Turing, World
        War II code breaker and father of computer science. In this unusual novel,
        Turing''s idiosyncratic version of intellectual history from a computational
        point of view unfolds in tandem with the story of a love affair involving
        Ethel, a successful computer executive, Alexandros, a melancholy archaeologist,
        and Ian, a charismatic hacker. After Ethel (who shares her first name with
        Alan Turing''s mother) abandons Alexandros following a sundrenched idyll on
        Corfu, Turing appears on Alexandros''s computer screen to unfurl a tutorial
        on the history of ideas. He begins with the philosopher-mathematicians of
        ancient Greece -- \"discourse, dialogue, argument, proof... can only thrive
        in an egalitarian society\" -- and the Arab scholar in ninth-century Baghdad
        who invented algorithms; he moves on to many other topics, including cryptography
        and artificial intelligence, even economics and developmental biology. (These
        lessons are later critiqued amusingly and developed further in postings by
        a fictional newsgroup in the book''s afterword.) As Turing''s lectures progress,
        the lives of Alexandros, Ethel, and Ian converge in dramatic fashion, and
        the story takes us from Corfu to Hong Kong, from Athens to San Francisco --
        and of course to the Internet, the disruptive technological and social force
        that emerges as the main locale and protagonist of the novel.Alternately pedagogical
        and romantic, Turing (A Novel about Computation) should appeal both to students
        and professionals who want a clear and entertaining account of the development
        of computation and to the general reader who enjoys novels of ideas.", "venue":

        and experimental analysis of a simple abstract model of www creation and search

        higher when the utilities are more clustered, and that power-law statistics
        of document degrees emerge very naturally in this context. More importantly,
        our work sets up many more elaborate questions, related, e.g., to www search

        selfishly, using a game-theoretic approach. We refer to this as the selfish
        caching problem. In our model, nodes incur either cost for replicating resources
        or cost for access to a remote replica. We show the existence of pure strategy
        Nash equilibria and investigate the price of anarchy, which is the relative
        cost of the lack of coordination. The price of anarchy can be high due to
        undersupply problems, but with certain network topologies it has better bounds.
        With a payment scheme the game can always implement the social optimum in
        the best case by giving servers incentive to replicate.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS

        "We devise a model to study the phenomenon of free-riding and free-identities
        in peer-to-peer systems. At the heart of our model is a user of a certain
        type, an intrinsic and private parameter that reflects the user''s willingness
        to contribute resources to the system. A user decides whether to contribute
        or free-ride based on how the current contribution cost in the system compares
        to her type. We study the impact of mechanisms that exclude low type users
        or, more realistically, penalize free-riders with degraded service. We also
        consider dynamic scenarios with arrivals and departures of users, and with
        whitewashers -users who leave the system and rejoin with new identities to
        avoid reputational penalties. We find that imposing penalty on all users that
        join the system is effective under many scenarios. In particular, system performance
        degrades significantly only when the turnover rate among users is high. Finally,
        we show that the optimal exclusion or penalty level differs significantly
        from the level that optimizes the performance of contributors only for a limited
        range of societal generosity levels.", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Selected

        an interactive tutoring program and namesake (or virtual emanation?) of Alan
        Turing, World War II code breaker and father of computer science. In this
        unusual novel, Turing''s idiosyncratic version of intellectual history from
        a computational point of view unfolds in tandem with the story of a love affair
        involving Ethel, a successful computer executive, Alexandros, a melancholy
        archaeologist, and Ian, a charismatic hacker. After Ethel (who shares her
        first name with Alan Turing''s mother) abandons Alexandros following a sundrenched
        idyll on Corfu, Turing appears on Alexandros''s computer screen to unfurl
        a tutorial on the history of ideas. He begins with the philosopher-mathematicians
        of ancient Greece--\"discourse, dialogue, argument, proof...can only thrive
        in an egalitarian society\"--and the Arab scholar in ninth-century Baghdad
        who invented algorithms; he moves on to many other topics, including cryptography
        and artificial intelligence, even economics and developmental biology. (These
        lessons are later critiqued amusingly and developed further in postings by
        a fictional newsgroup in the book''s afterword.) As Turing''s lectures progress,
        the lives of Alexandros, Ethel, and Ian converge in dramatic fashion, and
        the story takes us from Corfu to Hong Kong, from Athens to San Francisco--and
        of course to the Internet, the disruptive technological and social force that
        emerges as the main locale and protagonist of the novel. Alternately pedagogical
        and romantic, Turing (A Novel about Computation) should appeal both to students
        and professionals who want a clear and entertaining account of the development
        of computation and to the general reader who enjoys novels of ideas.", "venue":

        "title": "An approximate truthful mechanism for combinatorial auctions with
        single parameter agents", "abstract": "Mechanism design seeks algorithms whose
        inputs are provided by selfish agents who would lie if advantageous. Incentive
        compatible mechanisms compel the agents to tell the truth by making it in
        their self-interest to do so. Often, as in combinatorial auctions, such mechanisms
        involve the solution of NP-hard problems. Unfortunately, approximation algorithms
        typically destroy incentive compatibility. Randomized rounding is a commonly
        used technique for designing approximation algorithms. We devise a version
        of randomized rounding that is incentive compatible, giving a truthful mechanism
        for combinatorial auctions with single parameter agents (e.g., \"single minded
        bidders\") that approximately maximizes the social value of the auction. We
        discuss two orthogonal notions of truthfulness for a randomized mechanism,
        truthfulness with high probability and in expectation, and give a mechanism
        that achieves both simultaneously.We consider combinatorial auctions where
        multiple copies of many different items are on sale, and each bidder i desires
        a subset Si. Given a set of bids, the problem of finding the allocation of
        items that maximizes total valuation is the well-known SETPACKING problem.
        This problem is NP-hard, but for the case of items with many identical copies
        the optimum can be approximated very well. To turn this approximation algorithm
        into a truthful auction mechanism we overcome two problems: we show how to
        make the allocation algorithm monotone, and give a method to compute the appropriate
        payments efficiently.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms",

        massive data sets, ranging from flows of Internet traffic to logs of supermarket
        transactions, have emerged during the past few years. Their overwhelming size
        and the typically restricted access to them call for new computational models.
        This thesis studies three such models: sampling computations, data stream
        computations, and sketch computations. \nWhile most of the previous work focused
        on designing algorithms in the new models, this thesis revolves around the
        limitations of the models. We develop a suite of lower bound techniques that
        characterize the complexity of functions in these models, indicating which
        problems can be solved efficiently in them. We derive specific bounds for
        a multitude of practical problems, arising from applications in database,
        networking, and information retrieval, such as frequency statistics, selection
        functions, statistical moments, and distance estimation. \nWe present general,
        powerful, and easy to use lower bound techniques for the sampling model. The
        techniques apply to all functions and address both oblivious and adaptive
        sampling. They frequently produce optimal bounds for a wide range of functions.
        They are stated in terms of new combinatorial and statistical properties of
        functions, which are easy to calculate. \nWe obtain lower bounds for the data
        stream and sketch models through one-way and simultaneous communication complexity.
        We develop lower bounds for the latter via a new information-theoretic view
        of communication complexity. A highlight of this work is an optimal simultaneous
        communication complexity lower bound for the important multi-party set-disjointness
        problem. \nFinally, we present a powerful method for proving lower bounds
        for general communication complexity. The method is based on a direct sum
        property of a new measure of complexity for communication complexity protocols
        and on a novel statistical view of communication complexity. We use the technique
        to obtain improved communication complexity and data stream lower bounds for
        several problems, including multi-party set-disjointness, frequency moments,
        and Lp distance estimation. These results solve open problems of Alon, Matias,

        "title": "Selfish behavior and stability of the internet:: a game-theoretic
        analysis of TCP", "abstract": "For years, the conventional wisdom [7, 22]
        has been that the continued stability of the Internet depends on the widespread
        deployment of \"socially responsible\" congestion control. In this paper,
        we seek to answer the following fundamental question: If network end-points
        behaved in a selfish manner, would the stability of the Internet be endangered?.We
        evaluate the impact of greedy end-point behavior through a game-theoretic
        analysis of TCP. In this \"TCP Game\" each flowattempts to maximize the throughput
        it achieves by modifying its congestion control behavior. We use a combination
        of analysis and simulation to determine the Nash Equilibrium of this game.
        Our question then reduces to whether the network operates efficiently at these
        Nash equilibria.Our findings are twofold. First, in more traditional environments
        -- where end-points use TCP Reno-style loss recovery and routers use drop-tail
        queues -- the Nash Equilibria are reasonably efficient. However, when endpoints
        use more recent variations of TCP (e.g., SACK) and routers employ either RED
        or drop-tail queues, the Nash equilibria are very inefficient. This suggests
        that the Internet of the past could remain stable in the face of greedy end-user
        behavior, but the Internet of today is vulnerable to such behavior. Second,
        we find that restoring the efficiency of the Nash equilibria in these settings
        does not require heavy-weight packet scheduling techniques (e.g., Fair Queuing)
        but instead can be done with a very simple stateless mechanism based on CHOKe
        [21].", "venue": "Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures,

        "title": "Communities and reputation on the web", "abstract": "Search engines
        play a valuable social role by increasing the visibility of information on
        the world wide web. While their retrieval performance is impressive, little
        work has been done to support other social needs, such as evaluating the reputation
        of information. The goal of this work is to enable search systems to use the
        social context, of a particular community, to assess the reputation of web
        pages. \nWe shall start by assuming that we can do textual retrieval well:
        in particular, that we can perform broad-topic queries which return large
        sets of pages. A community is defined by the pages in such a set. We argue,
        based on considerations of the nature of human activity, that it is reasonable
        for algorithms to focus on the hyperlinks between pages in the community,
        in order to assess reputation. \nWe demonstrate that a good candidate for
        doing such link analysis is the HITS algorithm. However, this has problems
        of slow execution, instability of results, and an issue known as topic drift:
        when analysing link structures, pages in \u201cnearby\u201d communities sometimes
        garner overly high scores. \nTo improve execution speed, we show that we can
        define a measure of centrality in a vector space, which generalises the HITS
        model and makes it analogous to Latent Semantic Analysis, a powerful text
        analysis technique. The Generalised HITS algorithm precomputes global summary
        vectors and uses them to perform local reputation calculations quickly. \nTo
        tackle both instability and topic drift, we introduce a tunable parameter
        which reduces the influence of nearby communities, without losing the benefits
        of the HITS algorithm. The calculation is efficient enough to allow us to
        control this effect interactively. \nUsing controlled experiments, we verify
        that our techniques succeed on realistic simulations of the web, which match
        observed properties such as the \u201cpower-law\u201d linkage structure. We
        also consider the real linkage structures created by webloggers, and show
        that we have the same ability to judge reputation. \nThese techniques enable
        us to integrate the presentation of reputation judgements into web-scale search
        systems, in a way which is justifiably meaningful, accommodating of realistic
        web phenomena, and community specific.", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount":

        of theoreticians, thier achievements, and thier unique style, drawing to a
        large extent on examples from this volume.Theoretical Computer Science has
        largely succeeded in its core mission, that is, improving a rigorous and productive
        foundational understanding of the power and limitations of the von Neumann
        computer and its software. And in the past few years it has strived to extend
        its reach to the Internet and the worldwide web, the central computational
        artifact of our times.But theoreticians have achieved much more than this.
        Our community has identified P vs. NP, arguably the deepest and most important
        mathematical question of our time -- and it is leading the assault on it.
        In addition we are developing \"algorithmic mirrors\" through which other
        sciences (notably Physics and Biology, with Economics and other Social Sciences
        soon to join) rediscover, fruitfully, themselves. And we have furthered and
        influenced crucially Combinatorics and Logic, the important mathematical fields
        from which we have drawn methodologically. The newfound respectability and
        prestige of our parent field, Computer Science, owes much to these achievements.Theoreticians
        comprise a microcosm with wonderful characteristics: Great scientific, social,
        and intellectual openness; responsibility and mutual respect, but also healthy
        doses of irreverence, mistrust of the establishment, willingness to experiment,
        and self-critical spirit; and a strong sense of an international community
        that is remarkably cohesive and tightly knit while celebrating the diversity
        of its people, of their backgrounds, and of their scientific interests and
        approaches.We have also developed a fascinating, complex esthetic of our work
        based on mathematical elegance and depth, relevance and fashion, timeliness
        and competition -- but also on playfulness and humor. Our esthetic has served
        us well: Some of our most important results were derived by long chains of
        contributions, each seemingly guided to a large extent by such esthetic considerations.
        In fact, this esthetic extends delightfully to the exposition of our work,
        as evidenced by the unique genre of scientific prose known as \"FOCS/STOC
        abstract\".", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of Computing", "year": 2002,

        "title": "Selfish behavior and stability of the internet: a game-theoretic
        analysis of TCP", "abstract": "For years, the conventional wisdom [7, 22]
        has been that the continued stability of the Internet depends on the widespread
        deployment of \"socially responsible\" congestion control. In this paper,
        we seek to answer the following fundamental question: If network end-points
        behaved in a selfish manner, would the stability of the Internet be endangered?.We
        evaluate the impact of greedy end-point behavior through a game-theoretic
        analysis of TCP. In this \"TCP Game\" each flowattempts to maximize the throughput
        it achieves by modifying its congestion control behavior. We use a combination
        of analysis and simulation to determine the Nash Equilibrium of this game.
        Our question then reduces to whether the network operates efficiently at these
        Nash equilibria.Our findings are twofold. First, in more traditional environments
        -- where end-points use TCP Reno-style loss recovery and routers use drop-tail
        queues -- the Nash Equilibria are reasonably efficient. However, when endpoints
        use more recent variations of TCP (e.g., SACK) and routers employ either RED
        or drop-tail queues, the Nash equilibria are very inefficient. This suggests
        that the Internet of the past could remain stable in the face of greedy end-user
        behavior, but the Internet of today is vulnerable to such behavior. Second,
        we find that restoring the efficiency of the Nash equilibria in these settings
        does not require heavy-weight packet scheduling techniques (e.g., Fair Queuing)
        but instead can be done with a very simple stateless mechanism based on CHOKe

        interests, in various degrees of collaboration and competition with each other.

        attaining an algorithmic and conceptual understanding of the Internet must
        include some kind of fusion between mathematical economics (especially game
        theory and its inverse problem, mechanism design) and algorithmic thinking.

        of queries in distributed database systems is known to be subject to delicate
        trade-offs. For example, the Mariposa database system allows users to specify
        a desired delay-cost tradeoff (that is, to supply a decreasing function u(d),
        specifying how much the user is willing to pay in order to receive the query
        results within time d); Mariposa divides a query graph into horizontal \u201cstrides,\u201d
        analyzes each stride, and uses a greedy heuristic to find the \u201cbest\u201d
        plan for all strides. We show that Mariposa''s greedy heuristic can be arbitrarily
        far from the desired optimum. Applying a recent approach in multiobjective
        optimization algorithms to this problem, we show that the optimum cost-delay
        trade-off (Pareto) curve in Mariposa''s framework can be approximated fast
        within any desired accuracy. We also present a polynomial algorithm for the
        general multiobjective query optimization problem, which approximates arbirarily

        "title": "Algorithmic aspects of protein folding and protein structure similarity",
        "abstract": "In this dissertation, we study two important computational biological
        problems inspired by the structures of proteins. The first is the protein
        folding problem. The object of this problem is to determine a protein''s structure
        given its linear amino acid sequence. We consider a widely-accepted model
        of protein folding, the two-dimensional hydrophobichydrophilic model, which
        was formulated by Dill in 1990. This model abstracts what is thought to be
        the dominant force in protein folding, that hydrophobic amino acids tend to
        cluster together in order to avoid exposure to water, and the protein is modelled
        as a two-dimensional self-avoiding walk in the square lattice. This model
        was proposed as an ultimate simplification of protein folding. We answer the
        open question of the protein folding problem''s tractability in this model
        by proving it is NP-hard. \nThe second problem, protein structure similarity,
        focuses on determining a measure of the similarity of two protein structures.
        We consider the contact map overlap measure, which was formulated by Godzik,
        Skolnick, and Kolinski in 1993. This measure involves finding an order-preserving
        mapping between subsets of the protein amino acid sets so that the largest
        possible number of nearby amino acid pairs, or contacts, is preserved. The
        study of contact maps, graphs whose edges capture these nearby amino acid
        pairs, is interesting in itself. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for
        computing the contact map overlap of special classes of contact maps, including
        stacks and two new classes called staircases and augmented staircases. Using
        these algorithms, we derive a 2-approximation algorithm for computing the
        contact overlap of any two RNA structures. We study contact maps using a self-avoiding
        walk in the two-dimensional square lattice as a protein model. We prove structural
        theorems establishing that the contact maps induced by self-avoiding walks
        can be decomposed into two stacks and one queue, or two augmented staircases
        and one stack. As a corollary to these theorems, we derive a 3-approximation
        algorithm for computing the contact map overlap of walks. Finally, we prove
        that computing contact overlap is NP-complete, even when the contact maps
        are induced by self-avoiding walks. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
        study of protein structure similarity.", "venue": "", "year": 2000, "referenceCount":

        to a combinatorial optimization problem are evaluated with respect to several
        cost criteria, and we are interested in the trade-off between these objectives
        (the so-called Pareto curve). We point out that, under very general conditions,
        there is a polynomially succinct curve that /spl epsiv/-approximates the Pareto
        curve, for any /spl epsiv/>0. We give a necessary and sufficient condition
        under which this approximate Pareto curve can be constructed in time polynomial
        in the size of the instance and 1//spl epsiv/. In the case of multiple linear
        objectives, we distinguish between two cases: when the underlying feasible
        region is convex, then we show that approximating the multi-objective problem
        is equivalent to approximating the single-objective problem. If however the
        feasible region is discrete, then we point out that the question reduces to
        an old and recurrent one: how does the complexity of a combinatorial optimization
        problem change when its feasible region is intersected with a hyperplane with
        small coefficients; we report some interesting new findings in this domain.

        beam is initially uniformly doped with phosphorous to a concentration ND =
        1 \u00d7 10cm. Suppose you want to make the beam more conductive by diffusing
        boron atoms into the n-type polysilicon material. To do so, you first place
        the wafer into a predeposition furnace alongside solid-source boron wafers
        for 30min at 1000C. You then cap the film with an undoped oxide and drive
        in the dopants (with no boron source) for 60min at the same temperature. [Assume
        for this problem that the diffusion coefficient Do of polysilicon is 10 times
        larger than that of single crystal silicon (SCS). Also, assume that the solid-solubility
        limit and electrically active concentration limits, as well as carrier mobility
        of polysilicon, are the same as SCS. Some of this is not entirely true, but
        it makes the problem more tractable.]", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount":

        to uniform circuits of polynomial depth and exponential size. This provides
        an alternative, logic based formulation of the uniform circuit model, which
        may be more convenient for problems naturally formulated in logic terms, and
        establishes that reflection allows for more \u201cintense\u201d parallelism,
        which is not attainable otherwise (unless P=PSPACE). We also explore the power

        to verify the map, if we had it in the beginning. The situation is complicated
        by the fact that the latter off-line problem (the problem of optimally verifying
        a map) is NP-hard. Although we show that there is no such \u201ccompetitive\u201d
        algorithm for general obstacle courses, we give a competitive algorithm for
        the case of a polygonal room with a bounded number of obstacles in it. We
        restrict ourselves to the rectilinear case, where each side of the obstacles
        and the room is parallel to one of the coordinates, and the robot must also
        move either parallel or perpendicular to the sides. (In a subsequent paper,
        we will discuss the extension to polygons of general shapes.)\nWe also discuss
        the off-line problem for simple rectilinear polygons and find an optimal solution
        (in the L1 metric) in polynomial time, in the case where the entry and the
        exit are different points.", "venue": "JACM", "year": 1998, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge", "abstract": "Approximating
        a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope
        and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996)
        as a form of \"knowledge compilation,\" supporting rapid approximate reasoning;
        on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates,
        and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou
        and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed
        in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic
        impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob
        (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally,
        these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update
        any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn
        structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation,
        which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is
        inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents.
        A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation.
        To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change
        update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key
        fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to
        compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update
        of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are
        possible for more complex updates.", "venue": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence

        "title": "Maximizing throughput of reliable bulk network transmissions", "abstract":
        "We study combinatorial optimization and on-line scheduling problems which
        arise in the context of supporting applications which transmit bulk data over
        high-speed networks. One of our primary objectives in this thesis work is
        to formulate appropriate theoretical models in which to develop and analyze
        efficient algorithms for these problems--models which reflect both the experience
        of network architects, the design of network protocols, and contributions
        of theoretical research. \nWe first consider the optimization problem of maximizing
        the utilization of a shared resource, network bandwidth, across a set of point-to-point
        connections. A feasible solution to this allocation problem is an assignment
        of transmission rates to the connections which does not violate the capacity
        constraints of the network links. The connections and routers which are responsible
        for establishing this allocation must do so with incomplete information and
        limited communication capabilities. We develop a theoretical model which addresses
        these considerations and study the tradeoff between the quality of the solution
        we can obtain and the distributed running time. Our main theoretical result
        is a distributed algorithm for this problem which generates a feasible $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation
        to the optimal allocation in a polylogarithmic number of distributed rounds.
        A sequential implementation of our distributed algorithm gives a simple, efficient
        approximation algorithm for general positive linear programming. Subsequent
        experience with an implementation of the algorithm indicates that it is well
        suited to future deployment in high-speed networks. \nThe next problem we
        consider is the following on-line scheduling problem, which the sender of
        a point-to-point bulk transmission must address: Given an on-line sequence
        of transmission times, determine which data item to transmit at each transmission
        time, so as to maximize effective throughput to the receiver at all points
        in time. For this application, we measure effective throughput as the length
        of the intact prefix of the message at the receiver. This problem is made
        difficult in practice by factors beyond the sender''s control, such as packet
        loss and wide variance in packet round-trip times. Using the method of competitive
        analysis, we compare the performance of our algorithm to that of an omniscient
        algorithm. We prove that while all deterministic policies perform poorly in
        this model, a simple randomized policy delivers near-optimal performance at
        any given point in time with high probability. Moreover, our theoretical result
        ensures that typical performance does not degrade significantly--a claim which
        our empirical studies bear out. \nUsing the models and tools developed for
        these problems, we then consider analogous problems which arise for multicast
        bulk transmissions, transmissions targeted to multiple destinations. We show
        how to tune our bandwidth allocation policy to still deliver a $(1+\\epsilon)$
        approximation to the optimal allocation in a polylogarithmic number of distributed
        rounds. For the scheduling problem, we prove that no on-line scheduling policy
        can deliver high performance which scales with the number of receivers without
        using encoding. We then show that by using forward error correction coding
        techniques, a simple multicast policy delivers effective throughput within
        a constant factor of optimal independent of the number of receivers.", "venue":

        "The principles underlying this report can be summarized as follows:1. A strong
        theoretical foundation is vital to computer science.2. Theory can be enriched
        by practice.3. Practice can be enriched by theory.4. If we are guided by (2)
        and (3), the value, impact, and funding of theory will be enhanced.In order
        to achieve a greater synergy between theory and application, and to sustain
        and expand on the remarkable successes of Theory of Computing (TOC), we consider
        it essential to increase the impact of theory on key application areas. This
        requires additional financial resources in support of theory, and closer interaction
        between theoreticians and researchers in other areas of computer science and
        in other disciplines.The report does not make a detailed assessment of the
        overall state of theoretical computer science or fully chronicle the achievements
        of this field. Instead, it has the specific objective of recommending ways
        to harness these remarkable achievements for the solution of challenging problems
        emerging from new developments such as the information superhighway.Section
        1 describes the events leading up to this report and delineates the report''s
        objectives. Section 2 establishes the context for the report. It traces the
        history of TOC, describes the impact that TOC has achieved in the areas of
        core theory and fundamental algorithms, points out the differences between
        these areas and application-oriented theory, and calls for an intensified
        effort to bring the methods of TOC to bear on applications. It then goes on
        to define the four main categories into which our recommen- dations fall:
        building bridges between theory and applications, algorithm engineering, communication,
        and education. Section 3 discusses some specific opportunities for stimulating
        interactions between TOC and applied areas. Section 4 proposes an applied
        research initiative, Information Access in a Globally Distributed Environment,
        which identifies an exciting current technological area that we believe presents
        challenging opportunities for excellent theoretical work. Section 5 proposes
        a second applied research initiative, The Algorithmic Stockroom, that would
        exploit and extend the body of theoretical knowledge in the field of algorithms.
        Section 6 proposes a broadening in graduate education with two purposes in
        mind: to better prepare theoreticians to interact creatively with practitioners,
        and to provide future practitioners with the background they will need to
        benefit from this exchange.", "venue": "Sigact News", "year": 1997, "referenceCount":

        "We revisit the issue of the complexity of database queries, in the light
        of the recent parametric refinement of complexity theory. We show that, if
        the query size (or the number of variables in the query) is considered as
        a parameter, then the relational calculus and its fragments (conjunctive queries,
        positive queries) are classified at appropriate levels of the so-called W
        hierarchy of Downey and Fellows. These results strongly suggest that the query
        size is inherently in the exponent of the data complexity of any query evaluation
        algorithm, with the implication becoming stronger as the expressibility of
        the query language increases. For recursive languages (fixpoint logic, Datalog)
        this is provably the case [14]. On the positive side, we show that this exponential
        dependence can be avoided for the extension of acyclic queries with # (but
        not <) inequalities.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles

        ultimate goal of Artificial Intelligence (to come up with a machine that is
        able to reason as humans do) is still a long term one; developing schemes
        for knowledge representation and common-sense reasoning are important and
        widely accepted tactical goals. This thesis is about the application of the
        methods of the theory of computational complexity in order to choose among
        the possible approaches towards an effective mathematical model of common
        sense. \nWe develop a methodology for comparing knowledge representation formalisms
        in terms of their \"representational succinctness,\" and use this framework
        for comparing many important formalisms for knowledge representation. We also
        show that adding new variables improves the effective expressibility of certain
        knowledge representation formalisms. \nApproximating a general formula from
        above and below by Horn formulas was proposed by Kautz and Selman as a form
        of \"knowledge compilation,\" supporting rapid approximate reasoning; as we
        point out, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain
        complexity drawbacks. In our work we propose a new, very efficient scheme,
        incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based
        updates. \nFinally, we look closer at two knowledge representation formalisms
        that have the same expressive power--Horn formulas and characteristic model--and
        try to tell which one is better to use for representing knowledge in various

        "title": "Topological queries in spatial databases", "abstract": "Handling
        spatial information is required by many database applications, and each poses
        different requirements on query languages. In many cases the precise size
        of the regions is important, while in other applications we may only be interested
        in the TOPOLOGICAL relations- hips between regions \u2014 intuitively, those
        that pertain to adjacency and connectivity properties of the regions, and
        are therefore invariant under homeomorphisms. Such differences in scope and
        emphasis are crucial, as they affect the data model, the query language, and
        performance. This talk focuses on queries targeted towards topological information
        for two- dimensional spatial databases, where regions are specified by polynomial
        inequalities with integer coeficients. We focus on two main aspects: (i) languages
        for expressing topological queries, and (ii) the representation of topological
        information. In regard to (i), we study several languages geared towards topological
        queries, building upon well-known topologi- cal relationships between pairs
        of planar regions proposed by Egenhofer. In regard to (ii), we show that the
        topological information in a spatial database can be precisely summarized
        by a finite relational database which can be viewed as a topological annotation
        to the raw spatial data. All topological queries can be answered using this
        annotation, called to- pological invariant. This yields a potentially more
        economical evaluation strategy for such queries, since the topological invariant
        is generally much smaller than the raw data. We examine in detail the problem
        of transla- ting topological queries against the spatial database into queries
        against the topological invariant. The languages considered are first-order
        on the spatial database side, and fixpoint and first-order on the topological
        in- variant side. In particular, it is shown that fixpoint expresses precisely
        the PTIME queries on topological invariants. This suggests that topolo- gical
        invariants are particularly well-behaved with respect to descriptive complexity.

        deal with certain basic topological relations such as \"A overlaps B\" and
        \"B contains C\" between simply connected regions in the plane. It is of great
        interest to make sound inferences from elementary statements of this form.
        This problem has been identified extensively in the recent literature, but
        very limited progress has been made towards addressing the considerable technical
        difficulties involved. In this paper we study the computational problems involved
        in developing such an inference system. We point out that the problem has
        two distinct components that interact in rather complex ways: relational consistency,
        and planarity. We develop polynomial-time algorithms for several important
        special cases, and prove almost all the others to be NP-hard.", "venue": "International

        The authors would like to thank the referees for their detailed comments,
        and for strengthening the result presented in Theorem 6. A plc of the rows
        of the array that does not contain any row from the bottom N=16 rows will
        always have at least one positive coordinate. This is because: (1) if the
        rows are chosen only from the top 3N=4 rows then it follows from the previous
        discussion that at least one coordinate in the rst four coordinates of the
        plc will have a positive coordinate, (2) if the plc has at least one row from
        among other rows (i.e., from row number 3N=4 + 1 to row number (N ?N=16))
        then consider the last four coordinates: it is a plc of rows that contains
        at least one row from among r 1 ; r 2 , and r 3 and does not contain r 4 ;
        hence, by property P4, at least one coordinate will be positive. Continue
        the procedure by adding log 4 N (= n=2) layers, each of which is 4 columns
        wide; thus constructing 2n columns. By then, any subset S that does not contain
        the very bottom row has the following property: any plc of the rows has at
        least one positive coordinate. Now change the ?1 in the 4th coordinate of
        the last row to a +1; this completes the construction of A. It follows from
        property P3 that any plc that contains the last row of A must have at least
        one positive coordinate in the rst 4 columns. As for the column sums, properties
        P1 and P2 ensure that they are all 0, except for the 4th column that we modiied
        in the last row, which sums to 2. 1. The matrix A in the above construction
        has identical rows. If one wants to construct an A with distinct rows, then
        one can add n extra columns to obtain an 2 n 3n matrix as follows: add n extra
        columns, such that each row has a unique identiier in these columns. Since
        we use all 2 n identiiers, each of these n columns sums to 0. 2. Since any
        plc of the rows of A has at least one positive coordinate, it implies that

        The theory of games [AH], founded by von Neumann and Morgenstern, is supposed
        to model the behavior of rational economic agents. Very often, however, game
        theory predicts behavior that can be criticized as unnatural and nonrational

        can be remedied if the model is modified to take into account appropriate

        general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and
        Horn core, respectively) was proposed in (SIC) as a form of \"''knowledge
        compilation,\" sup- porting rapid approximate reasoning; on the nega- tive
        side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain
        complexity drawbacks pointed out in (KPS). On the other hand, the many frameworks
        and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are
        plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case,
        as was pointed out in (EGZ?) and the present paper. More fundamentally, these
        schemes are not inductive, in that they lose in a single update any positive
        properties of the represented sets of formu- las (small size, Horn, etc.).
        In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, combin-
        ing Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and
        very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas
        is represented by an upper and lower Horn approxima- tion. To update, we replace
        the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update,
        and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact is
        that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula
        is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We
        conjecture that eficient al- gorithms are possible for more complex updates.",

        a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope
        and Horn core, respectively) was proposed in [SK] as a form of \"knowledge
        compilation,\" supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side,
        this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity
        drawbacks pointed out in [KPS]. On the other hand, the many frameworks and
        schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued
        by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was
        pointed out in [EG2] and the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes
        are not inductive, in that they lose in a single update any positive properties
        of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn, etc.). In this paper
        we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, combining Horn approximation
        and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free
        of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented
        by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper
        Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly
        the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact is that Horn envelopes
        and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of
        a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that
        efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.", "venue": "AAAI

        "title": "Linear programming without the matrix", "abstract": "We study the
        problem facing a set of decision-makers who must select values for the variables
        of a linear program, when only parts of the matrix are available to each of
        them. The goal is to find a feasible solution that is as close to the true
        optimum as possible, When each decision-maker decides one variable and knows
        all constraints involving this variable, we show that the worst-case ratio
        is related tc,the maximum number of variables appearing in each constraint,
        and a simple \u201csafe\u201d heuristic is optimal. Since this problem involves
        constrained optimization, there is a novel criterion, besides the competitive
        ratio, comparing the performance of a heuristic with the best feasible distributed
        algorithm, perhaps specializing on the current inst ante; we show different
        bounds for this parameter. When the constraint structure (the zero-nonzero
        pattern of the matrix) is known in advance, and the variables are partitioned
        bet ween decision-makers, then the optimum ratio is a complicated parameter
        of the associated hypergraph, which we bound from above and below in terms
        of variants of clique and graph coloring; but several interesting special
        cases are characterized completely. 1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering,

        address the question of when the structure of a Datalog program with negation

        programs with negation, which we call the tie\u2013breaking semantics. The
        tie\u2013breaking semantics can be computed in polynomial time, and results
        in a fix-point whenever the rule\u2013goal graph of the program has no cycle
        with an odd number of negative edges. We show that, in some well-defined sense,
        this is the most general fixpoint semantics of negation possible; in particular
        we show that if a cycle with an odd number of negative edges is present, then
        the logic program is not structurally total, that is, it has an alphabetic
        variant which has no fixpoint semantics whatsoever. Determining whether a

        bisecting a polygon into two equal (possibly disconnected) parts with the

        It is desirable that the surviving nodes continue to operate, but no two disjoint
        partitions operate independently. One SOIUtion for this problem is based on
        the notion of coteries. A coterie is a family of sets of nodes such that any
        two sets in the family intersect. in the protocol implied by a coterie, a
        connected subgraph of the network functions if its set of nodes contains one
        of the sets in the family. One simple way to implement coteries is by voting.
        We study the following problem: Given a network with weigh ts, find the coterie
        that maximizes the expected number of operating nodes. We show that this problem,
        although hopelessly intractable in general, can be solved when the network
        is a cactus (all biconnected components are either edges or cycles). Even
        the case of a cycle with equal probabilities and weights is quite nontrivial

        through a weighted planar polygonal subdivision with <italic>n</italic> vertices
        is considered. Distances are measured according to a weighted Euclidean metric:
        The length of a path is defined to be the weighted sum of (Euclidean) lengths
        of the subpaths within each region. An algorithm that constructs a (restricted)
        \u201cshortest path map\u201d with respect to a given source point is presented.
        The output is a partitioning of each edge of the subdivion into intervals
        of \u03b5-optimality, allowing an \u03b5-optimal path to be traced from the
        source to any query point along any edge. The algorithm runs in worst-case
        time <italic>O</italic>(<italic>ES</italic>) and requires <italic>O</italic>(<italic>E</italic>)
        space, where  <italic>E</italic> is  the number of \u201cevents\u201d in our
        algorithm and <italic>S</italic> is the time it takes to run a numerical search
        procedure. In the worst case, <italic>E</italic> is bounded above by <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>4</supscrpt>)
        (and we give an &OHgr;(<italic>n</><supscrpt>4</supscrpt>) lower bound), but
        it is likeky that <italic>E</italic> will be much smaller in practice. We
        also show that <italic>S</italic> is bounded by <italic>O</italic>(<italic>n</italic><supscrpt>4</supscrpt><italic>L</italic>),
        where <italic>L</italic> is the precision of the problem instance (including
        the number of bits in the user-specified tolerance \u03b5). Again, the value
        of <italic>S</italic> should be smaller in practice. The algorithm applies
        the \u201ccontinuous  Dijkstra\u201d paradigm  and exploits the fact that
        shortest paths obey Snell''s Law of Refraction at region boundaries, a   local
        optimaly property of shortest paths that is well known from the analogous
        optics model. The algorithm generalizes to the multi-source case to compute

        (1875) and Somoff (1897), and more recently by Lakshmin arayana (1978), that
        the form closure of a two-dimensional object requires at least four wrenches,
        and that form closure of a three-dimensional object requires at least seven
        wrenches. It was also conjectured that these numbers can be achieved by wrenches
        realizable as forces normal to the surface of the object (such wrenches are
        called fingers). In this paper we prove this conjecture. In particular we
        show that form closure of any two-dimensional bounded object with piecewise
        smooth boundary (except a circle) can be achieved by four fingers. For three
        dimensions, we prove that form closure of any bounded object with piecewise
        smooth boundary can be achieved with 12 fingers if and only if the object
        does not have a rotational symmetry (in which case, of course, form closure
        is not achievable, since no moment along the axis of symmetry can be opposed).
        We also show that, under very general conditions, form closure of three-dimensional
        objects without rotational symmetries can be achieved with seven fingers.
        Finally, we show that when Coulomb friction is taken into account, under the
        most relaxed assumptions three fingers are necessary and sufficient in two
        dimensions, and four fingers in three dimensions.", "venue": "Int. J. Robotics

        \"between\" the classes FP and FNP. These classes are contained (along with
        factoring, and (JPY)''s class PLS) in the class TFNP of search problems that
        always have a solu- tion. A problem in each of these new classes is de- fined
        in terms of an implicitly given, exponentially large graph, very much like
        PLS. The existence of the solution sought is established via a simple graph-
        theoretic lemma with an inefficiently constructive proof; for example, PLS
        can be thought of as cor- responding to the lemma \"every dag has a sink.\"
        The new classes are based on lemmata such as \"ev- ery graph has an even number
        of odd-degree nodes.\" We show several class containments and collapses, resulting
        in the two new classes PDLF C PLF; the relation of either class to PLS is
        open. PLF contains several important problems for which no polynom''al time
        algorithm is presently known, including the lin- ear complementarity problem
        for P-matrices, finding a mixed equilibrium in a non-zero sum game, find-
        ing a second Hamilton circuit in a Hamiltonian cubic graph, finding a second
        Hamiltonian decomposition in a quartic graph, and the computational versions

        make it Eulerian) is unbounded. The main result is an algorithm that achieves
        a bounded ratio when the deficiency is bounded; unfortunately the ratio is
        exponential in the deficiency. It is also shown that, when partial information
        about the graph is available, minimizing the worst-case ratio is PSPACE-complete.<<ETX>>",

        "title": "Computational complexity of generalized graph coloring problems",
        "abstract": "In this work we study a wide class of problems in graph theory,
        called generalized node-coloring problems, defined as follows: given graphs
        $G$ and $H$, can the nodes of $H$ be colored with $k$ colors to avoid containing
        $G$ as a subgraph in each color component? \nFor each fixed choice of $G$
        and $k$, we denote such problem as the generalized coloring problem with respect
        to $G$ and $k$, or GCP$\\sb{G,k}$. When $G$ is $K\\sb2$ (i.e., a single edge),
        then GCP$\\sb{K\\sb2,k}$ becomes the ordinary node-coloring problem (OCP$\\sb{k}$).
        Therefore, the class of problems we consider is a natural generalization of
        the OCP, generalizing the forbidden subgraph from $K\\sb2$ to an arbitrary
        one. The generalized coloring problems are abstractions of graph partitioning
        problems that are of interest in distributed operating systems, constraint
        satisfaction in artificial intelligence, VLSI design, and resource allocation.
        \nWe completely characterize the complexity of the class of generalized coloring
        problems GCP$\\sb{G,k}$. In fact, this characterization is a special case
        of our complete characterization of the class of all the problems of avoiding
        any nontrivial finite family of graphs $F$ (denoted GCP$\\sb{F,k}$), rather
        than a single graph. We prove that all such problems are NP-complete for three
        or more colors. For two colors, they are NP-complete when $F$ does not contain
        a graph of maximum degree one. Otherwise, it is in ${\\cal P}$, and we exhibit
        a polynomial-time (in fact, ${\\cal NC}$) algorithm for the solution of such
        problems. \nWe also consider what happens when $G$ is part of the input. This
        problem, denoted $GCP\\sb{k}$, can be viewed as the composition of an NP-complete
        problem with a co-NP-complete problem. We show that, in this case, deciding
        whether $H$ can be colored (even with two colors) to avoid $G$ is $\\Sigma\\sbsp{2}{p}$-complete.
        This result involves an interesting extension of our reduction techniques,
        and appears to be the first natural graph problem known to be complete for
        an intermediate level of the polynomial hierarchy. \nThe same techniques can
        be generalized to prove the $\\Sigma\\sbsp{2}{p}$-completeness of other related
        problems, including that of the Generalized Node Deletion Problem with forbidden
        subgraphs being part of the input. This theorem is an extension of the results
        of Yannakakis, who proved NP-hardness of Node Deletion Problems with fixed
        forbidden graphs. This result is in turn used in establishing the $\\Sigma\\sbsp{2}{p}$-completeness
        of the Clause Maintenance System, an important paradigm in artificial intelligence.",

        After this, it is established that a set of universal Horn clauses has a first-order
        circumscription if and only if it is bounded (when considered as a logic program);
        thus it is undecidable to tell whether such formulas have first-order circumscription.

        in polynomial time by dynamic programming finite horizon problems, linear
        programming, or successive approximation techniques infinite horizon. We show
        that they are complete for P, and therefore most likely cannot be solved by
        highly parallel algorithms. We also show that, in contrast, the deterministic
        cases of all three problems can be solved very fast in parallel. The version
        with partially observed states is shown to be PSPACE-complete, and thus even
        less likely to be solved in polynomial time than the NP-complete problems;
        in fact, we show that, most likely, it is not possible to have an efficient
        on-line implementation involving polynomial time on-line computations and
        memory of an optimal policy, even if an arbitrary amount of precomputation

        Fortune and Grosse that any two-dimensional polygonal object can be prehended
        stably with three fingers, so that its weight (along the third dimension)
        is balanced. Besides, in this paper we show that form closure of a polygon
        object can be achieved by four fingers (previous proofs were not complete).
        We formulate and solve the problem of finding the optimum stable grip or form
        closure of any given polygon. For stable grip it is most natural to minimize
        the forces needed to balance through friction the object''''s weight along
        the third dimension. For form closure, we minimize the worst-case forces needed
        to balance any unit force acting on the center of gravity of the object. The
        mathematical techniques used in the two instances are an interesting mix of
        Optimization and Euclidean geometry. Our results lead to algorithms for the
        efficient computation of the optimum grip in each case.", "venue": "Int. J.

        for determining the shortest path between a source and a destination on an

        from the source to any other destination may be determined using standard
        techniques in time O(log n) by locating the destination in the subdivision
        created by the algorithm. The actual shortest path from the source to a destination
        can be reported in time O(k+ log n), where k is the number of faces crossed
        by the path. The algorithm generalizes to the case of multiple source points

        "A queuing system with infinitely many servers, and with the following queuing
        discipline is considered: For any two jobs <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>
        in the system, such that <italic>i</italic> arrived later than <italic>j</italic>,
        there is a fixed probability <italic>p</italic> that <italic>i</italic> will
        have to wait for <italic>j</italic>''s execution to terminate before <italic>i</italic>
        starts executing. This queuing system is a very simple model for database
        concurrency control via \u201cstatic\u201d locking, as well as of parallel
        execution of programs consisting of several interdependent processes. The
        problem of determining the maximum arrival rate (as a function of <italic>p</italic>)
        that can be sustained before this system becomes unstable is studied. It is
        shown that this rate is inversely proportional to <italic>p</italic>, and
        close upper and lower bounds on the constant for the case of deterministic
        departures are found. The result suggests that the degree of multiprogramming
        of multiuser databases, or the level of parallelism of concurrent programs,
        is inversely proportional to the probability of conflict, and that the constant
        is small and known within a factor of 2. The technique used involves the computation
        of certain asymptotic parameters of a random infinite directed acyclic graph

        we introduce a new notion of multiversion serializability (MVSR) based on
        conflicts (MVCSR), and discuss its relation with the well known single version
        conflict serializability (CSR). On-line schedulable (OLS) subsets of (MVSR)
        were defined in Papadimitriou and Kanellakis, ACM Trans. Database Systems
        9, No. 1 (1984). We prove there that it is NP-complete to decide whether a
        set of schedules is OLS. We next introduce the concept of maximal OLS sets,
        and show that no efficient scheduler can be designed that recognizes maximal
        subsets of the MVSR or MVCSR schedules.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART

        is a study of the apparent intractability of problems in decentralized decision-making,
        using the concepts and methods of Complexity Theory. We first establish that
        the discrete version of an important paradigm for this area, proposed by Witsenhausen,
        is NP-complete, thus explaining the failures reported in the literature to
        attack it computationally. In the rest of the paper we show that the computational
        intractability of the discrete version of a control problem can imply that
        there are no satisfactory (continuous) algorithms for the continuous version.
        To this effect, we develop a theory of continuous algorithms and their complexity,
        and an analytical methodology, which can prove quite interesting by themselves.",

        requiring that a specified view complement (i.e., a second view that contains
        all the information omitted from the given view) remain constant during the
        translation. Some of the computational problems related to the apphcafion
        of this general methodology in the context of relational databases are studied.
        Projective views of databases that consist of a single relation and satisfy
        funcuonal dependencies are emphasized. After characterizing complementary
        views, the authors show that finding a minimum complement of a given view
        is NP-complete. The problem of translating the insertion of a tuple into a
        view is then studied in detail, and the results are extended to the cases
        of deletion and replacement of a tuple. Finally, the explicit functional dependencies,
        a new kind of dependency that intuitively states that some part of the database
        information can be computed from the rest, are defined and studied.", "venue":

        "title": "Games against nature", "abstract": "In Com,puter Science, important
        concepts usually come with a plethora of alternative characterizations. The
        class PSPACE, for example, can be defined either as the class of problelns
        solvable in polynomially bounded space by a multitape Turing machine or some
        similar model, or, equivalently, as the class of problems reducible to some
        polynomial-depth combinatorial two-person game [Stocklneyer and Meyer, Schaefer].
        Alternation [Chandra and Stockmeyer] is an interesting variant of the latter
        point of view. A more recent, also \"problem-oriented\" characterization of
        PSPACE is the one in terms of problems involving periodic objects [Orlin].
        In this paper, we propose a new characterization of PSPACE, based on some
        of the most classical and well-looked at problems in Optimization: decision-making
        under uncertainty. Problems in this class are usually characterized by a discretetime
        random process, the parameters of which can be influenced by dynamic decisions.
        Decisions are based on the current state. The goal is to minimize thge expectation
        of some cost functional of the history of states and decisions. There is a
        vast .literature on the numerous variants of this problem; the reader is referred
        for a start to the books by [Denardo, Der.man, IIoward, Bertsekas]. Typically,
        such a problem is solved by dynamic programming (ill fact, decision-making
        under uncertainty. was the original and intend.ed application of this technique),
        with a time and space cost which are usually exponential in the description
        of the input. In a handful of now classical cases, more clever special techniques
        have yielded polynomialtime algorithms [Howard, Derman]. Linear programming
        is sometimes employed. We can formulate a decision problem under uncertain.ty

        that every manager is an employee) are studied, including their interaction
        with functional dependencies, or FDs. A simple complete axiomatization for
        INDs is presented, and the decision problem for INDs is shown to be PSPACE-complete.
        (The decision problem for INDs is the problem of determining whether or not
        \u03a3 logically implies \u03c3, given a set \u03a3 of INDs and a single IND
        \u03c3). It is shown that finite implication (implication over databases with
        a finite number of tuples) is the same as unrestricted implications for INDs,
        although finite implication and unrestricted implication are distinct for
        FDs and INDs taken together. It is shown that, although there are simple complete
        axiomatizations for FDs alone and for INDs alone, there is no complete axiomatization
        for FDs and INDs taken together, in which every rule is k-ary for some fixed
        k (and in particular, there is no finite complete axiomatization.) This is
        true whether we consider finite implication or unrestricted implication, and
        is true even if no relation scheme has more than three attributes. The nonexistence
        of a k-ary complete axiomatization for FDs and INDs taken together is proven
        by giving a condition which is necessary and sufficient in general for the
        existence of a k-ary complete axiomatization.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART

        "We present a formal framework for distributed databases, and we study the
        complexity of the concurrency control problem in this framework. Our transactions
        are partially ordered sets, of actions, as opposed to the straight-line programs
        of the centralized case. The concurrency control algorithm, or scheduler,
        is itself a distributed program. Three notions of performance of the scheduler
        are studied and interrelated: (i) its parallelism, (ii) the computational
        complexity of the problems it needs to solve, and (iii) the cost of communication
        between the various parts of the scheduler. We show that the number of messages
        necessary and sufficient to support a given level of parallelism is equal
        to the minmax value of a combinatorial game. We show that this game is PSPACE-complete.
        It follows that, unless NP=PSPACE, a scheduler cannot simultaneously minimize
        communication and be computationally efficient. This result, we argue, captures
        the quantum jump in complexity of the transition from centralized to distributed
        concurrency control problems.", "venue": "22nd Annual Symposium on Foundations

        The most inlportnnt paradigm in this area is bin packing [JDGGU, J02, Yao,

        elegance and depth of the cOlnbinatorial arguments employed in the proofs

        them. Despite the presence of the unifying cotlcept of a weighting [unction,
        the arguments are usually ingenious yet ad hoc, and the construction of worst-case
        exmnp)es is largely decoupled from the upper bounding process. In this paper
        we present a fanlily of results concerning certain extrenlal properties of
        planar graphs. In particular we show the follo\\ving: (1) The greedy heuristic
        (i.e., repeatedly pick the node with smallest degree and delete its neighborhood)
        applied to a planar graph with n nodes yields an independent set of size at
        least 4n/21. (2) l''he greedy heuristic yields an independent set at )etlst
        23/63 times the optimum. (3) A planar graph with n nodes and minimum degree
        3 has ahvays a nzatching with fewer than n/3 free nodes.", "venue": "22nd

        times when a given buffer capacity is used. We also analyze an efficient heuristic
        for solving the 1-buffer problem, showing that it has a 3/2 worst-case performance.
        Furthermore, we show that the \"no-wait\" (i.e., zero buffer) flowshop scheduling

        [Codd 1970, Ullman 1979] has gained recognition as a valuable formal framework
        for understanding the semantics, design, and even implementation, of databases.
        At the heart of the research on relational databases lies the notion of data
        dependency. Data dependencies are domain-independent (Le., invariant under
        consistent renamings of domain elements) predicates on databases. Starting
        ,vith functional [Armstrong 1974] and muttivalued [Fagin 1977] dependencies,
        a dozen of different kinds of data dependencies have been proposed in the
        literature [Nicolas 1978, Paradaens 1979, Sagiv and Walecka 1979, and others].
        New, more and more general, kinds of data dependencies have been put forward
        in a rather arbitrary and heuristic fashion. This reflected two major frustrations
        of the research in this area: First, no natural, stable closure of this process
        was in sight. Secondly, the elegant complete axiomatizations of functional
        [Armstrong 1974] and multivalued dependencies [Beeri et ale 1977] did not
        appear to carry over to the more general kinds; thus the further generalizations
        were futile attempts at \"enriching the language\" enough so as to obtain
        a complete axiomatization.", "venue": "21st Annual Symposium on Foundations

        is of great interest to make sound inferences from elementary statements of
        this form. This problem has been identi ed extensively in the recent literature,
        but very limited progress has been made towards addressing the considerable
        technical di culties involved. In this paper we study the computational problems
        involved in developing such an inference system. We point out that the problem
        has two distinct components that interact in rather complex ways: relational
        consistency, and planarity. We develop polynomial-time algorithms for several
        important special cases, and prove almost all the others to be NP-hard.",

        "In the preceding chapters we have seen some elegant design principles\u2014such
        as divide-and-conquer, graph exploration, and greedy choice\u2014that yield
        definitive algorithms for a variety of important computational tasks. The
        drawback of these tools is that they can only be used on very specific types
        of problems. We now turn to the two sledgehammers of the algorithms craft,
        dynamic programming and linear programming, techniques of very broad applicability
        that can be invoked when more specialized methods fail. Predictably, this
        generality often comes with a cost in efficiency. At the conclusion of our
        study of shortest paths (Chapter 4), we observed that the problem is especially
        easy in directed acyclic graphs (dags). Let''s recapitulate this case, because
        it lies at the heart of dynamic programming. The special distinguishing feature
        of a dag is that its nodes can be linearized; that is, they can be arranged
        on a line so that all edges go from left to right (Figure 6.1). To see why
        this helps with shortest paths, suppose we want to figure out distances from
        node S to the other nodes. For concreteness, let''s focus on node D. The only
        way to get to it is through its Figure 6.1 A dag and its linearization (topological

        the great obsessions of Renaissance sages was the solution of polynomial equations:
        find an x that causes a certain polynomial to evaluate to 0. Today we all
        learn in school how to solve quadratic equations (polynomial equations of
        degree two, such as ax + bx + c = 0), even though many of us have to look
        up the formula every time (it\u2019s x = 1 2a (\u2212b\u00b1 \u221a b \u2212
        4ac)). Versions of this formula were known to the Babylonians as early as
        2000 BC, and were rediscovered in many ancient cultures. The discovery of
        similar but much more complicated formulas for solving equations of degree
        three and four \u2014 the cubic and quartic formulae \u2014 had to wait until
        the 16th century AD. During the next three centuries, the greatest minds in
        Europe strove unsuccessfully to discover the quintic formula, cracking equations
        of degree five, until the flowering of modern algebra brought the quest to
        a sudden, surprising resolution: A proof that there is no quintic formula.
        This story, on first hearing, can engender a few natural reactions. Among
        them, surprise \u2014 what\u2019s the obstacle to a quintic formula? Why was
        it so hard to prove it didn\u2019t exist? And, more subtly, a mild sense of
        perplexity \u2014 what do we mean by a quintic formula anyway? Why can\u2019t
        we write \u201cthe largest x such that ax + bx + cx + dx + ex + f = 0\u201d
        and declare this to be a formula? So we back up. By a \u201cformula\u201d
        in this story, we meant a particular thing: a finite sequence of steps that
        begins with the given values of the coefficients and ends with a root x; each
        step consists of one of the basic arithmetic operations applied to certain
        of the quantities already computed, or else it consists of the extraction
        of a root of one of the quantities already computed. Now we can assert more
        precisely, thanks to the work of the nineteenth-century mathematicians Abel
        and Galois: there is no quintic formula. Viewed from the safe distance of
        a few centuries, the story is clearly one about computation, and it contains
        many of the key ingredients that arise in later efforts to model computation:
        We take a computational process that we understand intuitively (solving an
        equation, in this case), formulate a precise model, and from the model derive
        some highly unexpected consequences about the computational power of the process.
        It is precisely this approach that we wish to apply to computation in general.

        Under diierent semantics, diierent race conditions may occur. We h a ve proposed
        and implemented a tool which can be used to analyze message sequence charts
        to locate and visualize design errors as early as possible in a design cycle.
        The tool conforms to ITU recommendation Z.120. We h a ve noted that extensions
        of the tool, to gently integrate formal veriication techniques further into
        the design process, are possible. It is our intention to use the formal representation
        of MSCs described here as a v ehicle for exploring such extensions. Acknowledgements:
        We t h a n k C h uck Kalmanek, Bob Kurshan, and Mi-halis Yannakakis for many
        fruitful discussions. We are also grateful to Brian Kernighan, who developed
        a port of the MSC analyzer for Windows PCs. by successive a p p r o ximation.
        The tool allows the user to construct, edit, and analyze MSCs interactively.
        The charts may be stored in the ITU standard form (Z.120), in textual form
        as conventional annotated scenarios, or in graphical form, as PostScript les.
        Annotations to the MSC can be entered in comment boxes that become part of
        the scenario as displayed. For the online analysis of interpreted MSCs, the
        tool supports the four pre-deened semantics choices listed in Figure 4 through
        menu choices. Other user-deened semantics can easily be incorporated. The
        analysis for race conditions is invoked by clicking on a button labeled`Check..''.
        A menu is then created listing all connicts that can occur for the chosen
        semantic interpretation of the chart. By selecting a connict from a menu-list,
        the corresponding event pair is highlighted in the chart. The user can also
        set preferences so that only certain types of connicts (eg. between two receives,
        or between a send and a receive) are entered into the connict menus. The user
        can also select an event e, with a mouse click, and ask the tool to identify
        all related (or optionally all unrelated) events. Related are all those events
        that necessarily precede or follow e in the partial order. T h e t wo t ypes
        of events (i.e., following or preceding the selected event) are marked in
        diierent colors. For timing analysis, the user can annotate the chart with

        "Even as machine learning exceeds human-level performance on many applications,
        the generality, robustness, and rapidity of the brain''s learning capabilities
        remain unmatched. How cognition arises from neural activity is a central open
        question in neuroscience, inextricable from the study of intelligence itself.
        A simple formal model of neural activity was proposed in Papadimitriou [2020]
        and has been subsequently shown, through both mathematical proofs and simulations,
        to be capable of implementing certain simple cognitive operations via the
        creation and manipulation of assemblies of neurons. However, many intelligent
        behaviors rely on the ability to recognize, store, and manipulate temporal
        sequences of stimuli (planning, language, navigation, to list a few). Here
        we show that, in the same model, time can be captured naturally as precedence
        through synaptic weights and plasticity, and, as a result, a range of computations
        on sequences of assemblies can be carried out. In particular, repeated presentation
        of a sequence of stimuli leads to the memorization of the sequence through
        corresponding neural assemblies: upon future presentation of any stimulus
        in the sequence, the corresponding assembly and its subsequent ones will be
        activated, one after the other, until the end of the sequence. Finally, we
        show that any finite state machine can be learned in a similar way, through
        the presentation of appropriate patterns of sequences. Through an extension
        of this mechanism, the model can be shown to be capable of universal computation.
        We support our analysis with a number of experiments to probe the limits of
        learning in this model in key ways. Taken together, these results provide
        a concrete hypothesis for the basis of the brain''s remarkable abilities to
        compute and learn, with sequences playing a vital role.", "venue": "", "year":

        revisit the planning problem in the blocks world, and we implement a known
        heuristic for this task. Importantly, our implementation is biologically plausible,
        in the sense that it is carried out exclusively through the spiking of neurons.
        Even though much has been accomplished in the blocks world over the past five
        decades, we believe that this is the first algorithm of its kind. The input
        is a sequence of symbols encoding an initial set of block stacks as well as
        a target set, and the output is a sequence of motion commands such as \"put
        the top block in stack 1 on the table\". The program is written in the Assembly
        Calculus, a recently proposed computational framework meant to model computation
        in the brain by bridging the gap between neural activity and cognitive function.
        Its elementary objects are assemblies of neurons (stable sets of neurons whose
        simultaneous firing signifies that the subject is thinking of an object, concept,
        word, etc.), its commands include project and merge, and its execution model
        is based on widely accepted tenets of neuroscience. A program in this framework
        essentially sets up a dynamical system of neurons and synapses that eventually,
        with high probability, accomplishes the task. The purpose of this work is
        to establish empirically that reasonably large programs in the Assembly Calculus
        can execute correctly and reliably; and that rather realistic --- if idealized
        --- higher cognitive functions, such as planning in the blocks world, can
        be implemented successfully by such programs.", "venue": "AAAI Conference

        that computational models based on assemblies of neurons can serve as a blueprint

        models of assemblies that have been demonstrated to mediate higher cognitive

        "Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide; late diagnosis
        and drug resistance are two major factors often responsible for high morbidity
        and treatment failure. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a dynamic
        process that has been closely linked with cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
        have been also associated with several cancer-related mechanisms, including
        EMT. We conducted a literature search in the PubMed database in order to sum
        up and discuss the role of lncRNAs in regulating OC-related EMT and their
        underlying mechanisms. Seventy (70) original research articles were identified,
        as of 23 April 2023. Our review concluded that the dysregulation of lncRNAs
        is highly associated with EMT-mediated OC progression. A comprehensive understanding

        "abstract": "The subject-verb-object (SVO) word order prevalent in English
        is shared by about $42\\%$ of world languages. Another $45\\%$ of all languages
        follow the SOV order, $9\\%$ the VSO order, and fewer languages use the three
        remaining permutations. None of the many extant explanations of this phenomenon
        take into account the difficulty of implementing these permutations in the
        brain. We propose a plausible model of sentence generation inspired by the
        recently proposed Assembly Calculus framework of brain function. Our model
        results in a natural explanation of the uneven frequencies. Estimating the
        parameters of this model yields predictions of the relative difficulty of
        dis-inhibiting one brain area from another. Our model is based on the standard
        syntax tree, a simple binary tree with three leaves. Each leaf corresponds
        to one of the three parts of a basic sentence. The leaves can be activated
        through lock and unlock operations and the sequence of activation of the leaves
        implements a specific word order. More generally, we also formulate and algorithmically
        solve the problems of implementing a permutation of the leaves of any binary
        tree, and of selecting the permutation that is easiest to implement on a given
        binary tree.", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 26, "citationCount":

        "title": "GATA3 Promotes the Neural Progenitor State but Not Neurogenesis
        in 3D Traumatic Injury Model of Primary Human Cortical Astrocytes", "abstract":
        "Astrocytes are abundant cell types in the vertebrate central nervous system
        and can act as neural stem cells in specialized niches where they constitutively
        generate new neurons. Outside the stem cell niches, however, these glial cells
        are not neurogenic. Although injuries in the mammalian central nervous system
        lead to profound proliferation of astrocytes, which cluster at the lesion
        site to form a gliotic scar, neurogenesis does not take place. Therefore,
        a plausible regenerative therapeutic option is to coax the endogenous reactive
        astrocytes to a pre-neurogenic progenitor state and use them as an endogenous
        reservoir for repair. However, little is known on the mechanisms that promote
        the neural progenitor state after injuries in humans. Gata3 was previously
        found to be a mechanism that zebrafish brain uses to injury-dependent induction
        of neural progenitors. However, the effects of GATA3 in human astrocytes after
        injury are not known. Therefore, in this report, we investigated how overexpression
        of GATA3 in primary human astrocytes would affect the neurogenic potential
        before and after injury in 2D and 3D cultures. We found that primary human
        astrocytes are unable to induce GATA3 after injury. Lentivirus-mediated overexpression
        of GATA3 significantly increased the number of GFAP/SOX2 double positive astrocytes
        and expression of pro-neural factor ASCL1, but failed to induce neurogenesis,
        suggesting that GATA3 is required for enhancing the neurogenic potential of
        primary human astrocytes and is not sufficient to induce neurogenesis alone.",

        for regenerative medicine applications.", "abstract": "Tissue extracellular
        matrix (ECM) is a complex material made up of fibrous proteins and ground
        substance (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) that are secreted by cells. ECM contains
        important biological cues that modulate cell behaviors, and it also serves
        as a structural scaffold to which cells can adhere. For clinical applications,
        where immune rejection is a constraint, ECM can be processed using decellularization
        methods intended to remove cells and donor antigens from tissue or organs,
        while preserving native biological cues essential for cell growth and differentiation.
        In this study, a decellularized ECM-based composite hydrogel was formulated
        by using modified GAGs that covalently bind tissue particles. These GAG-ECM
        composite hydrogels combine the advantages of solid decellularized ECM scaffolds
        and pepsin-digested ECM hydrogels by facilitating ECM hydrogel formation without
        a disruptive enzymatic digestion process. Additionally, engineered hydrogels
        can contain more than one type of ECM (from bone, fat, liver, lung, spleen,
        cartilage, or brain), at various concentrations. These hydrogels demonstrated
        tunable gelation kinetics and mechanical properties, offering the possibility
        of numerous in vivo and in vitro applications with different property requirements.
        Retained bioactivity of ECM particles crosslinked into this hydrogel platform
        was confirmed by the variable response of stem cells to different types of
        ECM particles with respect to osteogenic differentiation in vitro, and bone
        regeneration in vivo. \u00a9 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res

        neurodegenerative disease in which accumulation of toxic amyloid-\u03b242
        (A\u03b242) peptides leads to synaptic degeneration, inflammation, neuronal
        death, and learning deficits. Humans cannot regenerate lost neurons in the
        case of AD in part due to impaired proliferative capacity of the neural stem/progenitor
        cells (NSPCs) and reduced neurogenesis. Therefore, efficient regenerative
        therapies should also enhance the proliferation and neurogenic capacity of
        NSPCs. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a regenerative organism, and we can learn
        the basic molecular programs with which we could design therapeutic approaches
        to tackle AD. For this reason, the generation of an AD-like model in zebrafish
        was necessary. Using our methodology, we can introduce synthetic derivatives
        of A\u03b242 peptide with tissue penetrating capability into the adult zebrafish
        brain, and analyze the disease pathology and the regenerative response. The
        advantage over the existing methods or animal models is that zebrafish can
        teach us how a vertebrate brain can naturally regenerate, and thus help us
        to treat human neurodegenerative diseases better by targeting endogenous NSPCs.
        Therefore, the amyloid-toxicity model established in the adult zebrafish brain
        may open new avenues for research in the field of neuroscience and clinical
        medicine. Additionally, the simple execution of this method allows for cost-effective
        and efficient experimental assessment. This manuscript describes the synthesis

        neural stem cell plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurodegeneration", "abstract":
        "Three-dimensional models of human neural development and neurodegeneration
        are crucial when exploring stem-cell-based regenerative therapies in a tissue-mimetic
        manner. However, existing 3D culture systems are not sufficient to model the
        inherent plasticity of NSCs due to their ill-defined composition and lack
        of controllability of the physical properties. Adapting a glycosaminoglycan-based,
        cell-responsive hydrogel platform, we stimulated primary and induced human
        neural stem cells (NSCs) to manifest neurogenic plasticity and form extensive
        neuronal networks in vitro. The 3D cultures exhibited neurotransmitter responsiveness,
        electrophysiological activity, and tissue-specific extracellular matrix (ECM)
        deposition. By whole transcriptome sequencing, we identified that 3D cultures
        express mature neuronal markers, and reflect the in vivo make-up of mature
        cortical neurons compared to 2D cultures. Thus, our data suggest that our
        established 3D hydrogel culture supports the tissue-mimetic maturation of
        human neurons. We also exemplarily modeled neurodegenerative conditions by
        treating the cultures with A\u03b242 peptide and observed the known human
        pathological effects of Alzheimer\u2019s disease including reduced NSC proliferation,
        impaired neuronal network formation, synaptic loss and failure in ECM deposition
        as well as elevated Tau hyperphosphorylation and formation of neurofibrillary
        tangles. We determined the changes in transcriptomes of primary and induced
        NSC-derived neurons after A\u03b242, providing a useful resource for further
        studies. Thus, our hydrogel-based human cortical 3D cell culture is a powerful
        platform for studying various aspects of neural development and neurodegeneration,
        as exemplified for A\u03b242 toxicity and neurogenic stem cell plasticity.
        Significance Neural stem cells (NSC) are reservoir for new neurons in human
        brains, yet they fail to form neurons after neurodegeneration. Therefore,
        understanding the potential use of NSCs for stem cell-based regenerative therapies
        requires tissue-mimetic humanized experimental systems. We report the adaptation
        of a 3D bio-instructive hydrogel culture system where human NSCs form neurons
        that later form networks in a controlled microenvironment. We also modeled

        Zebrafish Brain", "abstract": "Regenerative capacity of the brain is a variable
        trait within animals. Aquatic vertebrates such as zebrafish have widespread
        ability to renew their brains upon damage, while mammals have\u2014if not
        none\u2014very limited overall regenerative competence. Underlying cause of
        such a disparity is not fully evident; however, one of the reasons could be
        activation of peculiar molecular programs, which might have specific roles
        after injury or damage, by the organisms that regenerate. If this hypothesis
        is correct, then there must be genes and pathways that (a) are expressed only
        after injury or damage in tissues, (b) are biologically and functionally relevant
        to restoration of neural tissue, and (c) are not detected in regenerating
        organisms. Presence of such programs might circumvent the initial detrimental
        effects of the damage and subsequently set up the stage for tissue redevelopment
        to take place by modulating the plasticity of the neural stem/progenitor cells.
        Additionally, if transferable, those \u201cmolecular mechanisms of regeneration\u201d
        could open up new avenues for regenerative therapies of humans in clinical
        settings. This review focuses on the recent studies addressing injury/damage-induced
        molecular programs in zebrafish brain, underscoring the possibility of the
        presence of genes that could be used as biomarkers of neural plasticity and
        regeneration.", "venue": "BioMed Research International", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        "A battery of bioassays, including biological toxicity as well as in vitro
        mouse spleen lymphoproliferative responses and cytokine production, was conducted
        to compare the effectiveness of tertiary treatment methods such as coagulation
        (Coag) and absorption on granular activated carbon (GAC) and disinfection
        processes such as chlorination and ozonation in removing toxic or stress inducing
        agents from reclaimed wastewater. Whole effluent toxicity (WET) testing of
        secondary treated (ST) wastewater using as test species Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia
        magna and Tetrahymena thermophila as well as phytotoxicity revealed moderate
        toxicity effects that depend on the organism used. All bioassays exhibited
        decrease of the ecotoxicological responses after tertiary treatment. However,
        mitogenic responses were proved to be more sensitive. Endotoxin present in
        ST samples may be responsible for the increased strong lymphoproliferative
        activity as well as interleukin-1 (IL-1) production by mouse splenocytes.
        Tertiary treatment of ST with coagulation and/or adsorption on granular activated
        carbon (GAC) in combination with ozonation reduced WET to control levels.
        Ozonation alone or in combination with any other treatment removed endotoxin
        more efficiently than chlorination and thus reduced spleen lymphoproliferative
        responses and IL-1 production.", "venue": "Water Science and Technology",

        of immunological parameters. Secondary and tertiary mucicipal wastewater samples
        were examined for their physicochemical and microbiological characteristics
        as well as for their endotoxin concentrations. The ecotoxicological characteristics
        were assessed by a battery of bioassays, using Vibrio fischeri, Daphnia magna
        and Tetrahymena thermophilla as test species and phytotoxicity. The mitogenic
        responses of mouse splenocytes were as well used as bioassay. The cytokines
        of IL-1, IL-2, IL-10, IFNgamma and TNFalpha, were also determined in the supernatant
        of splenocyte cultures and served as molecular biomarkers. All bioassays exhibited
        decrease of the ecotoxicological responses after tertiary treatment. However,
        mitogenic responses were proved to be more sensitive. IL-1 increased, while
        IL-2 production was unaffected. The fact that IL-10 production increased in
        response to secondary treated effluents in conjunction with the increased
        endotoxin levels, suggest Th2 type immune responses. Although results obtained
        from the toxicity bioassays after the tertiary treatment showed comparable
        results to those of controls, cytokine levels indicated the induction of immune
        response even after tertiary treatment. Consequently, cytokine production
        could be used as a sensitive biomarker for the evaluation of treatment efficiency
        of the reclaimed wastewaters intended for reuse.", "venue": "Water Science

        This study was aimed at investigating whether cells of CFU-C derived colonies
        could form secondary colonies. Bone marrow cultures of volumes of agar medium
        between 25 \u03bcl and 75 \u03bcl contained in glass capillaries were stimulated
        with mouse lung-conditioned medium (MLCM) containing granulocyte/macrophage
        colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Agar gels with colonies of up to \u2265
        20 were blown out into identical culture medium, completely dispersed on a
        whirl-mix to single cell suspensions, and used for establishing secondary
        agar cultures. In these secondary cultures considerable numbers of secondary
        granulocytic, mixed granulocytic/macrophage and macrophage colonies as well
        as numerous clusters arose. In contrast, when single colonies were recultured,
        only few secondary cell aggregates were formed. When primary cultures containing
        up to \u2265 20 cell aggregates were used for serial reculture at intermittent
        intervals of 3 and 4 days, a 2 -7-fold increase of colony-forming cells was
        found in tertiary cultures as was monitored by 7 day colony counts. And by
        use of different kinds of CSF-containing media, an over 4-fold increase of
        secondary over primary colonies was obtained with bovine lung-conditioned
        medium (BLCM) in primary and L-cell-conditioned medium (LCCM) in secondary
        7 day cultures. Primary capillary cultures were found to be devoid of CFU-S.
        Also, setting up bone marrow cultures in petri dishes and stimulating with
        MLCM, growth of primary as well as secondary colonies was obtained. The results
        indicate some self-renewal potential of CFU-C in vitro.", "venue": "Zeitschrift

        breast carcinomas, in relation to the behavior and prognosis of the disease.
        Immunohistochemistry was performed for the detection of Axin expression in
        232 breast cancer tissues. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses
        were used to assess the relation of Axin expression with classic clinicopathological
        parameters, patients'' survival and various biologic markers Human Epidermal

        to Ki\u201067 and topoII\u03b1. Nuclear Axin was positively associated with
        tumor size. Stromal Axin showed a parallel association with lymph node status
        and HER\u20102. In the subgroup of lobular breast carcinomas, preserved Axin
        was found to exert an unfavorable impact on patients'' overall survival. Our
        findings indicate, for the first time, that in invasive breast cancer preserved

        "title": "Construction of evolutionary tree models for renal cell carcinoma
        from comparative genomic hybridization data.", "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma
        is characterized by an accumulation of complex chromosomal alterations during
        tumor progression. Chromosome 3p deletions are known to occur early in the
        carcinogenesis, but the nature of subsequent events, their interrelationships,
        and their sequence is poorly understood, as one usually only obtains a single
        \"view\" of the dynamic process of tumor development in a particular cancer
        patient. To address this limitation, we used comparative genomic hybridization
        analysis in combination with a distance-based and a branching-tree method
        to search for tree models of the oncogenesis process of 116 conventional (clear
        cell) renal carcinomas. This provides a means to analyze and model cancer
        development processes based on a more dynamic model, including the presence
        of multiple pathways, as compared with the fixed linear model first proposed
        by Vogelstein et al. (N. Engl. J. Med., 319: 525-532, 1988) for colorectal
        cancer. The most common DNA losses involved 3p (61%), 4q (50%), 6q (40%),
        9p (35%), 13q (37%), and Xq (21%). The most common gains were seen at chromosome
        17p and 17q (20%). The tree model derived from the distance-based method is
        consistent with the established theory that -3p is an important early event
        in conventional (clear cell) renal cancer and supports the prediction made
        from the branching tree that -4q is another important early event. Both tree
        models suggest that there may be two groups of clear cell renal cancers: one
        characterized by -6q, +17q, and + 17p, and another by -9p, -13q, and -18q.
        Putative prognostic parameters were -9p and -13q. The distance-based tree
        clarifies that -8p (present in 12% of tumors) is a late event, largely independent
        of other events. In summary, tree modeling of comparative genomic hybridization
        data provided new information on the interrelationships of genetic changes
        in renal cancer and their possible order, as well as a clustering of these
        events. Using tree analysis, one can derive a more in-depth understanding
        of the renal cancer development process than is possible by simply focusing
        on the frequencies of genetic events in a given cancer type.", "venue": "Cancer

        geneticists seek to identify genetic changes in tumor cells and to relate
        the genetic changes to tumor development. Because single changes can disrupt
        the cell cycle and promote other genetic changes, it is extremely hard to
        distinguish cause from effect. In this article we illustrate how 7 techniques
        from statistics, theoretical computer science, and phylogenetics can be used
        to infer and test possible models of tumor progression from single genome\u2010wide
        descriptions of aberrations in a large sample of tumors. Specifically, we
        propose 4 tree models for tumor progression inferred from the large ovarian
        cancer data set described in the first 2 articles in this series. The models
        are derived from 2 different methods to select the non\u2010random genetic
        aberrations and 2 different methods to infer the trees, given a set of events.
        Various aspects of the tree models are tested and extended by 5 methods: overall
        tests of independence, likelihood ratio tests, principal components analysis,
        directed acyclic graph modeling, and Bayesian survival analysis. All our methods
        lead to strikingly consistent conclusions about chromosomal breakpoints in
        ovarian adenocarcinoma, including (1) the non\u2010random breakpoints in ovarian
        adenocarcinoma do not occur independently; (2) breakpoints in regions 1p3
        and 11p1 are important early events and distinguish a class of tumors associated
        with poor prognosis; and (3) breakpoints in 1p1, 3p1, and 1q2 distinguish

        any classical optimization problem, the corresponding segmentation problem
        seeks to partition a set of cost vectors into several segments, so that the
        overall cost is optimized. This framework contains a number of standard combinatorial
        clustering problems as special cases, and many segmentation problems turn
        out to beMAXSNP-complete even when the corresponding \u201cun-segmented\u201d
        version is easy to solve. We develop approximation algorithms for two natural
        and interesting problems in this class \u2014 the HYPERCUBE SEGMENTATION PROBLEM

        which can be specialized to approximate a large class of segmentation problems.

        are to be extracted automatically, presumably for subsequent human evaluation
        of the extent in which they are interesting. Automatically focusi ng on the
        \u201cinteresting\u201d patterns has received very limited for mal treatment.
        Patterns are often deemed \u201cinteresting\u201d on the basis of theirconfidence
        and support [1], information content[24], andunexpectedness [17, 23]. The
        more promising concept ofactionability\u2014 the ability of the pattern to
        suggest concrete and profitable action by the decision-makers [18, 21, 23]
        \u2014 has not been defined rigorously or elaborated on in the data mining
        literature. We want to develop a theory of the value of extracted patterns.
        We believe that the question can only be addressed in a microeconomicframework.
        A pattern in the data is interesting only to the extent in which it can be
        used in the decision-making process of the enterprise to increase util ity.1
        Any enterprise faces an optimization problem, which can generally be stated
        as max x2D f(x); whereD is the domain of all possible decisions (production
        plans, marketing strategies, etc.), and f(x) is theutility or valueof decisionx
        2 D. Such optimization problems are the object of study in optimization and
        microeconomics. 2 The feasible regionD and the objectivef(x) are both comparably
        complex components of the problem \u2014and classical optimization theory
        often treats them in a unified way via Lagrange multipliers and penalty functions
        [3]. Howeve r, from our point of view there is a major difference between
        the two: the feasible region D is basically endogenous to the enterprise,
        while the objective function f(x) is a function that reflects the enterprise\u2019s
        interaction with a multitude of other agents in the market (customers, suppliers,
        employee s, 1To quote [6],\u201cmerely finding the patterns is not enough.
        You must be able to respond to the patterns, to act on them, ultimately tu
        rning the data into information, the information into action, and the acti
        on into value.\u201d 2There is such an optimization problem associated with
        virtu ally every enterprise; however in real life such problems are so involved
        and complex, that often nobody knows exactly their detailed formulation .
        The decisionmakers of the enterprise base their decisions on a very rough
        , approximate, and heuristic understanding of the nature and behavior of th
        e underlying optimization problem. The fact that the details of the optim
        ization problem being solved are nebulous and unknown to the decision-maker
        s does not make the problem less real \u2014or its mathematical study less
        us eful. In fact, economic theory during this century has flourished on models
        such as these, in which the precise nature of the functions involved is esse
        ntially unknowable; the mathematical insights derived from the abstract p
        roblem are still valuable as heuristic guides in decision-making. competitors,
        the rest of the world). That is, at a first approx imation the objective function
        can be rewritten as f(x) =Xi2C fi(x); whereC is a set of agents or other factors
        influencing the utility of the enterprise. We shall be calling elements of
        C \u201ccustomers.\u201d We shall be deliberately vague on what they are.
        There are two different possible views here: On a concrete level, we can think
        of them as profiles of customers and other relevant agents, about whom we
        have gathered relevant information by a first stage of data mining; it is
        this fir t stage that our point of view seeks to influence and direct. A more
        abstract, but potentially equally useful, point of vie w s that, alternatively,
        we can also think of the elements of C as rows of the raw table being mined
        \u2014customers, transactions, shipments, and so on. What makes this relevant
        to data mining is the following crucial assumption: we assume that the contribution
        of customeri to the utilityof the enterprise under decision x, fi(x), is in
        fact a complicated function of the data we have on customeri. Let yi denote
        the data we have on customer i; then fi(x) is justg(x; yi), some fixed function
        of the decision and the data. Hence, our problem is to max x2DXi2C g(x; yi):
        The conventional practice in studying such problems is to replace Pi2C g(x;
        yi) by g(x; \u0177), where \u0177 is someaggregatevalue3 (aggregate demand
        of a product, aggregate consumer utility function, etc.). Such aggregation
        is understood to be inaccurate, resulting in suboptimal decisio ns, because
        ofnon-linearities(non-zero second partial derivatives) in the functiong(x;
        yi). Aggregation has been tolerated in traditional microeconomics because
        (1) the computa tional requirements otherwise would be enormous, and (2) it
        is difficult to obtain the datayi. The point in data mining, in our view,
        is thatwe now have the computational power and wealth of data necessary to
        attack the unaggregated optimization problem, to study the intricate ways
        in which corre lations and clusters in the data affect the enterprise\u2019s

        this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity
        drawbacks pointed out in 17]. On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes
        proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious
        complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out
        in 6], and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally,
        these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update
        any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn
        structure, etc.). In this paper 1 we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation,
        which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is
        inductive and very eecient, free of the problems facing its constituents.
        A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation.
        To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change
        update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key
        fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to
        compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update
        of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that eecient algorithms are possible

        The mainstay of treatment for a retroperitoneal Schwannoma is surgical excision
        or enucleation. The surgical approach is decided by the site and size of the
        tumour. An abdominal approach is recommended for a tumour in the upper presacral
        region, whereas a tumour located over the lower 10 cm of sacrum and coccyx
        and less than 8 cm in size can be approached by a transsacral route. However,
        pelvic Schwannomas are difficult to excise because they arise in the nerve
        roots and resection inevitably leaves a degree of disability. Resection is
        only undertaken if the pressure on the spinal cord or the nerve roots is threatening
        function, and on the understanding that there will be some permanent neurological
        loss. Also pelvic tumour may be associated with the involvement of pelvic
        bones, vessels and major pelvic nerves, as despite their benign nature, these
        tumours may erode into adjacent structures. This case illustrates that an
        asymptomatic, uncomplicatedlooking tumour mass may be managed conservatively.
        This is particularly pertinent where a surgical procedure might carry considerable
        morbidity. Conservative management of Schwannoma has been reported for acoustic
        neuromas, but the conservative management of pelvic Schwannoma has not been
        reported in the literature to date (Strasnick et al. 1994).", "venue": "Journal

        "BACKGROUND\nActinomycosis is a chronic infection caused by Actinomyces israeli,
        a gram-positive saprophytic anaerob, a normal inhabitant of the upper intestinal
        tract.\n\n\nCASE\nWe report a case of a 35-year-old female with an intrauterine
        device (IUD) who appeared in the emergency department with clinical characteristics
        of appendicitis. Ultrasound and computed tomography were performed, revealing
        an ovarian tumor formation and acute appendicitis. The patient underwent exploratory
        laparotomy, unilateral ovarectomy due to acute abscess and finally appendectomy.
        Diagnosis of actinomycosis was established with the presence of sulphur granules
        microscopically. The patient received penicillin for an extended period. Two
        years have passed and no clinical recurrence was mentioned.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nActinomycosis
        is not easily apparent because of its rarity. Inflammatory intestinal and
        pelvic disease can easily mislead the diagnosis, giving the impression of
        a neoplastic process. The drug of choice is penicillin, initiating a long-term
        aggressive therapy. The antimicrobial treatment lasts from 6 months to a year.
        Prognosis is very good. The role of IUD as a factor in the dissemination of
        the infection is very important. Physicians should be aware of actinomycosis

        gastrocnemius muscle biopsy as a tool in the histologic confirmation of the
        diagnosis of sarcoidosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTwenty-two patients admitted over
        a 2-year period to our department with bilateral hilar adenopathy and a variety
        of symptoms compatible with sarcoidosis were studied prospectively. Besides
        a complete history and physical, serum angiotensin converting enzyme (SACE)
        determination, pulmonary function, slit lamp eye examination, PPD skin test,
        gallium 67 scan and gastrocnemius muscle biopsy were performed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe
        biopsy revealed non-caseating granuloma in all patients, confirming the diagnosis
        of sarcoidosis. No other patient in our department received this diagnosis
        over the 2-year period of the study. The procedure was well tolerated by all
        patients and almost zero morbidity was noted. Erythema nodosum was present
        in 68.2% of the patients, PPD was negative in all of them, SACE was elevated
        in 59.1% and pulmonary function was normal in the majority.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe
        impressive sensitivity of asymptomatic gastrocnemius muscle biopsy, its safety
        and ease of performance, along with the extreme rarity of muscle involvement
        by other granulomatous diseases included in the differential diagnosis, may
        render it the procedure of choice for the histologic confirmation of sarcoidosis
        presenting with hilar adenopathy.", "venue": "Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology",

        etiology of gastric cancer was undertaken in Piraeus, the sister city of Athens,
        in a population characterized by ethnic homogeneity but substantial heterogeneity
        with respect to dietary habits. The case series consisted of 110 consecutive
        patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach, admitted
        to two teaching hospitals during a 3\u2010year period; the control series
        consisted of orthopedic patients admitted to a nearby hospital for accidents,
        fractures and other orthopedic disorders, during the same time period. Dietary
        histories concerning the frequency of consumption (per month or per week)
        of about 80 food items were obtained by the same interviewer. Cases reported
        significantly less frequent consumption of lemons, oranges, brown bread, and
        raw, salad\u2010type vegetables (particularly lettuce, onions and cucumbers)
        and, independently, significantly more frequent consumption of pasta, beans
        and nuts. A relative risk of about 40 was found between extreme quintiles
        when the above 9 food Items were combined in a linear risk score. Use of an
        index constructed from the study material will clearly overestimate the level
        of risk between the extreme quintiles, but nevertheless the risk differences
        appear noteworthy, and consistent with the international variation in the
        incidence of gastric cancer. No significant associations were found with alcoholic
        beverages, coffee or tea.", "venue": "International Journal of Cancer", "year":

        of Athens during an 18-month period, and in 206 controls hospitalized during
        the same period with diagnoses other than cancer, and disorders of liver or
        pancreas. Trace elements (Cu, Zn, Mg) were determined in all cancer cases
        and in 63 controls by the Perkin-Elmer model 306 atomic absorption spectrophotometer.
        The main findings were as follows: Cancer of the pancreas was associated with
        cigarette smoking (relative risk 2.7; P less than 0.05), diabetes mellitus
        (relative risk 2.1; P less than 0.05), and cholelithiasis (relative risk 3.5;
        P less than 0.05), but not with alcohol drinking (relative risk 0.7; P less
        than 0.20) and some other variables. There was a statistically significant
        increase of serum copper in patients suffering from pancreatic cancer in comparison
        with noncancer hospital controls. No consistent differences were found with
        respect to zinc and magnesium.", "venue": "Cancer Detection and Prevention",

        were re-tested in the presence of proteins (Tryptone Soya Broth and fresh
        human plasma consecutively) the antiphage activity was abofished, probably
        due to the inactivation of the active compounds by proteins.", "venue": "",

        by using key words such as oncologic board, medical legislation and medical
        ethics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCurrent mentality suggests that hiding the truth from
        the patient is wrong and unethical. However, in the Greek society, this is
        not the case as it seems not right to adopt foreign practices, i.e. to disclose
        directly to the patient all information relevant to his health status, the
        intended therapy and possible outcome. Instead, ambiguous information pass
        onto relatives who in turn bear the burden of informing the patient.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe
        best solution would be the integration of the positive elements of the patient''s
        awareness and the beneficial effects of the involvement of the Greek family
        in the general care of the cancer patient.", "venue": "Journal of B.U.ON.

        "The problem of continual learning in the domain of reinforcement learning,
        often called non-stationary reinforcement learning, has been identified as
        an important challenge to the application of reinforcement learning. We prove
        a worst-case complexity result, which we believe captures this challenge:
        Modifying the probabilities or the reward of a single state-action pair in
        a reinforcement learning problem requires an amount of time almost as large
        as the number of states in order to keep the value function up to date, unless
        the strong exponential time hypothesis (SETH) is false; SETH is a widely accepted
        strengthening of the P $\\neq$ NP conjecture. Recall that the number of states
        in current applications of reinforcement learning is typically astronomical.
        In contrast, we show that just $\\textit{adding}$ a new state-action pair
        is considerably easier to implement.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2023,

        becomes a problem in the theory of dynamical systems. We apply this theory,

        any dynamics is bound to have starting points that do not end up at a Nash
        equilibrium. We also prove a stronger result for $\\epsilon$-approximate Nash
        equilibria: there are games such that no game dynamics can converge (in an
        appropriate sense) to $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria, and in fact the set of
        such games has positive measure. Further numerical results demonstrate that
        this holds for any $\\epsilon$ between zero and $0.09$. Our results establish

        with PARP inhibitors (PARPis), which are now approved for the treatment of
        ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers. The BRCA1/2 genes and mutations
        in many additional genes involved in the HR pathway may be responsible for
        the HRD phenomenon. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association
        between genomic loss of heterozygosity (gLOH) and alterations in 513 genes
        with targeted and immuno-oncology therapies in 406 samples using an NGS assay.
        In addition, the %gLOHs of 24 samples were calculated using the Affymetrix
        technology in order to compare the results obtained via the two methodologies.
        HR variations occurred in 20.93% of the malignancies, while BRCA1/2 gene alterations
        occurred in 5.17% of the malignancies. The %LOH was highly correlated with
        alterations in the BRCA1/2 genes, since 76.19% (16/21) of the BRCA1/2 positive
        tumors had a high %LOH value (p = 0.007). Moreover, the LOH status was highly
        correlated with the TP53 and KRAS statuses, but there was no association with
        the TMB value. Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient for the 24 samples
        simultaneously examined via both assays was 0.87, indicating a nearly perfect
        agreement. In conclusion, the addition of gLOH analysis could assist in the
        detection of additional patients eligible for treatment with PARPis.", "venue":

        deficiency (HRD) are considered optimal candidates for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
        1 (PARP) inhibitor treatment. Such deficiency can be detected by analyzing
        breast cancer type (BRCA)1/2 gene mutations, as well as mutations in other
        genes of the homologous recombination pathway. The algorithmic measurement
        of the HRD effect by identifying genomic instability (GI) has been used as
        biomarker. As compared with the direct measurement of somatic gene alterations,
        this approach increases the number of patients who could benefit from PARP
        inhibitor treatment. In the present study, the performance of the Oncoscan
        CNV assay, accompanied by appropriate bioinformatic algorithms, was evaluated
        for its performance in GI calculation and was compared with that of a validated
        next-generation sequencing (NGS) test (myChoice HRD test). In addition, the
        clinical utility of the GI score (GIS) and BRCA1/2 tumor analysis were investigated
        in a cohort of 444 patients with ovarian cancer. For that reason, single nucleotide
        polymorphism (SNP) arrays and appropriate bioinformatics algorithms were used
        to calculate GIS in 29 patients with ovarian cancer with known GIS status
        using a validated NGS test. Furthermore, BRCA1/2 analysis results were compared
        between the aforementioned assay and the amplicon-based Oncomine\u2122 BRCA
        Research Assay. BRCA1/2 analysis was performed in 444 patients with ovarian
        cancer, while GIS was calculated in 175 BRCA1/2-negative cases. The bioinformatics
        algorithm developed for GIS calculation in combination with NGS BRCA1/2 analysis
        (RediScore), and the OncoscanR pipeline exhibited a high overall agreement
        with the validated test (93.1%). In addition, the Oncomine NGS assay had a
        100% agreement with the validated test. The BRCA1/2 mutation frequency was
        26.5% in the examined patients with ovarian cancer. GIS was positive in 40%
        of the BRCA1/2-negative cases. The RediScore bioinformatics algorithm developed
        for GIS calculation in combination with NGS BRCA1/2 analysis is a viable and
        effective approach for HRD calculation in patients with ovarian cancer, offering
        a positive prediction for PARP inhibitor responsiveness in 55% of the patients.",

        CAD-program inom produkttillverkning och produktutveckling \nkraver maximal
        noggrannhet i matdata. Teknologin tar jamna steg mot en programutveckling
        \nsom blir alltmer komplex och kan i vissa fall upplevas som komplicerad och
        mer \nproblematisk. Man behover daremot inte stora kunskaper om CAD-anvandning
        for att forsta \natt en mer kontrollerad och strukturerad CAD-samordning som
        samordnar all CAD-relaterad \ninformation efter rutiner och krav bidrar till
        tidsbesparingar. Alla projektorer arbetar darefter \nmed korrekta och enhetliga
        handlingar vid varje given tidpunkt. En del av de ritningar som \nanvands
        idag finns enbart i pappersformat, en del i enklare CAD-format eller sa finns
        inga \nritningar alls. CAD-samordning inom byggbranschen kommer darfor att
        vara minst lika viktig \noch nodvandig i framtiden som den ar idag. \nDe flesta
        byggprojekt gors idag med 2D- och/eller 3D-teknik. Fastighetsagare/forvaltare
        har \ninsett hur viktigt det ar med CAD-samordning och anvandandet av en CAD-kravspecifikation.
        \nDet kravs darfor en klar gemensam malbild hos alla inblandade och intresserade
        parter inom \nbyggbranschen. \nSamtidigt som programmen kan tankas bli mer
        informationsbarande med tiden, har vissa \nbyggprojekt borjat ta stora steg
        fran vanlig CAD-projektering till BIM\u2013projektering. \nProblemet ar inte
        hur man ska tillampa och anvanda dessa framtida projekteringsprogram, \nutan
        mer pa hur man ska samordna den digitala informationen. BIM ar ett satt att
        hantera \nobjektorienterad information pa ett mer koncentrerat och kontrollerat
        satt. Sarskilt nar man \nanvander sig av parametrisk modellering. Nar andringar

        medfor att alla aktorer som medverkar och \nberors av sarskilda andringar
        alltid bor ha riktiga och uppdaterade handlingar. En CADsamordnare \nsom utvecklar
        och skaffar sig tidig erfarenhet kring denna arbetsprocess borde \nklarar
        av att samordna information som standigt uppdateras. \nFor manga projektorer
        ar BIM relativt nytt men de ar valdigt positiva och oppna for nya \nprojekteringssatt.
        Det ser ut som om CAD-samordnaren i framtiden kommer att kallas for \n\u201dBIM-samordnare\u201d,

        och kostnadsrakning, vilket \nkan undvikas da denna information kan tas fram
        med hjalp av 4D- och 5D-modellering. \nBestallaren far en oversikt over hur
        mycket bygget kommer att kosta och hur mycket tid varje \nbyggdel kommer att
        krava redan under projekteringsskedet. Entreprenorer kan gora \nmangdberakningar
        och utforma sina materiallistor. Entreprenorer vill aven lagga fokus pa att
        \nbestalla och hantera 3D-projektering, samordning i 3D och kalkyl i 3D. Pa
        sa satt kan \nentreprenorer uppna hogre engagemang, okad produktivitet och
        farre revideringar. \nForvaltarna kan fa ut stora fortjanster med att fa in
        ritningar och handlingar av god kvalite \nsom de kan anvanda sig av under
        hela byggnadens livscykel. De kan spara pengar och tid da \nde slipper bekosta
        sig for efterbearbete. De har dessutom mojlighet att med hjalp av ratt \ninformation
        i modellerna, snabbare hamta den information som en hyresgast eller kund \nbehover,
        vilket ger flera nojda kunder. \nAtt andra pa arbetssattet som man ar van
        vid ar aldrig latt och att forespraka for BIM ar ett \nstort steg for vissa

        \nstora projekt bor darfor goras med 4D- eller 5D-teknik. Renodlad BIM-projektering

        The Nash equilibrium is the fundamental solution concept of game theory, playing
        a central role in fields beyond economics. Nash\u2019s existence proof is
        famously nonconstructive, and the dynamics employed in the proof fail to converge
        to a Nash equilibrium. We show that this failure is a special case of a much
        more sweeping impossibility result for any game dynamics satisfying a minimal
        set of desiderata. Thus, the solution concept of Nash equilibria, while universally
        applicable, is also simultaneously a fundamentally incomplete description
        of the possible long-term agent behavior.", "venue": "Proceedings of the National

        kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: clinical
        and molecular considerations.", "abstract": "Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
        with somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is anticipated
        to respond to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) of the EGFR
        tyrosine kinase. There are, however, patients with EGFR mutated tumors who
        do not demonstrate tumor response. The most widely accepted mechanism of ''de
        novo'' (inherent) resistance to these TKIs involves mutations of the KRAS
        gene. KRAS is a downstream mediator of EGFR-induced cell signaling, such mutations
        appear to be mutually exclusive from EGFR mutations in lung cancer. The first
        molecular modifier of resistance identified in patients who developed resistance
        (termed ''acquired resistance'') to TK inhibition was a new acquired somatic
        EGFR mutation (T790M). Today there is an ever-growing series of molecular
        events that have recently come to the forefront to explain other instances
        of TKI resistance not attributable to T790M or KRAS. These include a number
        of molecules that interact with EGFR or form part of its downstream signaling
        pathway such as HER-2, IGFR-1, MET and B-RAF. Considering that the majority
        of studies carried out to date with respect to the identification of resistant
        clones have not used highly sensitive techniques (e.g. allelic discrimination
        to identify somatic mutations), coupled with the relatively low number of
        studies examining multiple molecular markers and the accepted molecular heterogeneity
        of NSCLC raise question as to the existence of ''acquired'' versus ''de-novo''
        resistance. By examining the current knowledge base with respect to mechanisms
        of resistance to EGFR TKIs in NSCLC, we explore whether ''acquired'' resistance
        is ''de-novo'' resistance in disguise, and discuss the promises and limitations
        of molecular stratification with respect to strategies incorporating TKIs
        in the treatment of NSCLC.", "venue": "Current Medicinal Chemistry", "year":
