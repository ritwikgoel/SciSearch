        truly accessible and inclusive society, we need to take the more than 2.2
        billion people with vision impairments worldwide into account when we design
        our cities, buildings, and everyday objects. This requires sympathy and empathy,
        as well as a certain level of understanding of the impact of vision impairments
        on perception. In this study, we explore the potential of an extended version
        of our vision-impairment simulation system XREye to increase sympathy and
        empathy and evaluate its educational value in an expert study with 56 educators
        and education students. We include data from a previous study in related work
        on sympathy and empathy as a baseline for comparison with our data. Our results
        show increased sympathy and empathy after experiencing XREye and positive
        feedback regarding its educational value. Hence, we believe that vision-impairment
        simulations, such as XREye, have merit to be used for educational purposes
        in order to increase awareness for the challenges people with vision impairments
        face in their everyday lives.", "venue": "Multimodal Technologies and Interaction",

        problem. In this article, we present a set of algorithms to mitigate VR sickness
        that dynamically modulate the user''s field of view by modifying the contrast
        of the periphery based on movement, color, and depth. In contrast with previous
        work, this vision modulator is a shader that is triggered by specific motions
        known to cause VR sickness, such as acceleration, strafing, and linear velocity.
        Moreover, the algorithm is governed by delta velocity, delta angle, and average
        color of the view. We ran two experiments with different washout periods to
        investigate the effectiveness of dynamic modulation on the symptoms of VR
        sickness, in which we compared this approach against a baseline and pitch-black
        field-of-view restrictors. Our first experiment made use of a just-noticeable-sickness

        "title": "Precueing Sequential Rotation Tasks in Augmented Reality", "abstract":
        "Augmented reality has been used to improve sequential-task performance by
        cueing information about a current task step and precueing information about
        future steps. Existing work has shown the benefits of precueing movement (translation)
        information. However, rotation is also a major component in many real-life
        tasks, such as turning knobs to adjust parameters on a console. We developed
        an AR testbed to investigate whether and how much precued rotation information
        can improve user performance. We consider two unimanual tasks: one requires
        a user to make sequential rotations of a single object, and the other requires
        the user to move their hand between multiple objects to rotate them in sequence.
        We conducted a user study to explore these two tasks using circular arrows
        to communicate rotation. In the single-object task, we examined the impact
        of number of precues and visualization style on user performance. Results
        show that precues improved performance and that arrows with highlighted heads
        and tails, with each destination aligned with the next origin, yielded the
        shortest completion time on average. In the multiple-object task, we explored
        whether rotation precues can be helpful in conjunction with movement precues.
        Here, using a rotation cue without rotation precues in conjunction with a
        movement cue and movement precues performed the best, implying that rotation
        precues were not helpful when movement was also required.", "venue": "Virtual

        Reality", "abstract": "Work on cueing performance in AR and VR has focused
        on sequential tasks in which each step must be completed in order before the
        user can proceed to the next. However, for unordered tasks such as putting
        books back on a library shelf, the user may be able to perform multiple steps
        concurrently without needing to follow a specific order. In such situations,
        giving the user multiple cues for potentially concurrent steps may improve
        performance time. To investigate this, we built a bimanual VR testbed in which
        the user needs to move objects to designated destinations, guided by different
        numbers of cues. The user can decide the order to perform the cued steps and,
        in some conditions, can affect which cues are shown.In a formal user study,
        we found that in most conditions, participants perform fastest with three
        cues. Dynamically updating the set of displayed cues based on hand proximity
        improves performance, and updating the set based on eye gaze improves performance
        even more. Finally, for both the hand-proximity and eye-gaze mechanisms, performance
        can be further improved by locking the cues for objects predicted to be moved
        next based on hand distance.", "venue": "International Symposium on Mixed

        Tasks in Virtual Reality", "abstract": "Work on VR and AR task interaction
        and visualization paradigms has typically focused on providing information
        about the current step (a cue) immediately before or during its performance.
        Some research has also shown benefits to simultaneously providing information
        about the next step (a precue). We explore whether it would be possible to
        improve efficiency by precueing information about multiple upcoming steps
        before completing the current step. To accomplish this, we developed a remote
        VR user study comparing task completion time and subjective metrics for different
        levels and styles of precueing in a path-following task. Our visualizations
        vary the precueing level (number of steps precued in advance) and style (whether
        the path to a target is communicated through a line to the target, and whether
        the place of a target is communicated through graphics at the target). Participants
        in our study performed best when given two to three precues for visualizations
        using lines to show the path to targets. However, performance degraded when
        four precues were used. On the other hand, participants performed best with
        only one precue for visualizations without lines, showing only the places
        of targets, and performance degraded when a second precue was given. In addition,
        participants performed better using visualizations with lines than ones without

        "abstract": "Studies in robot teleoperation have been centered around action
        specifications-from continuous joint control to discrete end-effector pose
        control. However, these \u201crobot-centric\u201d interfaces often require
        skilled operators with extensive robotics expertise. To make teleoperation
        accessible to nonexpert users, we propose the framework \u201cScene Editing
        as Teleoperation\u201d (SEaT), where the key idea is to transform the traditional
        \u201crobot-centric\u201d interface into a \u201cscene-centric\u201d interface-instead
        of controlling the robot, users focus on specifying the task''s goal by manipulating
        digital twins of the real-world objects. As a result, a user can perform teleoperation
        without any expert knowledge of the robot hardware. To achieve this goal,
        we utilize a category-agnostic scene-completion algorithm that translates
        the real-world workspace (with unknown objects) into a manipulable virtual
        scene representation and an action-snapping algorithm that refines the user
        input before generating the robot''s action plan. To train the algorithms,
        we procedurely generated a large-scale, diverse kit-assembly dataset that
        contains object-kit pairs that mimic real-world object-kitting tasks. Our
        experiments in simulation and on a real-world system demonstrate that our
        framework improves both the efficiency and success rate for 6DoF kit-assembly
        tasks. A user study demonstrates that SEaT framework participants achieve
        a higher task success rate and report a lower subjective workload compared
        to an alternative robot-centric interface.", "venue": "IEEE/RJS International

        "Musicians face a number of issues when performing live, including organizing
        and annotating sheet music. This can be an unwieldy process, as musicians
        need to simultaneously read and manipulate sheet music and interact with the
        conductor and other musicians. Augmented Reality can provide a way to ease
        some of the more cumbersome aspects of live performance and practice. We present
        MiXR, a novel interactive system that combines an AR headset, a smartphone,
        and a tablet to allow performers to intuitively and efficiently manage and
        annotate virtual sheet music in their physical environment. We discuss our
        underlying motivation, the interaction techniques supported, and the system
        architecture.", "venue": "2020 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented

        a Hands-Free Approach and a Manual Approach", "abstract": "Many AR and VR
        task domains involve manipulating virtual objects; for example, to perform
        3D geometric transformations. These operations are typically accomplished
        with tracked hands or hand-held controllers. However, there are some activities
        in which the user''s hands are already busy with another task, requiring the
        user to temporarily stop what they are doing to perform the second task, while
        also taking time to disengage and reengage with the original task (e.g., putting
        down and picking up tools). To avoid the need to overload the user''s hands
        this way in an AR system for guiding a physician performing a surgical procedure,
        we developed a hands-free approach to performing 3D transformations on patient-specific
        virtual organ models. Our approach uses small head motions to accomplish first-order
        and zero-order control, in conjunction with voice commands to establish the
        type of transformation. To show the effectiveness of this approach for translating,
        scaling, and rotating 3D virtual models, we conducted a within-subject study
        comparing the hands-free approach with one based on conventional manual techniques,
        both running on a Microsoft HoloLens and using the same voice commands to
        specify transformation type. Independent of any additional time to transition
        between tasks, users were significantly faster overall using the hands-free
        approach, significantly faster for hands-free translation and scaling, and
        faster (although not significantly) for hands-free rotation.", "venue": "International

        displays have a relatively narrow field of view. However, a limited field
        of view can constrain how information can be presented and searched through.
        To understand these constraints, we present a series of experiments that address
        the interrelationships between field of view, information density, and search
        performance. We do so by simulating various fields of view using two approaches:
        limiting the field of view presented on a Microsoft HoloLens optical-see-through
        head-worn display and dynamically changing the portion of a large tiled-display
        wall on which information is presented, for head-tracked users in both cases.
        Our results indicate a significant effect of information density and field
        of view on search performance, with potential search performance benefits
        of using a larger FOV between ca. 7-28%. Furthermore, while grids guided visual
        search, they did not significantly affect performance.", "venue": "IEEE Conference

        AR platform and smartglasses, considering the different characteristics of
        these platforms. For projection-based AR, we designed visual highlights that
        are projected directly on the stairs. In contrast, for smartglasses that have
        a limited vertical field of view, we designed visualizations that indicate
        the user''s position on the stairs, without directly augmenting the stairs
        themselves. We evaluated our visualizations on each platform with 12 people

        "Vision impairments, such as cataracts, affect the way many people interact
        with their environment, yet are rarely considered by architects and lighting
        designers because of a lack of design tools. To address this, we present a
        method to simulate vision impairments, in particular cataracts, graphically
        in virtual reality (VR), using eye tracking for gaze-dependent effects. We
        also conduct a VR user study to investigate the effects of lighting on visual
        perception for users with cataracts. In contrast to existing approaches, which
        mostly provide only simplified simulations and are primarily targeted at educational
        or demonstrative purposes, we account for the user''s vision and the hardware
        constraints of the VR headset. This makes it possible to calibrate our cataract
        simulation to the same level of degraded vision for all participants. Our
        study results show that we are able to calibrate the vision of all our participants
        to a similar level of impairment, that maximum recognition distances for escape
        route signs with simulated cataracts are significantly smaller than without,
        and that luminaires visible in the field of view are perceived as especially
        disturbing due to the glare effects they create. In addition, the results
        show that our realistic simulation increases the understanding of how people
        with cataracts see and could therefore also be informative for health care
        personnel or relatives of cataract patients.", "venue": "IEEE Conference on

        "title": "SIGCHI Lifetime Research Award Talk-Seeing Past Looking Forward",
        "abstract": "I have long been interested in how computers can help people
        perform skilled tasks-a theme that underlies essentially all of my research.
        As the intentionally convoluted title of this talk implies, I will take a
        look back at some of this research to explain what came later, and to speculate
        on what might be next. My earliest work as a graduate student was as part
        of a team developing novel hypermedia editing and presentation tools for technical
        documentation of equipment maintenance procedures. Understanding the effort
        involved in using these tools manually led to my dissertation, which explored
        rule-based techniques for the automated generation of 3D graphics that could
        ultimately replace the pictures found in maintenance manuals. Based on information
        about the task to be depicted, I designed a system that chose the objects
        to include, determined the level of detail at which to render them (e.g.,
        adding more detail to disambiguate objects that could otherwise be confused
        with each other), highlighted important objects for emphasis, and created
        additional \"metaobjects\" (e.g., arrows to show actions). When I started
        as a faculty member, several of my students built on this research direction
        in both 3D and 2D domains, and we were soon collaborating with colleagues
        to develop generation approaches for coordinated multimedia explanations that
        combined graphics with text. At the same time, I was becoming excited by the
        potential of virtual reality (VR) to render objects stereoscopically and interact
        with them in 3D, in abstract domains as well as physical ones. And it was
        an easy jump from there to augmented reality (AR), cobbling together a simple
        monoscopic optical seethrough head-worn display. Our first AR system was a
        \"hybrid\" desktop window manager that embedded windows displayed on a flat
        panel display within a much larger virtual surround presented on the AR display.
        With that AR display now available as a tool, it became stunningly clear that
        so much of the effort we''d put into carefully crafting stand-alone pictures
        to explain tasks was unnecessary. If the user could instead look directly
        at the actual task domain, then a simple highlight or arrow, overlaid in situ,
        could show which button to push or knob to turn on a panel of controls.",

        "abstract": "Map users often need to interact repetitively with multiple important
        locations. For example, a traveler may frequently check her hotel or a train
        station on a map, use them to localize an unknown location, or investigate
        routes involving them. Ironically, these location-centric tasks cannot be
        performed using locations directly; users must instead pan and zoom the map
        or use a menu to access locations. We propose SpaceTokens, interactive widgets
        that act as clones of locations, and which users can create and place on map
        edges like virtual whiteboard magnets. SpaceTokens make location a first-class
        citizen of map interaction. They empower users to rapidly perform location-centric
        tasks directly using locations: users can select combinations of on-screen
        locations and SpaceTokens to control the map window, or connect them to create
        routes. Participants in a study overwhelmingly preferred a SpaceTokens prototype
        over Google Maps on identical smartphones for the majority of tasks.", "venue":

        "abstract": "Abstract Background\u2003Health care organizations increasingly
        use patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to capture patients'' health status.
        Although federal policy mandates PRO collection, the challenge remains to
        better engage patients in PRO surveys, and ensure patients comprehend the
        surveys and their results. Objective\u2003This article identifies the design
        requirements for an interface that assists patients with PRO survey completion
        and interpretation, and then builds and evaluates the interface. Methods\u2003We
        employed a user-centered design process that consisted of three stages. First,
        we conducted qualitative interviews and surveys with 13 patients and 11 health
        care providers to understand their perceptions of the value and challenges
        associated with the use of PRO measures. Second, we used the results to identify
        design requirements for an interface that collects PROs, and designed the
        interface. Third, we conducted usability testing with 12 additional patients
        in a hospital setting. Results\u2003In interviews, patients and providers
        reported that PRO surveys help patients to reflect on their symptoms, potentially
        identifying new opportunities for improved care. However, 6 out of 13 patients
        reported significant difficultly in understanding PRO survey questions, answer
        choices and results. Therefore, we identified aiding comprehension as a key
        design requirement, and incorporated visualizations into our interface design
        to aid comprehension. In usability testing, patients found the interface highly
        usable. Conclusion\u2003Future interfaces designed to collect PROs may benefit
        from employing strategies such as visualization to aid comprehension and engage
        patients with surveys.", "venue": "Applied Clinical Informatics", "year":

        "In collaborative virtual environments, users must often perform tasks requiring
        coordinated action between multiple parties. Some cases are symmetric, in
        which users work together on equal footing, while others are asymmetric, in
        which one user may have more experience or capabilities than another (e.g.,
        one may guide another in completing a task). We present a multi-user virtual
        reality system that supports interactions of both these types. Two collaborating
        users, whether co-located or remote, simultaneously manipulate the same virtual
        objects in a physics simulation, in tasks that require low latency networking
        to perform successfully. We are currently applying this approach to motor

        "title": "Mercury: A Messaging Framework for Modular UI Components", "abstract":
        "In recent years, the entity--component--system pattern has become a fundamental
        feature of the software architectures of game-development environments such
        as Unity and Unreal, which are used extensively in developing 3D user interfaces.
        In these systems, UI components typically respond to events, requiring programmers
        to write application-specific callback functions. In some cases, components
        are organized in a hierarchy that is used to propagate events among vertically
        connected components. When components need to communicate horizontally, programmers
        must connect those components manually and register/unregister events as needed.
        Moreover, events and callback signatures may be incompatible, making modular
        UIs cumbersome to build and share within or across applications. To address
        these problems, we introduce a messaging framework, Mercury, to facilitate
        communication among components. We provide an overview of Mercury, outline
        its underlying protocol and how it propagates messages to responders using
        relay nodes, describe a reference implementation in Unity, and present example
        systems built using Mercury to explain its advantages.", "venue": "International

        "In many complex tasks, a remote subject-matter expert may need to assist

        However, effective spatial referencing and action demonstration in a remote
        physical environment can be challenging. We demonstrate an approach that uses
        Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) for the remote expert, and
        AR for the local user, each wearing a stereo head-worn display (HWD). Our
        approach allows the remote expert to create and manipulate virtual replicas
        of physical objects in the local environment to refer to parts of those physical
        objects and to indicate actions on them. This can be especially useful for
        parts that are occluded or difficult to access. The remote expert can demonstrate
        actions in 3D by manipulating virtual replicas, supported by constraints and
        annotations, and point in 3D to portions of virtual replicas to annotate them.",

        study with cardiothoracic surgery patients", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nPrior
        studies of computing applications that support patients'' medication knowledge
        and self-management offer valuable insights into effective application design,
        but do not address inpatient settings. This study is the first to explore
        the design and usefulness of patient-facing tools supporting inpatient medication
        management and tracking.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nWe designed myNYP Inpatient,
        a custom personal health record application, through an iterative, user-centered
        approach. Medication-tracking tools in myNYP Inpatient include interactive
        views of home and hospital medication data and features for commenting on
        these data. In a two-phase pilot study, patients used the tools during cardiothoracic
        postoperative care at Columbia University Medical Center. In Phase One, we
        provided 20 patients with the application for 24-48 h and conducted a closing
        interview after this period. In Phase Two, we conducted semi-structured interviews
        with 12 patients and 5 clinical pharmacists who evaluated refinements to the
        tools based on the feedback received during Phase One.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPatients
        reported that the medication-tracking tools were useful. During Phase One,
        14 of the 20 participants used the tools actively, to review medication lists
        and log comments and questions about their medications. Patients'' interview
        responses and audit logs revealed that they made frequent use of the hospital
        medications feature and found electronic reporting of questions and comments
        useful. We also uncovered important considerations for subsequent design of
        such tools. In Phase Two, the patients and pharmacists participating in the
        study confirmed the usability and usefulness of the refined tools.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInpatient
        medication-tracking tools, when designed to meet patients'' needs, can play
        an important role in fostering patient participation in their own care and
        patient-provider communication during a hospital stay.", "venue": "J. Am.

        may exist outside the map or on a background with no meaningful cues. To address
        this issue, we present Personalized Compass, a self-contained compact graphical
        location indicator. Personalized Compass uses personal a priori POIs to establish
        a reference frame, within which a POI in question can then be localized. Graphically,
        a personalized compass combines a multi-needle compass with an abstract overview
        map. We analyze the characteristics of Personalized Compass and the existing
        Wedge technique, and report on a user study comparing them. Personalized Compass
        performs better for four inference tasks, while Wedge is better for a locating
        task. Based on our analysis and study results, we suggest the two techniques
        are complementary and offer design recommendations.", "venue": "International

        "title": "A framework to facilitate reusable, modular widget design for real-time
        interactive systems", "abstract": "Game engines have become popular development
        platforms for real-time interactive systems. Contemporary game engines, such
        as Unity and Unreal, feature component-based architectures, in which an object''s
        appearance and behavior is determined by a collection of component scripts
        added to that object. This design pattern allows common functionality to be
        contained within component scripts and shared among different types of objects.
        In this paper, we describe a flexible framework that enables programmers to
        design modular, reusable widgets for real-time interactive systems using a
        collection of component scripts. We provide a reference implementation written
        in C# for the Unity game engine. Making an object, or a group of objects,
        part of our managed widget framework can be accomplished with just a few drag-and-drop
        operations in the Unity Editor. While our framework provides hooks and default
        implementations for common widget behavior (e.g., initialization, refresh,
        and toggling visibility), programmers can also define custom behavior for
        a particular widget or combine simple widgets into a hierarchy and build arbitrarily
        rich ones. Finally, we provide an overview of an accompanying library of scripts
        that support functionality for testing and networking.", "venue": "Workshop

        "Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) have been explored by researchers
        for nearly a half century. Over the past few years, however, VR has experienced
        a renaissance, as head-worn display developer kits have metamorphosed into
        early consumer products, all far superior to what most VR researchers previously
        had available. Meanwhile, AR head-worn display developer kits are being released,
        even as Pok\u00e9mon Go has caused public awareness of hand-held AR to skyrocket.
        What role will wireless computing play in the future of wearable VR and AR
        systems? I will suggest some of the ways in which future wearable hardware,
        software, and user interfaces could benefit from wireless technology, and
        describe some of the performance constraints that wireless systems must meet
        for this to be possible. For example, in the quest to develop lightweight
        eyewear, it will be advantageous to move as much technology as possible off
        the head, to other parts of the body or to the nearby environment. This will
        demand reliably low latency and high throughput for the asymmetric round trip
        from head-worn sensors, to off-head processors, back to head-worn displays.
        Furthermore, when AR eyewear becomes commonplace, so will multi-user AR collaboration,
        and that means handling intricate interactions between users, both co-located
        and remote.", "venue": "HotWireless@MobiCom", "year": 2016, "referenceCount":

        one object must be oriented relative to a second prior to assembly and tasks
        in which objects must be held in specific ways to inspect them. Research has
        investigated guidance mechanisms for some 6DOF tasks, using wide--field-of-view,
        stereoscopic virtual and augmented reality head-worn displays (HWDs). However,
        there has been relatively little work directed toward smaller field-of-view
        lightweight monoscopic HWDs, such as Google Glass, which may remain more comfortable
        and less intrusive than stereoscopic HWDs in the near future. We have designed
        and implemented a novel visualization approach and three additional visualizations
        representing different paradigms for guiding unconstrained manual 3DOF rotation,

        an inpatient personal health record (PHR) on a tablet computer to increase
        engagement in their hospital care. Methods We performed observations and conducted
        semi-structured interviews with 14 post-operative cardiac surgical patients
        and their family members who received an inpatient PHR. Themes were identified
        using an inductive coding scheme. Results All participants responded favorably
        to having access to view their clinical information. A majority (85.7%) of
        participants used the application following an initial training session. Patients
        reported high satisfaction with being able to view their hospital medications
        and access educational materials related to their medical conditions. Patients
        reported a desire to view daily progress reports about their hospital stay
        and have access to educational information about their postacute recovery.
        In addition, patients expressed a common desire to view their diagnoses, laboratory
        test results, radiology reports, and procedure notes in language that is patient-friendly.
        Conclusion Patients have unmet information needs in the hospital setting.
        Our findings suggest that for some inpatients and their family members, providing

        "title": "Combating VR sickness through subtle dynamic field-of-view modification",
        "abstract": "Virtual Reality (VR) sickness can cause intense discomfort, shorten
        the duration of a VR experience, and create an aversion to further use of
        VR. High-quality tracking systems can minimize the mismatch between a user''s
        visual perception of the virtual environment (VE) and the response of their
        vestibular system, diminishing VR sickness for moving users. However, this
        does not help users who do not or cannot move physically the way they move
        virtually, because of preference or physical limitations such as a disability.
        It has been noted that decreasing field of view (FOV) tends to decrease VR
        sickness, though at the expense of sense of presence. To address this tradeoff,
        we explore the effect of dynamically, yet subtly, changing a physically stationary
        person''s FOV in response to visually perceived motion as they virtually traverse
        a VE. We report the results of a two-session, multi-day study with 30 participants.
        Each participant was seated in a stationary chair, wearing a stereoscopic
        head-worn display, and used control and FOV-modifying conditions in the same
        VE. Our data suggests that by strategically and automatically manipulating
        FOV during a VR session, we can reduce the degree of VR sickness perceived
        by participants and help them adapt to VR, without decreasing their subjective
        level of presence, and minimizing their awareness of the intervention.", "venue":

        "title": "Collaboration in Mediated and Augmented Reality (CiMAR) Summary",
        "abstract": "Summary form only given. The world is becoming more complex everyday,
        so problem solving often requires global teams of experts working together.
        To do this effectively there is a need for collaborative tools, and so a variety
        of teleconferencing and telepresence technologies have been developed. However,
        most of them involve some variation of traditional video conferencing, which
        has limitations, such as not being able to effectively convey spatial cues.
        This workshop focuses on how Augmented Reality (AR) [1] and Mediated Reality
        (MR) [2] technology can be used to overcome these limitations and develop
        radically new types of collaborative experiences. In combination, AR and MR
        technologies could be used to merge the shared perceived realities of different
        users, as well as enrich each user''s own individual experience in a collaborative
        task. Several studies have explored the effectiveness of using AR and MR for
        complex tasks. For example, AR has been shown to improve the effectiveness
        of individual manual assembly tasks [3], while MR systems have been shown
        to improve the performance time and mental effort in collaborative design
        tasks [4]. Recent research on using MR for collaboration among crime scene
        investigators indicates that using shared visual feedback promotes mutual
        understanding, leads to consensus, and supports hypothesis testing [5]. There
        are many examples of collaborative AR applications. The Studierstube system
        [6] targets face-to-face presentations and allows users to walk around virtual
        3D scientific data. WearCom [7] enables users to see remote users as virtual
        avatars in real space. Ho\u0308llerer et al. [8] allow indoor AR users to
        visualize the locations and paths of outdoor AR users, and all users to create
        shared annotations. Poelman et al. [5] present an AR system that allows remote
        experts to collaborate with local investigators on a crime scene investigation
        in order to secure evidence. Datcu et al. [9] present an AR system that supports
        the distributed situational awareness of cross-organisational teams in the
        security domain. Gauglitz et al. [10] introduce a tablet-based system that
        incorporates a touchscreen interface through which a remote user can navigate
        a physical environment and create world-aligned annotations for supporting
        remote maintenance. In summary, MR and AR technology is becoming mature enough
        to support a variety of collaboration scenarios. However, there are still
        a number of open issues that need further research. One major issue concerns
        the presence of remote users and how they can interact with the system and
        each other. Partial answers can be found in the areas of human-computer interaction,
        social interaction, affective computing, and task domain analysis. This workshop
        brings together researchers who are developing or interested in creating collaborative
        systems using AR and MR technologies. Starting with a keynote from Prof. Tetsuro
        Ogi from Keio University, Japan, workshop participants will discuss open research
        issues in relation to: Case studies using MR/AR for collaboration; Tools for
        building collaborative MR/AR systems; Effects of MR/AR on trust, presence,
        and coordination; Interaction models for collaboration in MR/AR; Tools for
        collaboration in MR/AR; Collaboration awareness in MR/AR. The goal is to build
        a picture of current and prior research on collaboration in AR and MR, as
        well as set up a common research agenda for work going forward. This, in turn,
        can be used to grow the research community.", "venue": "2015 IEEE International

        Reality", "abstract": "In many complex tasks, a remote subject-matter expert
        may need to assist a local user to guide actions on objects in the local user''s
        environment. However, effective spatial referencing and action demonstration
        in a remote physical environment can be challenging. We introduce two approaches
        that use Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) for the remote expert,
        and AR for the local user, each wearing a stereo head-worn display. Both approaches
        allow the expert to create and manipulate virtual replicas of physical objects
        in the local environment to refer to parts of those physical objects and to
        indicate actions on them. This can be especially useful for parts that are
        occluded or difficult to access. In one approach, the expert points in 3D
        to portions of virtual replicas to annotate them. In another approach, the
        expert demonstrates actions in 3D by manipulating virtual replicas, supported
        by constraints and annotations. We performed a user study of a 6DOF alignment
        task, a key operation in many physical task domains, comparing both approaches
        to an approach in which the expert uses a 2D tablet-based drawing system similar
        to ones developed for prior work on remote assistance. The study showed the
        3D demonstration approach to be faster than the others. In addition, the 3D
        pointing approach was faster than the 2D tablet in the case of a highly trained
        expert.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology",

        "title": "ParaFrustum: visualization techniques for guiding a user to a constrained
        set of viewing positions and orientations", "abstract": "Many tasks in real
        or virtual environments require users to view a target object or location
        from one of a set of strategic viewpoints to see it in context, avoid occlusions,
        or view it at an appropriate angle or distance. We introduce ParaFrustum,
        a geometric construct that represents this set of strategic viewpoints and
        viewing directions. ParaFrustum is inspired by the look-from and look-at points
        of a computer graphics camera specification, which precisely delineate a location
        for the camera and a direction in which it looks. We generalize this approach
        by defining a ParaFrustum in terms of a look-from volume and a look-at volume,
        which establish constraints on a range of acceptable locations for the user''s
        eyes and a range of acceptable angles in which the user''s head can be oriented.
        Providing tolerance in the allowable viewing positions and directions avoids
        burdening the user with the need to assume a tightly constrained 6DoF pose
        when it is not required by the task. We describe two visualization techniques
        for virtual or augmented reality that guide a user to assume one of the poses
        defined by a ParaFrustum, and present the results of a user study measuring
        the performance of these techniques. The study shows that the constraints
        of a tightly constrained ParaFrustum (e.g., approximating a conventional camera
        frustum) require significantly more time to satisfy than those of a loosely
        constrained one. The study also reveals interesting differences in participant
        trajectories in response to the two techniques.", "venue": "ACM Symposium

        for studies that discussed patient engagement (''self-efficacy'', ''patient

        Reality", "abstract": "Goal-oriented visual search is performed when a person
        intentionally seeks a target in the visual environment. In augmented reality
        (AR) environments, visual search can be facilitated by augmenting virtual
        cues in the person''s field of view. Traditional use of explicit AR cues can
        potentially degrade visual search performance due to the creation of distortions
        in the scene. An alternative to explicit cueing, known as subtle cueing, has
        been proposed as a clutter-neutral method to enhance visual search in video-see-through
        AR. However, the effects of subtle cueing are still not well understood, and
        more research is required to determine the optimal methods of applying subtle
        cueing in AR. We performed two experiments to investigate the variables of
        scene clutter, subtle cue opacity, size, and shape on visual search performance.
        We introduce a novel method of experimentally manipulating the scene clutter
        variable in a natural scene while controlling for other variables. The findings
        provide supporting evidence for the subtlety of the cue, and show that the
        clutter conditions of the scene can be used both as a global classifier, as
        well as a local performance measure.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization

        "Recent research focused on online health information seeking highlights a
        heavy reliance on general-purpose search engines. However, current general-purpose
        search interfaces do not necessarily provide adequate support for non-experts
        in identifying suitable sources of health information. Popular search engines
        have recently introduced search tools in their user interfaces for a range
        of topics. In this work, we explore how such tools can support non-expert,
        patient-centered health information search. Scoping the current work to medication-related
        search, we report on findings from a formative study focused on the design
        of patient-centered, medication-information search tools. Our study included
        qualitative interviews with patients, family members, and domain experts,
        as well as observations of their use of Remedy, a technology probe embodying
        a set of search tools. Post-operative cardio-thoracic surgery patients and
        their visiting family members used the tools to find information about their
        hospital medications and were interviewed before and after their use. Domain
        experts conducted similar search tasks and provided qualitative feedback on
        their preferences and recommendations for designing these tools. Findings
        from our study suggest the importance of four valuation principles underlying
        our tools: credibility, readability, consumer perspective, and topical relevance.",

        "title": "Gaze locking: passive eye contact detection for human-object interaction",
        "abstract": "Eye contact plays a crucial role in our everyday social interactions.
        The ability of a device to reliably detect when a person is looking at it
        can lead to powerful human-object interfaces. Today, most gaze-based interactive
        systems rely on gaze tracking technology. Unfortunately, current gaze tracking
        techniques require active infrared illumination, calibration, or are sensitive
        to distance and pose. In this work, we propose a different solution-a passive,
        appearance-based approach for sensing eye contact in an image. By focusing
        on gaze *locking* rather than gaze tracking, we exploit the special appearance
        of direct eye gaze, achieving a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of
        over 0.83 at long distances (up to 18 m) and large pose variations (up to
        \u00b130\u00b0 of head yaw rotation) using a very basic classifier and without
        calibration. To train our detector, we also created a large publicly available
        gaze data set: 5,880 images of 56 people over varying gaze directions and
        head poses. We demonstrate how our method facilitates human-object interaction,
        user analytics, image filtering, and gaze-triggered photography.", "venue":

        about how well it works for head-tracked head worn displays (HWDs). We investigated
        the effect of Subtle Cueing for head-tracked head worn displays, using visual
        search research methods in simulated augmented reality environments. Our user
        study found that Subtle Cueing improves visual search performance, and serves
        as a feasible cueing mechanism for AR environments using HWDs.", "venue":

        tasks in augmented reality. The goal is to improve the accuracy and efficiency
        with which a remote expert can point out a real physical object at a local
        site to a technician at that site. In a typical referencing task, the remote
        expert instructs the local technician to navigate to a location from which
        a target object can be viewed, and then to attend to that object. The expert
        and technician both wear head-tracked, stereo, see-through, head-worn displays,
        and the expert''s hands are tracked by a set of depth cameras. The remote
        expert first selects one of a set of prerecorded viewpoints of the local site,
        and a representation of that viewpoint is presented to the technician to help
        them navigate to the correct position and orientation. The expert then uses
        hand gestures to indicate the target.", "venue": "IEEE Symposium on 3D User

        IEEE Virtual Reality 2012 full papers program, contained in this special issue,
        includes 15 papers that present research, applications, and systems in the
        field of virtual reality. They were selected from 95 submissions by an international
        program committee of 63 members, supported by 147 external expert reviewers,
        leading to an acceptance rate for IEEE Virtual Reality 2012 of 15.8%. All
        papers appearing in this issue have undergone a two-round review process.
        In the first round review, at least four expert reviewers reviewed the work.
        The paper chairs selected the primary and secondary reviewers from the international
        program committee, and the primary reviewer then recruited at least two external
        experts. After completion of all reviews, the primary reviewer led an online
        discussion phase, which resulted in an initial recommendation for acceptance
        or rejection and a set of modifications that were deemed necessary. Based
        on this recommendation, the program committee, at the two-day online web meeting,
        selected an initial set of papers for preliminary acceptance. The authors
        of these papers were given the opportunity to refine and resubmit their work.
        In the second round review, IPC members checked whether the changes made were
        sufficient to warrant final acceptance. Based on their input, paper chairs
        made the final decisions for papers appearing in the TVCG issue. The IEEE
        VR scientific program also includes 13 short papers published in a separate
        report. Many individuals have contributed a great deal of time and energy
        to making the IEEE Virtual Reality 2012 conference and this special issue
        a success. We would like to thank the authors of all submitted papers, the
        members of the Program Committee, as well as all the other reviewers for their
        many hours of hard work. We also wish to acknowledge James Stewart for his
        outstanding and timely support with the PCS review system. This year, the
        Program Committee meeting was run under the Elluminate web conferencing system,
        access to which was graciously provided by University of Florida. We are grateful
        to Ben Lok for his help and his expertise with Elluminate. As usual, the paper
        chairs are indebted to the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee
        (VGTC) publication team, especially the Publications Coordinator, Meghan Haley,
        for coordinating schedules, collecting materials, and producing these conference
        proceedings. We warmly thank the Virtual Reality steering committee, especially
        its chair Doug Bowman for his valuable advice at every stage, and Ming C.

        by a depth camera, and users wear tracked see-through displays. We present
        the results of a user study that compares GARDEN against existing augmented
        reality referencing techniques, as well as the use of a physical laser pointer.
        GARDEN performed significantly more accurately than all the comparison techniques

        rely on explicit cueing, which can potentially reduce visual search performance.

        a simple way to overcome the limited screen real-estate on mobile devices.
        We present virtual projection (VP), an interaction metaphor inspired by how
        we intuitively control the position, size, and orientation of a handheld optical
        projector''s image. VP is based on tracking a handheld device without an optical
        projector and allows selecting a target display on which to position, scale,
        and orient an item in a single gesture. By relaxing the optical projection
        metaphor, we can deviate from modeling perspective projection, for example,
        to constrain scale or orientation, create multiple copies, or offset the image.
        VP also supports dynamic filtering based on the projection frustum, creating
        overview and detail applications, and selecting portions of a larger display
        for zooming and panning. We show exemplary use cases implemented using our
        optical feature-tracking framework and present the results of a user study

        become active participants in their own care, recent research has begun to
        explore the direct sharing of electronic health information with patients
        during hospital visits. The design of patient-facing views of clinical information
        is, however, a relatively recent line of inquiry. Research is needed to further
        understand guidelines for communicating specific types of information to hospital
        patients. In this work, we focus on cardiology patients'' information needs
        related to their hospital medications. We assessed these needs to inform the
        design of interactive, electronic views of medication information for cardiology
        inpatients. We present results of in-situ interviews with 11 inpatients and
        6 nurses in a cardiology step-down unit. Our findings suggest that cohesive
        trends in medication information needs exist across cardiology inpatients.
        We discuss interview results and their implications for the design of inpatient-facing
        information technology. We also discuss key ways in which electronic medication
        information, formatted for inpatient use, differs from that formatted for

        The system stores still images of scenes along with camera poses, so that

        and Repair", "abstract": "We explore the development of an experimental augmented
        reality application that provides benefits to professional mechanics performing
        maintenance and repair tasks in a field setting. We developed a prototype
        that supports military mechanics conducting routine maintenance tasks inside
        an armored vehicle turret, and evaluated it with a user study. Our prototype
        uses a tracked headworn display to augment a mechanic''s natural view with
        text, labels, arrows, and animated sequences designed to facilitate task comprehension,
        localization, and execution. A within-subject controlled user study examined
        professional military mechanics using our system to complete 18 common tasks
        under field conditions. These tasks included installing and removing fasteners
        and indicator lights, and connecting cables, all within the cramped interior
        of an armored personnel carrier turret. An augmented reality condition was
        tested against two baseline conditions: the same headworn display providing
        untracked text and graphics and a fixed flat panel display representing an
        improved version of the laptop-based documentation currently employed in practice.
        The augmented reality condition allowed mechanics to locate tasks more quickly
        than when using either baseline, and in some instances, resulted in less overall
        head movement. A qualitative survey showed that mechanics found the augmented
        reality condition intuitive and satisfying for the tested sequence of tasks.",

        "Summary Objective: To support collaboration and clinician-targeted decision
        support, electronic health records (EHRs) must contain accurate information
        about patients\u2019 care providers. The objective of this study was to evaluate
        two approaches for care provider identification employed within a commercial
        EHR at a large academic medical center. Methods: We performed a retrospective
        review of EHR data for 121 patients in two cardiology wards during a four-week
        period. System audit logs of chart accesses were analyzed to identify the
        clinicians who were likely participating in the patients\u2019 hospital care.
        The audit log data were compared with two functions in the EHR for documenting
        care team membership: 1) a vendor-supplied module called \u201cCare Providers\u201d,
        and 2) a custom \u201cDesignate Provider\u201d order that was created primarily
        to improve accuracy of the attending physician of record documentation. Results:
        For patients with a 3\u20135 day hospital stay, an average of 30.8 clinicians
        accessed the electronic chart, including 10.2 nurses, 1.4 attending physicians,
        2.3 residents, and 5.4 physician assistants. The Care Providers module identified
        2.7 clinicians/patient (1.8 attending physicians and 0.9 nurses). The Designate
        Provider order identified 2.1 clinicians/patient (1.1 attending physicians,
        0.2 resident physicians, and 0.8 physician assistants). Information about
        other members of patients\u2019 care teams (social workers, dietitians, pharmacists,
        etc.) was absent. Conclusions: The two methods for specifying care team information
        failed to identify numerous individuals involved in patients\u2019 care, suggesting
        that commercial EHRs may not provide adequate tools for care team designation.
        Improvements to EHR tools could foster greater collaboration among care teams
        and reduce communication-related risks to patient safety.", "venue": "Applied

        augmented reality (AR) user interface designed to assist users in the relatively
        under-explored psychomotor phase of procedural tasks. In this phase, the user

        A user study shows participants were able to complete psychomotor aspects
        of the assembly task significantly faster and with significantly greater accuracy
        than when using 3D-graphics-based assistance presented on a stationary LCD.

        by conducting a between-subject experiment in a CAVE. In PF, the positions
        of the user''s head and hands are projected onto the ground, and travel direction
        and speed are computed based on direction and magnitude of the vector from
        the midpoint of the projected hand positions to the projected head position.
        The two baseline conditions both use a single hand to control the direction,
        with speed controlled discretely by button pushes with the same hand in one
        case, and continuously by the distance between the hands in the other case.
        Users were asked to travel through a simple virtual world and collect virtual
        coins within a set time. We found no significant differences between travel
        conditions for reported presence or usability, but a significant increase
        in nausea with PF. Total travel distance was significantly higher for the

        "Opportunistic Controls are a class of user interaction techniques that we
        have developed for augmented reality (AR) applications to support gesturing
        on, and receiving feedback from, otherwise unused affordances already present
        in the domain environment. By leveraging characteristics of these affordances
        to provide passive haptics that ease gesture input, Opportunistic Controls
        simplify gesture recognition, and provide tangible feedback to the user. In
        this approach, 3D widgets are tightly coupled with affordances to provide
        visual feedback and hints about the functionality of the control. For example,
        a set of buttons can be mapped to existing tactile features on domain objects.
        We describe examples of Opportunistic Controls that we have designed and implemented
        using optical marker tracking, combined with appearance-based gesture recognition.
        We present the results of two user studies. In the first, participants performed
        a simulated maintenance inspection of an aircraft engine using a set of virtual
        buttons implemented both as Opportunistic Controls and using simpler passive
        haptics. Opportunistic Controls allowed participants to complete their tasks
        significantly faster and were preferred over the baseline technique. In the
        second, participants proposed and demonstrated user interfaces incorporating
        Opportunistic Controls for two domains, allowing us to gain additional insights
        into how user interfaces featuring Opportunistic Controls might be designed.",

        techniques that involve taking still pictures of a physical scene using a
        tracked hand-held magic lens and seamlessly switching between augmenting either
        the live view or one of the still views, without needing to physically revisit
        the snapshot locations. We describe our optical-marker-tracking-based implementation
        and how we represent and switch among snapshots. To determine the effectiveness
        of our techniques, we developed a test application that lets its user view
        physical and virtual objects from different viewpoints.", "venue": "2010 IEEE

        the 3DOF absolute orientation tracker on the head-worn display with 6DOF optical

        significant differences in performance when comparing four techniques we developed
        for a tracked mobile device, where two existing touch-screen techniques served
        as baselines. The mobile techniques, however, had more consistent performance

        "title": "Interference avoidance in multi-user hand-held augmented reality",
        "abstract": "In a multi-user augmented reality application for a shared physical
        environment, it is possible for users to interfere with each other. For example,
        in a multi-player game in which each player holds a display whose tracked
        position and orientation affect the outcome, one player may physically block
        another player''s view or physically contact another player. We explore software
        techniques intended to avoid such interference. These techniques modify what
        a user sees or hears, and what interaction capabilities they have, when their
        display gets too close to another user''s display. We present Redirected Motion,
        an effective, yet nondistracting, interference avoidance technique for hand-held
        AR, which transforms the 3D space in which the user moves their display, to
        direct the display away from other displays. We conducted a within-subject,
        formal user study to evaluate the effectiveness and distraction level of Redirected
        Motion compared to other interference avoidance techniques. The study is based
        on an instrumented, two-player, first-person-shooter, augmented reality game,
        in which each player holds a 6DOF-tracked ultra-mobile computer. Comparison
        conditions include an unmanipulated control condition and three other software
        techniques for avoiding interference: dimming the display, playing disturbing
        sounds, and disabling interaction capabilities. Subjective evaluation indicates
        that Redirected Motion was unnoticeable, and quantitative analysis shows that
        the mean distance between users during Redirected Motion was significantly
        larger than for the comparison conditions.", "venue": "2009 8th IEEE International

        presentation and system control. We explore the design space of shake menus,
        which are intended for use in tangible augmented reality. Shake menus are
        radial menus displayed centered on a physical object and activated by shaking
        that object. One important aspect of their design space is the coordinate
        system used to present menu options. We conducted a within-subjects user study

        shake menus in augmented reality (world-referenced, display-referenced, and
        object-referenced), along with a baseline technique (a linear menu on a clipboard).
        Our findings suggest tradeoffs amongst speed, efficacy, and flexibility of
        interaction, and point towards the possible advantages of hybrid approaches

        the design, implementation, and user testing of a prototype augmented reality

        sequences designed to facilitate task comprehension, location, and execution.
        A within-subject controlled user study examined professional military mechanics
        using our system to complete 18 common tasks under field conditions. These
        tasks included installing and removing fasteners and indicator lights, and
        connecting cables, all within the cramped interior of an armored personnel
        carrier turret. An augmented reality condition was tested against two baseline
        conditions: an untracked headworn display with text and graphics and a fixed
        flat panel display representing an improved version of the laptop-based documentation
        currently employed in practice. The augmented reality condition allowed mechanics
        to locate tasks more quickly than when using either baseline, and in some

        "Time-series graphs are often used to visualize phenomena that change over
        time. Common tasks include comparing values at different points in time and
        searching for specified patterns, either exact or approximate. However, tools
        that support time-series graphs typically separate query specification from
        the actual search process, allowing users to adapt the level of similarity
        only after specifying the pattern. We introduce relaxed selection techniques,
        in which users implicitly define a level of similarity that can vary across
        the search pattern, while creating a search query with a single-gesture interaction.
        Users sketch over part of the graph, establishing the level of similarity
        through either spatial deviations from the graph, or the speed at which they
        sketch (temporal deviations). In a user study, participants were significantly
        faster when using our temporally relaxed selection technique than when using
        traditional techniques. In addition, they achieved significantly higher precision
        and recall with our spatially relaxed selection technique compared to traditional

        for Patient Note Generation", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION A patient note is
        a clinical document, written by a physician, describing a patient under his
        or her care. Various kinds of notes document the patient\u2019s status over
        time, and comprise the official medical record for legal and billing purposes.
        Composing these notes encompasses several disparate, but interdependent subtasks.
        Physicians gather and review previous and current patient data, such as lab
        results, physical exams, medications, and hospital events, to determine patient
        progress; select and input relevant information for the current note; and
        form appropriate assessments and plans for each patient. Currently, most of
        these subtasks are not supported by domain-informed assistance. While sophisticated
        systems exist for retrieving and visualizing clinical patient data (e.g.,
        [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]), support for inserting this data into a patient note is limited,
        less flexible, and more complicated to use than editing notes manually in
        a generic word processing application. In practice, physicians often edit
        each current note by hand\u2014 manually searching through previous notes
        and copying and modifying material written for previous notes\u2014a time-consuming
        and error-prone process. We are working with physicians in the New York Presbyterian
        Hospital (NYPH) Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU) to design a user
        interface for patient note creation. We are developing new presentation techniques
        through which appropriate content can be recommended, and new interaction
        techniques for effectively browsing, selecting, and inserting these recommendations
        directly into the notes, as they are edited.", "venue": "", "year": 2008,

        tapping, that use zooming to make possible precise interaction on passive
        touch screens, and describe examples of each. Rub-Pointing uses a diagonal
        rubbing gesture to integrate pointing and zooming in a single-handed technique.
        In contrast, Zoom-Tapping is a two-handed technique in which the dominant
        hand points, while the non-dominant hand taps to zoom, simulating multi-touch
        functionality on a single-touch display. Rub-Tapping is a hybrid technique
        that integrates rubbing with the dominant hand to point and zoom, and tapping
        with the non-dominant hand to confirm selection. We describe the results of
        a formal user study comparing these techniques with each other and with the
        well-known Take-Off and Zoom-Pointing selection techniques. Rub-Pointing and
        Zoom-Tapping had significantly fewer errors than Take-Off for small targets,

        "Virtual worlds (a.k.a. virtual realities) are 3D computer-generated environments
        created through the use of high-performance computers, 3D interaction devices,

        with additional information. This approach is called augmented reality and
        was pioneered by Ivan Sutherland, who, over a quarter century ago, developed
        the first see-through head-mounted display [8]. His system presented graphics
        to the user on a pair of stereo displays, worn on the user\u2019s head. The
        image produced by the displays was combined with the user\u2019s view of the
        world using half-silvered mirrors. A 3D tracking system determined the position
        and orientation of the user\u2019s head. This enabled the system to change
        the view, based on the direction in which the wearer was looking. Consider
        some of the possibilities: Graphics, text, and sound overlaid on the surrounding
        world could explain how to operate, maintain, or repair equipment, without
        requiring that the user refer to a separate paper or electronic manual. Similarly,
        participants in a business meeting could interact with a dynamic shared financial
        or organizational model, represented in 3D and selectively supplemented with
        each user\u2019s private personal annotations. This brief paper provides an
        overview of the work being done at Columbia\u2019s Computer Graphics and User
        Interfaces Laboratory to address fundamental issues in designing effective
        augmented reality systems. We describe \u201chybrid user interfaces\u201d
        that merge 2D and 3D displays and interaction devices, augmented realities
        that annotate the surrounding physical world with knowledge-based 3D graphics,
        and augmented realities that extend a contemporary window-based environment
        so that it becomes part of a wearable information surround. These projects
        all use the head-mounted display shown in Figure 1. We assembled it from a
        Reflection Technology Private Eye, a Logitech ultrasonic 3D position and orientation
        tracker, and a mirror beam splitter. The Private Eye is a small 720 \u00d7280
        resolution bitmapped display [6]. We positioned the beam splitter so that
        the user can see the surrounding world through it and the Private Eye reflected
        from it. The triangle at the top of the visor contains the sensors for the
        ultrasonic tracker.", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount":

        3D Selection", "abstract": "Balloon selection is a 3D interaction technique
        that is modeled after the real world metaphor of manipulating a helium balloon
        attached to a string. Balloon selection allows for precise 3D selection in
        the volume above a tabletop surface by using multiple fingers on a multi-touch-sensitive
        surface. The 3DOF selection tasks is decomposed in part into a 2DOF positioning
        task performed by one finger on the tabletop in an absolute 2D Cartesian coordinate
        system and a 1DOF positioning task performed by another finger on the tabletop
        in a relative 2D polar coordinate system. We have evaluated balloon selection
        in a formal user study that compared it to two well-known interaction techniques
        for selecting a static 3D target: a 3DOF tracked wand and keyboard cursor
        keys. We found that balloon selection was significantly faster than using
        cursor keys and had a significantly lower error rate than the wand. The lower
        error rate appeared to result from the user''s hands being supported by the
        tabletop surface, resulting in significantly reduced hand tremor and arm fatigue.",

        Reality imbues physical objects with the ability to act and respond in new

        world. Visual hints enable discovery, learning, and completion of gestures

        "abstract": "In the past two decades, interaction for desktop computing systems
        has been dominated by graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that use a keyboard
        for text entry and a pointing device controlling an on-screen cursor for the
        majority of other tasks. These human-computer interfaces rely on the visual
        display system for two purposes: to provide data output, and to provide visual
        feedback. In this thesis we shall discuss why these interfaces are not the
        most appropriate on wearable computing systems, where the user''s visual attention
        may be heavily loaded and input devices and display devices need to be compact
        and portable. \nThis dissertation presents a set of interaction techniques
        for touch-sensor-based input devices that address these issues. Our user interface
        systems are cursorless. Therefore, they do not rely on the manipulation and
        activation of on-screen visual widgets with the use of an on-screen pointer.
        Consequently, they minimize the amount of visual feedback that is needed during
        their operation. \nWe explore alternative input channels\u2014in addition
        to position\u2014that the human hand can manipulate and output channels that
        the finger can sense: multi-finger use, applied pressure, and passive haptics
        provided by tangible physical features. Here, the focus is on minimizing visual
        feedback requirements by transferring the versatility of GUIs that use on-screen
        widgets to the input device itself. A further goal is to offer expert users
        the possibility of eyes-free data entry and system control by exploiting the
        passive tactile physical features of the input device. We present the results
        of quantitative and qualitative user studies designed to evaluate our input
        techniques. \nIn addition to describing these input systems and their prototype
        implementations, we discuss sample applications developed to illustrate the
        use of these input techniques. We also discuss the applicability of these
        contributions to other fields of computer science: mobile augmented reality,
        immersive virtual reality, and interaction with public displays.", "venue":

        reality", "abstract": "This dissertation investigates the research challenges
        in authoring and presenting situated media in augmented and virtual reality.
        We use the term situated media to refer to multimedia and hypermedia that
        are embedded in the surrounding spatial environment. Linking information to
        physical objects and locations provides the ability to access and interact
        with information in context, using head-worn and hand-held displays. It potentially
        eases interaction with the physical world, enhances perception, and helps
        with users'' tasks. \nWe have developed authoring techniques that enable non-programmer
        users to create a variety of augmented and virtual reality experiences, ranging
        from stand-alone multimedia to richly linked hypermedia narratives embedded
        in the users'' surroundings, which we call situated hypermedia. Depending
        on the task at hand, and the level of precision required, users can use stationary
        desktop-based or mobile tablet-based tools for authoring, to take advantage
        of the different input devices and interaction techniques available on these
        platforms. We collaborated with content creators who used our desktop-based
        authoring system and related presentation tools at different stages of their
        development to author situated hypermedia for course projects, and present
        informal feedback from these experiences. \nAn essential complement to authoring
        is the ability to present the created content in an interactive and intuitive
        way to the users. To accomplish this, we have developed presentation techniques
        that make it possible for users to interact with situated media and navigate
        in large situated media spaces. Our augmenting pictures technique and animated
        timelines register and superimpose historic images onto real or virtual objects
        and provide a means of interacting with them, to make it possible for users
        to gain a better understanding of historic events and places. Our lifting,
        tilting, shifting and scaling techniques enable users to navigate and visualize
        complex hypermedia structures distributed across large distances. Using our
        techniques, users can selectively \"pick up\" interesting parts of a complex
        situated hypermedia structure, lift or tilt them to view otherwise occluded
        nodes and links, as well as shift and scale the structure for closer examination.
        We also present the results of a formal user study that evaluates several
        of these techniques.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        as a secondary 1D display. Since it is possible to unwind the display itself
        and trigger functionality with a single pull, information may be accessed
        and presented quickly, and perceived at a glance. We present scenarios for

        "title": "Automated layout of information presentations", "abstract": "Layout
        refers to the process of determining the sizes and positions of the visual
        objects that are part of an information presentation. Automated layout refers
        to the use of a computer program to automate either all or part of the layout
        process. This field of research lies at the crossroads of artificial intelligence
        and human computer interaction. Automated layout of presentations is becoming
        increasingly important as the amount of data that we need to present rapidly
        overtakes our ability to present it manually. \nWe present a set of novel
        techniques that can assist an automated layout system to produce an effective
        presentation of information, given a set of components to display and metadata
        describing relationships between those components. Unlike the vast majority
        of previous approaches to layout and numerous related problems, our techniques
        attempt to mimic the workflow used by a human graphic designer when manually
        creating a presentation. \nOur techniques include a method to control the
        length of text being displayed that is inspired by the capability of a designer
        to ask a copy editor for a change in the content length to suit a particular
        layout. We have also developed a method for automatically evaluating and improving
        the visual balance of a layout that closely mirrors the process used by graphic
        designers. Finally, we have developed a method to deliver layouts produced
        by our techniques using a thin-client approach. \nOur techniques are uniquely
        capable of capturing the irregular and sometimes counterintuitive tactics
        used by human designers to create layouts. When combined with a model of the
        workflow used by human graphic designers, our techniques allow systems to
        automatically generate layouts that are highly effective, superior in both
        form and function to those generated by investigations into this field to

        which a sentence is spoken and the presence of extraneous utterances. We also
        show how coarse audio localization can be used for low-fidelity gesture tracking,

        we created a functional simulation of a wrist-worn projector. We then developed
        a set of interaction techniques that assume that the wrist-worn computer and
        projector are equipped with position and orientation sensors, in addition
        to a touch-sensitive built-in screen. To complement the techniques that rely
        on the spatial manipulation of the user''s forearm and the device itself,
        we also describe the use of a cursor less watch user interface that minimizes
        the need for the user to look down at the device''s built-in screen. Finally,
        we present a sample application that illustrates our interaction techniques.",

        "title": "View management for distributed user interfaces", "abstract": "We
        present a new approach to designing user interfaces based on view management.
        View management refers to layout decisions that determine spatial relationships
        between objects, taking into account visibility constraints that allow applications
        to man age what users see. Our techniques are used to satisfy these constraints
        by controlling what is seen in a wide range of user interfaces: from 2D desktops
        to 3D immersive environments, from view-only presentations to interactive
        techniques, and from single user to collaborative situations. \nScreen space
        is a difficult resource to utilize properly in user interfaces. Poorly designed
        user interfaces, consisting of overlapping windows, unwanted popups, and unused
        screen space, occur on many different types of displays, such as PDAs, laptops,
        cell phones, and wall-sized displays. We avoid these problems by providing
        techniques for representing and managing unused screen space to avoid overlapping
        when possible. Applying these techniques to 3D user interfaces imposes visual
        constraints on the placement of objects, such as labels and annotations, relative
        to the 2D visible projections of 3D objects on the view plane. We develop
        techniques to handle issues such as performance and temporal stabilization,
        and we create guidelines to help ensure that labels and annotations behave
        well across a wide range of situations. \nWe have applied our techniques to
        augmented reality, in which information is visualized directly within the
        context of the real world by overlaying graphics onto what is seen. We develop
        tools, including an annotated situation-awareness aid based on a world in
        miniature , that make it easy to visualize information about the environment,
        including parts of the environment that might not be completely visible from
        their current location. \nWe extend these ideas further into distributed interactive
        environments. In a world encompassing a wide range of display technologies,
        we are interested in how people will access, use, and interact with information
        and each other. All of this work presented has been developed (or redeveloped)
        using an efficient rule-based programming technique we call Data Programming
        , which is designed for standalone and distributed development and has given
        us the flexibility to investigate a wide range of scenarios in these environments.",

        REALITY", "abstract": "Tracking accuracy in a location-aware mobile system
        can change dynamically as a function of the user\u2019s location and other
        variables specific to the tracking technologies used. This is especially problematic
        for mobile augmented reality systems, which ideally require extremely precise
        position tracking for the user\u2019s head, but which may not always be able
        to achieve that level of accuracy. While it is possible to ignore variable
        positional accuracy in an augmented reality user interface, this can make
        for a confusing system; for example, when accuracy is low, virtual objects
        that are nominally registered with real ones may be too far off to be of use.
        To address this problem, we describe an experimental mobile augmented reality
        system that: (1) employs multiple position-tracking technologies, including
        ones that apply heuristics based on environmental knowledge; (2) coordinates
        these concurrently monitored tracking systems; and (3) automatically adapts
        the user interface to varying degrees of confidence in tracking accuracy.
        We share our experiences with managing these multiple tracking technologies,
        employing various techniques to facilitate smooth and reasonable \u2018\u2018hand-offs\u2019\u2019
        between the cooperating systems. We present these results in the context of
        a intelligent navigational guidance system that helps users to orient themselves
        in an unfamiliar environment, using path planning to guide them toward destinations
        they choose, and sometimes towards ones the system infers as equally relevant.",

        visualization tool that can be used by researchers to explore and understand
        the site. The pipeline includes new methods for shadow-based registration
        of 2D images and temporal change detection. Our multimodal augmented reality

        the premier forum for presentation of research innovations in the software
        and technology of human-computer interfaces. UIST brings together researchers
        and practitioners from diverse areas that include traditional graphical and
        web user interfaces, tangible and ubiquitous computing, virtual and augmented
        reality, multimedia, new input and output devices, and CSCW. The intimate
        size, the single track, and comfortable surroundings make this symposium an
        ideal opportunity to exchange research results and implementation experience.
        \n \nThe call for papers attracted 118 full paper submissions and 52 TechNote
        submissions from Asia, Europe, North and South America, and the South Pacific.
        The program committee accepted 24 full papers (20%) and 12 TechNotes (23%)
        that cover a variety of exciting topics, including augmented reality, design
        tools, toolkits, pen and tactile input, and ambient interfaces. In addition,
        the program includes a keynote speech by Mary Czerwisnki on using theory as
        a basis for human-computer interaction research and two invited surveys by
        Saul Greenberg and Joseph Kaye on Physical User Interfaces and Olfactory Displays,
        respectively. Posters, demos, and our second annual doctoral symposium round
        out our program; UIST attendees receive a separate document that contains
        the accepted submissions for those categories. The UIST proceedings are in
        color for the first time ever and we hope that they will serve as a valuable
        reference for user interface researchers and practitioners. We have supplemented
        the proceedings with a DVD containing videos for almost all of the papers,
        TechNotes, posters, and demonstrations.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount":

        We present EyeGuide, a wearable system that allows the user to obtain information
        quickly from a public display without sacrificing privacy. To this end, EyeGuide
        employs a lightweight head-worn eye-tracker for hands-free object selection
        and an earphone for private communication. Our system supports public displays
        that are dynamic (e.g., a large plasma screen) and static (e.g., a large printed
        map). In our printed map scenario, EyeGuide whispers verbal directions via
        earphone to a user, based on where they are looking on the map. Using a technique
        we call \"gaze steering,\" the system guides the user''s eye position to specific
        locations. In our dynamic public display scenarios, EyeGuide presents documents
        (e.g., maps) that contain sensitive data in a way that preserves privacy.",

        distinguished panel to discuss and debate the directions and frameworks for
        telepresence. Some of the questions brought up in the last two years continue
        to be on the top of our minds: Why is telepresence not as common as we think
        it can be today? How much technology is too much in a telepresence system?
        Is there too much emphasis on creating an immersive telepresence system? Which
        are the suitable paradigms for telepresence? How much are they dependent on
        the task and application? Which are the most effective telepresence systems
        we have today? How do we make telepresence more effective? How do we shift
        the focus from transmitting multi-modal data to creating effective means of
        experiencing remote environments and events?", "venue": "ACM SIGMM workshop

        that is based on bidirectional strokes that are segmented by tactile landmarks.
        By giving the user tactile feedback about the length of a stroke during input,
        we decrease the dependence of the GUI on the visual display. By concatenating
        separate strokes into multistrokes, complex commands may be entered, which
        may encode commands, data content, or both simultaneously. To demonstrate
        their power, we show how multistrokes can be used to traverse a menu hierarchy
        quickly. In addition, we show how inter-landmark segments of the sensor may
        be used for continuous and discrete parameter entry, resulting in a multifunctional
        interaction paradigm. We also introduce multiwidgets, which allow the direct
        control of multiple virtual widgets without the need to change the state of
        the device or use modifier buttons. This approach to input does not depend
        on material displayed visually to the user, and, thanks to tactile guidance,
        may be used by expert users as an eyes-free user interface. We believe that
        these benefits make this interaction system especially suitable for wearable
        computer systems that use a head-worn display and wrist-worn watch-style devices.",

        "title": "BRIDGING THE GAPS: HYBRID TRACKING FOR ADAPTIVE MOBILE AUGMENTED
        REALITY", "abstract": "Tracking accuracy in a location-aware mobile system
        can change dynamically as a function of the user''s location and other variables
        specific to the tracking technologies used. This is especially problematic
        for mobile augmented reality systems, which ideally require extremely precise
        position tracking for the user''s head, but which may not always be able to
        achieve that level of accuracy. While it is possible to ignore variable positional
        accuracy in an augmented reality user interface, this can make for a confusing
        system; for example, when accuracy is low, virtual objects that are nominally
        registered with real ones may be too far off to be of use. To address this
        problem, we describe an experimental mobile augmented reality system that:
        (1) employs multiple position-tracking technologies, including ones that apply
        heuristics based on environmental knowledge; (2) coordinates these concurrently
        monitored tracking systems; and (3) automatically adapts the user interface
        to varying degrees of confidence in tracking accuracy. We share our experiences
        with managing these multiple tracking technologies, employing various techniques
        to facilitate smooth and reasonable \u201chand-offs\u201d between the cooperating
        systems. We present these results in the context of an intelligent navigational
        guidance system that helps users to orient themselves in an unfamiliar environment,
        using path planning to guide them toward destinations they choose, and sometimes
        towards ones the system infers as equally relevant.", "venue": "Applied Artificial

        "title": "1 Computational Tools for Modeling , Visualizing and Analyzing Historic
        and Archaeological Sites", "abstract": "We are proposing to develop computational
        tools for researchers and students to model, visualize, and analyze historic
        and ancient sites. This proposal addresses four major scientific components
        to support this research. First, we are proposing new methods of creating
        complex, 3-D, photorealistic models of large sites. This includes a mobile
        robot sensing system that can be used as an intelligent sensing device over
        a large scale. Second, we are proposing to develop new methods to image below-ground
        data accurately and efficiently. These methods are especially suited to modeling
        the wealth of subsurface information at archaeological sites. Third, we will
        be developing new database technology to catalog and access a site\u2019s
        structures, artifacts, objects, and historical references. This will significantly
        improve a user\u2019s ability to query and analyze a site\u2019s information.
        Fourth, we have created a wearable augmented reality system for presenting
        georegistered information to mobile users, using overlaid graphics and sound.
        We will extend this system to create a new class of information visualization
        systems that integrate 3D aboveand below-ground models, 2D images, text and
        other web-based resources to annotate the physical environment We will apply
        this system to support scientists in the field, as well to allow on-site and
        remote tours of historic and ancient sites. We are intrigued by the possibility
        of an historic site serving as the nexus for introducing complex ideas from
        a variety of disciplines: mathematics, earth sciences, economics, geography,
        literature, languages, politics, and history. Our ability to model, visualize
        and analyze the site is at the center of this endeavor. We have assembled
        a team of seasoned researchers from the Columbia community with scientific
        and historical preservation backgrounds who will work together to achieve
        our goal. Prof. Peter Allen provides experience in 3D modeling, computer vision
        and robotics. Prof. Roelof Versteeg specializes in below-ground and noninvasive
        sensing. Prof. Kenneth Ross is an expert on databases and new methods of accessing
        data. Prof. Steven Feiner is at the forefront of user interface design and
        augmented reality. Prof. Lynn Meskell is an authority on Ancient Egyptian
        Archaeology and Field Director of the Columbia Excavations at Amheida, Egypt
        [16]. Prof. Stephen Murray is a leader in bringing the ancient and historic
        world alive through his use of new technology. This includes visualization
        techniques for historic sites as demonstrated in his successful Amiens Cathedral
        project [46, 4] and the Medieval Architecture Digital Teaching Project that
        recruits a dozen international scholar/teachers to construct a course dealing
        with one thousand years of medieval architecture. Dr. Maurice Luker has collaborated
        extensively with Profs. Murray and Meskell on both ancient cathedral projects
        and Egyptian Archaeology. As part of the scientific research proposed above,
        we want to explore the integration and system building issues of merging these
        disparate technologies into a powerful set of computational tools that can
        be extended to other historic and ancient sites and related applications.
        The focus of archaeological research has progressively shifted from being
        object-centered to one that uses methodologies that recover larger and more
        diverse sets of data. Archaeological information can now be accessed through
        an increasing number of techniques: scientific, computerized and digital.
        This project explores new possibilities for acquiring, organizing, analyzing,
        and visualizing this information. Developing these computational tools is
        a complex project that requires integration efforts between groups of researchers
        and technologies. We will be testing these tools at a unique site in Egypt\u2019s
        Western Desert, but it is important that we refine our methods locally and
        create known working systems before we begin our work in Egypt. Accordingly,
        we have selected the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York, adjacent
        to the Columbia campus, to serve as an initial testbed. The Cathedral of St.
        John the Divine offers both a compelling and complex history and an extraordinarily
        complete set of visual and textual documentation. The photographic archive
        is particularly rich, including a remarkable collection of images from 1892
        to 1940 during the main period of construction. We will model this building
        and map the documentary evidence to it so that the user can follow", "venue":

        increase in power and decrease in size, new mobile, wearable, and pervasive
        computing applications are rapidly becoming feasible, providing people access

        new kind of applications that exploit the person''s surrounding context. Augmented
        reality (AR) presents a particularly powerful user interface (UI) to context-aware
        computing environments. AR systems integrate virtual information into a person''s
        physical environment so that he or she will perceive that information as existing
        in their surroundings. Mobile augmented reality systems (MARS) provide this
        service without constraining the individual\u2019s whereabouts to a specially
        equipped area. Ideally, they work virtually anywhere, adding a palpable layer
        of information to any environment whenever desired. By doing so, they hold
        the potential to revolutionize the way in which information is presented to
        people. Computer-presented material is directly integrated with the real world
        surrounding the freely roaming person, who can interact with it to display
        related information, to pose and resolve queries, and to collaborate with
        other people. The world becomes the user interface. This chapter provides
        a detailed introduction to mobile AR technology with in-depth reviews of important
        topics, such as wearable display and computing hardware, tracking, registration,
        user interaction, heterogeneous UIs, collaboration, and UI management for

        augmented reality, give a brief overview of the history of the field in general,
        and review some important mobile AR system considerations. Section 9.2 discusses
        the potential and possibilities of MARS technology, with a detailed overview
        of prototype application areas, and reviews the challenges that impede immediate
        widespread commercial adoption. In Section 9.3 we take a closer look at the

        computing", "abstract": "Virtual reality has long been an indoor affair. Whether
        constrained by stationary computers ordisplays, or by the limitations of our
        tracking technologies, researchers typically build virtualenvironments that
        work within a single physical room or a portion of a room. Even distributedvirtual
        reality systems usually interconnect two or more such indoor spaces. Meanwhile,
        ascomputers grow ever smaller and faster, mobile computing is becoming an
        increasingly importantpart of our daily lives, accompanying us wherever we
        go, outdoors, as well as indoors.What will it take for virtual reality to
        move outdoors and finally see the light of day? And, whyshould we care? Within
        the virtual reality research community, work on augmented reality hasalready
        begun to explore outdoor environments-tracking using computer vision, gyroscopes,accelerometers,
        compasses, and GPS; and experimenting with (barely) wearable testbeds. I willdiscuss
        why virtual reality (especially in the form of augmented reality) and mobile
        computing are asynergistic combination, and will provide an overview of the
        research problems that must beaddressed for mobile augmented reality systems
        to play a major role in our future.Among the issues that I will review are
        overcoming physical and aesthetic barriers to mobilityand wearability; tracking
        and registration of heads, hands, bodies, and other objects; renderingvirtual
        objects in the real world; and developing sufficiently high quality displays.
        Equallyimportant is the design of head-tracked user interfaces that are well
        suited to mobility. Wearablesystems will need to support collaboration among
        mobile users, facile interaction with real andvirtual objects, and coordination
        across a wide range of heterogeneous displays and devices. Keyhere is the
        volatile nature of mobile interactions-users continually move into and out
        of thepresence of other users, devices, and objects, and rapidly change tasks.
        Furthermore, augmentedreality makes it possible for real and virtual objects
        to share the same display space, creating thepotential for a variety of visually
        confusing relationships as objects overlap and occlude each other.Avoiding
        these problems will require that the virtual world be redesigned and laid

        "In this dissertation, we present typical components of, useful services associated
        with, and user interactions possible with mobile augmented reality systems,
        based on a comprehensive series of hardware and software infrastructures and
        application prototypes we developed. We define a practical taxonomy of user
        interface components for such systems and establish methodology for adaptive
        mobile augmented reality interfaces that dynamically rearrange themselves
        in response to changes in user context. \nThe research contributions to the
        state-of-the-art in augmented reality begin with the author''s participation
        in the design of the \u201cColumbia Touring Machine\u201d in 1997, the first
        example of an outdoor mobile augmented reality system, and his lead in developing
        later prototypes. We develop a series of hardware and software infrastructures
        for prototyping mobile augmented reality applications that allow multiple
        users to participate in collaborative tasks taking place indoors and outdoors.
        \nWe present exploratory user interfaces for many different applications and
        user scenarios, including the Situated Documentaries application framework
        for experiencing spatially distributed hypermedia presentations. Based on
        these explorations, we develop a taxonomic categorization of mobile augmented
        reality interface components and their properties. Virtual and real world
        objects alike are considered part of the interface. We tag each component
        with information about its purpose, its intrinsic properties, its relationship
        to other objects, and its capabilities and flexibility with regard to various
        manipulations. \nMobile augmented reality has until now faced a significant
        challenge: the complexity of the augmented views rapidly increases when many
        virtual objects fight for screen space to annotate physical entities in the
        dynamic views of multiple fast-paced roaming users. Responding to this, we
        develop user interface management techniques for mobile augmented reality.
        A rule-based reasoning architecture uses the taxonomic data classification
        mentioned above to automatically rearrange augmented reality views in dynamic
        situations; for example to remove clutter in the augmented view of the world
        or to react to infrastructural context changes, such as variations in tracking
        accuracy.", "venue": "International Conference on Vision, Video and Graphics",

        and which use a time-stamped history of the objects that intersect them to
        derive statistics for ranking potential referents. We discuss the means by
        which the system supports mutual disambiguation of these modalities and information

        enable their development. Unit places the interaction techniques in an abstraction
        layer between the input devices and the application, which allows the application
        developer to separate application functionality from interaction technique
        and behavior. Unit\u2019s modular approach leads to the design of reusable
        interaction control components that are independent of the application. Unit\u2019s

        assistants (PDAs) combined with wireless networking are beginning to let mobile
        users access the same information they once used only from the office or at
        home. However, researchers have long realized that it''s important not to
        treat mobile computing simply as a scaled-down version of desktop computing.
        Rather, mobility has profound consequences for the way in which we use computers.
        1 For example, desktop users might concentrate on a computer display for long
        periods, but mobile users are often mobile because they want to interact with
        the world around them. Consequently, a common situation when using a PDA to
        find information about our immediate environment is to continuously switch
        between looking around and looking at the PDA display. What if we could instead
        visualize and interact with information directly in the context of our surround-ings?
        Our research group is exploring how augmented reality 2 (AR) could someday
        make this possible. AR integrates a complementary virtual world with the physical
        world\u2014for example, by using head-tracked see-through head-worn displays
        to overlay graphics on what we see. Instead of looking back and forth between
        the real world and a PDA, we look directly at the real world and the virtual
        information overlaid on it. At the heart of this approach is context-aware
        computing, 3 computing systems that are sensitive to the context in which
        they operate, ranging from human relationships to physical location. For example,
        information might be tied to specific locations within a global, Earth-centered,
        coordinate system. 4 How can we design effective mobile AR user inter-faces?
        We''ve been trying to answer this question in part by developing the experimental
        AR research prototypes we describe here. In AR, as in work on information
        visu-alization using desktop technologies, the amount of information available
        can far exceed what a system can legibly display at a given time, necessitating
        information filtering. Julier et al. 5 have developed information filtering
        techniques for AR that depend on the user''s goals, object importance, and
        proximity. In the descriptions that follow, we assume that a system can accomplish
        information filtering of this sort and that our system is displaying everything
        it should. We''re especially interested in how an AR system could provide
        information at a glance to aid a mobile user exploring an unfamiliar environment.
        Such a user might be a tourist visiting a foreign city or a native trying
        to find a building from its address. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount":

        are so prevalent that the role of a PC today has been largely reduced to a

        of network-centric applications typically rely on the limited capabilities
        of HTML, employing proprietary \"plug ins\" or transmitting the binary image
        of an entire application that will be executed on the client. Alternatively,
        implementers can develop without regard for remote use, requiring users who
        wish to run such applications on a remote server to rely on a system that
        creates a virtual frame buffer on the server, and transmits a copy of its
        raster image to the local client.We review some of the problems that these
        current approaches pose, and show how they can be solved by developing a distributed

        "The term mixed reality (MR) was first used in the mid 1990s (Milgram & Kishino,
        1994), after the popularization of virtual reality (VR). VR refers to the
        experience of users immersed in a virtual computer-created world. Thus, the
        world of VR exists within the computer. In contrast, MR attempts to correlate
        the virtual world with the real world. At one end of the spectrum of ways
        in which virtual and real worlds can be combined is augmented reality (AR),
        a term that was first used in the early 1990s (Caudell & Mizell, 1992). AR
        supplements the real world with information obtained from a virtual world;
        for example, a seethrough head-mounted display (HMD) may be used to superimpose
        a computer-generated image on the user\u2019s view of the real world. Augmented
        virtuality (AV), in contrast, refers to augmenting a virtual world with information
        obtained from the real world. Using AV, a more realistic virtual world than
        that of VR can be realized; for example, complex shapes and actual images
        of naturally occurring objects can be incorporated into a virtual world. In
        1997, Mixed Reality Systems Laboratory Inc. was inaugurated in Japan as the
        founding body for a four-year joint project between the Ministry of International
        Trade and Industry (MITI) and Canon Inc. Three universities, the University
        of Tokyo, Hokkaido University and the University of Tsukuba, joined the collaboration,
        and an MR research group comprising industry, government and academia was
        established. The editors of this special issue, Ohta and Hirose, are collaborative
        researchers involved in the project, and Feiner participated as an international
        advisor. As part of this project, the International Symposium on Mixed Reality
        (ISMR) was held twice, in 1999 and 2001, to encourage MR research worldwide.
        To compile this special issue, we selected some of the best papers presented
        at ISMR 2001, and asked their authors to submit revised versions for review.
        The following is a brief summary of the articles included in this special
        issue. Sawada and colleagues report on one of the core AR technologies: head
        tracking. Sawada\u2019s group describes a hardware solution based on miniature
        high-precision gyroscopes. Hedley and colleagues and Walairacht and colleagues
        present studies of user interface devices for freely manipulating the AR environment.
        Lee and colleagues introduce a system that allows the user to model physical
        objects within AR. Mann and Fung describe an approach to obscure visually
        undesirable objects to create diminished reality. Ohta and colleagues, MacIntyre
        and colleagues, and Sakagawa and colleagues report on methods for fusing the
        real world and virtual worlds. Ohta\u2019s group describes an augmented reality
        system that uses an interactively computed depth map of the real world. MacIntyre\u2019s

        "We describe a view-management component for interactive 3D user interfaces.
        By view management, we mean maintaining visual constraints on the projections
        of objects on the view plane, such as locating related objects near each other,
        or preventing objects from occluding each other. Our view-management component
        accomplishes this by modifying selected object properties, including position,
        size, and transparency, which are tagged to indicate their constraints. For
        example, some objects may have geometric properties that are determined entirely
        by a physical simulation and which cannot be modified, while other objects
        may be annotations whose position and size are flexible.We introduce algorithms
        that use upright rectangular extents to represent on the view plane a dynamic
        and efficient approximation of the occupied space containing the projections
        of visible portions of 3D objects, as well as the unoccupied space in which
        objects can be placed to avoid occlusion. Layout decisions from previous frames
        are taken into account to reduce visual discontinuities. We present augmented
        reality and virtual reality examples to which we have applied our approach,

        a Mobile Augmented Reality System", "abstract": "The position-tracking accuracy
        of a location-aware mobile system can change dynamically as a function of
        the user\u2019s location and other variables specific to the tracker technology
        used. This is especially problematic for mobile augmented reality systems,
        which ideally require extremely precise position tracking for the user\u2019s
        head, but which may not always be able to achieve the necessary level of accuracy.
        While it is possible to ignore variable positional accuracy in an augmented
        reality user interface, this can make for a confusing system; for example,
        when accuracy is low, virtual objects that are nominally registered with real
        ones may be too far off to be of use. To address this problem, we describe
        the early stages of an experimental mobile augmented reality system that adapts
        its user interface automatically to accommodate changes in tracking accuracy.
        Our system employs different technologies for tracking a user\u2019s position,
        resulting in a wide variation in positional accuracy: an indoor ultrasonic
        tracker and an outdoor real-time kinematic GPS system. For areas outside the
        range of both, we introduce a dead-reckoning approach that combines a pedometer
        and orientation tracker with environmental knowledge expressed in spatial
        maps and accessibility graphs. We present preliminary results from this approach
        in the context of a navigational guidance system that helps users to orient
        themselves in an unfamiliar environment. Our system uses inferencing and path
        planning to guide users toward targets that they choose.", "venue": "", "year":

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe authors present a system that scans electronic
        records from cardiac surgery and uses inference rules to identify and classify
        abnormal events (e.g., hypertension) that may occur during critical surgical
        points (e.g., start of bypass). This vital information is used as the content
        of automatically generated briefings designed by MAGIC, a multimedia system
        that they are developing to brief intensive care unit clinicians on patient
        status after cardiac surgery. By recognizing patterns in the patient record,
        inferences concisely summarize detailed patient data.\n\n\nDESIGN\nThe authors
        present the development of inference rules that identify important information
        about patient status and describe their implementation and an experiment they
        carried out to validate their correctness. The data for a set of 24 patients
        were analyzed independently by the system and by 46 physicians.\n\n\nMEASUREMENTS\nThe
        authors measured accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity by comparing system
        inferences against physician judgments, in cases where all three physicians
        agreed and against the majority opinion in all cases.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor laboratory
        inferences, evaluation shows that the system has an average accuracy of 98
        percent (full agreement) and 96 percent (majority model). An analysis of interrater
        agreement, however, showed that physicians do not agree on abnormal hemodynamic
        events and could not serve as a gold standard for evaluating hemodynamic events.
        Analysis of discrepancies reveals possibilities for system improvement and
        causes of physician disagreement.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis evaluation shows
        that the laboratory inferences of the system have high accuracy. The lack
        of agreement among physicians highlights the need for an objective quality-assurance
        tool for hemodynamic inferences. The system provides such a tool by implementing
        inferencing procedures established in the literature.", "venue": "J. Am. Medical

        a general approach to the dynamic representation of 2D space that is well

        full and empty. The user can explicitly specify a set of possibly overlapping
        upright rectangles that represent the objects of interest. These full-space
        rectangles are processed by the system to create a representation of the remaining
        empty space. This representation makes it easy for users to develop customized
        spatial allocation strategies that avoid overlapping the full-space rectangles.
        We describe the representation; provide efficient incremental algorithms for
        adding and deleting full-space rectangles, and for querying the empty-space
        representation; and show several allocation strategies that the representation
        makes possible. We present two testbed applications that incorporate an implementation
        of the algorithm; one shows the utility of our representation for window management
        tasks; the other applies it to the layout of components in a 3D user interface,

        "title": "Automated generation of visual discourse", "abstract": "Visual presentations
        can help us understand information better. However, handcrafting customized,
        effective visual presentations requires much skill, time and effort. To present
        information in a timely, customized manner, we develop comprehensive and systematic
        methodologies to automate the visual design process. In particular, we focus
        on automatically creating coherent, versatile, and interactive visual discourse.
        We use the term visual discourse to refer to a series of connected visual
        displays, of which a single display or a series of static displays may be
        considered as special cases. A coherent visual discourse has smooth transitions
        between displays, consistent designs within and among displays, and effective
        visual unification among various components. A versatile visual discourse
        is capable of representing a wide range of information through different visual
        media and visual techniques. An interactive visual discourse encourages and
        supports user interactivity. \nThis thesis addresses a set of research issues
        vital to the creation of coherent, versatile, and interactive visual discourse.
        We describe how to characterize presentation data, model presentation context,
        and classify presentation tasks. To equip presentation systems with visual
        design knowledge, we discuss the design and formal representation of a presentation
        design language, which covers a wide variety of visual patterns, visual techniques,
        and visual design principles at multiple levels of abstraction. We also present
        a powerful and efficient inferencing paradigm to reason about various conditions
        and infer a visual design. To demonstrate the coverage and utility of our
        research, we describe the design and implementation of a system called IMPROVISE
        (Illustrative Metaphor PROduction in VISual Environments). We have used IMPROVISE
        to automatically create coherent visual presentations in two different domains.
        In one domain, IMPROVISE is used as a stand-alone system for a computer network
        management application to provide users with cohesive visual explanations
        about network structures and behaviors. IMPROVISE is also employed as a graphics
        generation component in a collaborative effort with Columbia''s Natural Language
        Processing group and Knowledge Representation group to produce multimedia
        summaries of patient medical records, containing coordinated text, speech,
        and graphics.", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        "title": "Exploratory programming of distributed augmented environments",
        "abstract": "Augmented reality is a form of virtual reality that uses see-through
        displays to enhance the world with computer-generated material. When combined
        with more traditional displays, a powerful augmented environment emerges in
        which two and three dimensional information can be presented to a user simultaneously
        on a combination of displays. Prototyping these environments is challenging
        both because they are highly distributed, interactive systems, and because
        of the exploratory nature of building systems for new interaction paradigms.
        \nWe have developed a testbed for exploratory programming of distributed augmented
        environments, called Coterie. A single programming model is used for both
        single and multiprocess programs by building applications as groups of threads
        communicating via shared objects. The distributed programming model is distributed
        object memory (DOM), an object-based approach to distributed shared memory.
        Coterie''s DOM presents the programmer with both client-server and replicated
        distributed objects. \nBoth interpreted (Repo) and compiled (Modula-3) languages
        present the application programmer with similar DOM programming models. Modula-3''s
        replicated objects are implemented using Shared Objects, an object replication
        package that is tightly integrated with the Modula-3 object system and designed
        to be flexible and easy-to-use. Repo is implemented using the Shared Object
        package, and presents the programmer with an interpreted language that supports
        both client-server and replicated objects uniformly across its entire type
        system. The final important component of Coterie is Repo-3D, a high-level,
        distributed graphics library, built using the Shared Objects package and tightly
        integrated with Repo. By making all graphical objects extensible and transparently
        distributable, programmers can use Repo-3D scene graphs as the basis for their
        application data structures, allowing complex distributed graphical applications
        to be created in a straight-forward manner. \nNumerous stand-alone and distributed
        augmented environment systems have been developed using Coterie, and demonstrate
        its usefulness. These include an architectural anatomy system for viewing
        the support structures inside the walls of a building, a construction assistant
        for space frame buildings, a maintenance and repair task for telephone crossboxes,
        an augmented reality tour guide, and a number of interface concepts for the
        National Tele-Immersion Initiative.", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount":

        (VR) refers to a technology which is capable of shifting a subject into a
        different environment without physically moving him/her. To this end the inputs
        into the subject''s sensory organs are manipulated in such a way, that the
        perceived environment is associated with the desired Virtual Environment (VE)
        and not with the physical one. The manipulation process is controlled by a
        computer model that is based on the physical description of the VE. Consequently,
        the technology is able to create almost arbitrarily perceived environments.
        Immersion is a key issue in VR systems as it is central to the paradigm where
        the user becomes part of the simulated world, rather than the simulated world
        being a feature of the user''s own world. The first \" immersive VR systems

        mixture of real hardware and virtual imagery. The term \"immersion\" is a
        description of a technology, which can be achieved to varying degrees. A necessary
        condition is Ellis'' notion [1] of a VE, maintained in at least one sensory
        modality (typically the visual). For example, a head-mounted display with

        "A research testbed is described for exploring the automated layout of graphical
        displays. We address the problem of determining the size and position of the

        of a design grid. A design grid is a set of proportionally-spaced vertical
        and horizontal lines that control the position and size of the objects being
        laid out. The system first generates a grid intended for a set of possible
        displays, based on information about the kind of material to be displayed,
        the user, and the display hardware. The grid is next used, in conjunction
        with further information about the kinds of objects to be presented, to create
        a prototype display layout. This prototype display layout determines how each
        actual set of objects will be sized and positioned in the displays presented

        "title": "The Representation and Use of a Visual Lexicon for Automated Graphics
        Generation", "abstract": "Most automated graphics generation systems employ
        either a constructive or a parametric graphics synthesis approach. Constructive
        graphics synthesis is a deductive approach that builds visual presentations
        from scratch by gluing together the most basic visual variables. Conversely,
        parametric graphics synthesis defines a set of parametrized visual models
        and interprets the information to be presented through instantiation of the
        selected model. To increase efficiency, we have combined parametric and constructive
        approaches in a system called IMPROVISE. In this paper, we focus on the parametric
        aspect of our approach. We present a comprehensive, general, and extensible
        formalism to represent a visual lexicon for use in automated graphics generation.
        A visual lexicon is a collection of parametrized primitive visual objects
        that serve as building blocks for constructing more complex visual presentations.
        We also illustrate how this representation can be effectively employed to
        aid the selection and instantiation of a visual lexical item in the graphics
        generation process. Examples are given from IMPROVISE to demonstrate the representation
        and use of this visual lexicon.", "venue": "International Joint Conference

        "title": "Generating efficient virtual worlds for visualization using partial
        evaluation and dynamic compilation", "abstract": "We argue that runtime program
        transformation, partial evaluation, and dynamic compilation are essential
        tools for automated generation of flexible, highly interactive graphical interfaces.
        In particular, these techniques help bridge the gap between a high-level,
        functional description and an efficient implementation. To support our claim,
        we describe our application of these techniques to a functional implementation
        of n-Vision, a real-time visualization system that represents multivariate
        relations as nested 3D interactors, and to Auto Visual, a rule-based system
        that designs n-Vision visualizations from high-level task specifications.
        n-Vision visualizations are specified using a simple functional language.
        These programs are transformed into a cached dataflow graph. A partial evaluator
        is used on particular computation-intensive function applications, and the
        results are compiled to native code. The functional representation simplifies
        generation of correct code, and the program transformations ensure good performance.
        We demonstrate why these transformations improve performance and why they
        cannot be done at compile time.", "venue": "ACM SIGPLAN Workshop on Partial

        "title": "Adding insight through animation in augmented reality", "abstract":
        "Most of the virtual world systems that have been so well publicized over
        the past ten years use opaque head mounted displays that block off the wearer
        from the surrounding real world, effectively immersing her within a synthesized
        environment. These systems hold tremendous promise for certain applications
        ranging from fantasy games to scientific research. In contrast, we believe
        that the most powerful and commonplace virtual worlds of the future will not
        replace the real world, but will rather augment it with additional information.
        This approach is called augmented reality and was pioneered by Ivan Sutherland,
        who, over a quarter century ago, developed the first see-through head mounted
        display (I. Sutherland, 1968). When completed, his system presented graphics
        to the user on a pair of stereo displays, worn on the user''s head. The image
        produced by the displays was combined with the user''s view of the world using
        mirror beam splitters. A 3D tracking system determined the position and orientation
        of the user''s head. This enabled the system to change the view, based on
        the direction in which the wearer was looking.", "venue": "Proceedings Computer

        "title": "Introduction to the special issue on virtual reality software and
        technology", "abstract": "We are delighted to present this special issue containing
        extended versions of four papers selected from the 1994 Virtual Reality Software
        & Technology (VRST) conference, held August 23-26, 1994, in Singapore. Techniques
        and tools for interacting with virtual environments are at the core of research
        and development efforts around the world, and these articles provide a sampling
        of the latest advances. (A companion issue of Communications of the ACM, containing
        articles that address a broader-based audience, is also being edited.) This
        issue begins with Alan Wexelblat\u2019s article on the use of gestures in
        multimodal applications, \u201cAn Approach to Natural Gesture in Virtual Environments.\u201d
        His work uses empty-hand, continuous gestures, much like the gestures we use
        in our everyday communication with people, for interaction with virtual worlds.
        These gestures are decomposed into feature-based descriptions that serve as
        an intermediate language for gestural input. Wexelblat\u2019s prototype system
        uses several tracking devices attached to various parts of the user\u2019s
        body to collect raw data about body movement. The data are filtered and converted
        into body-relative information and sent to a gesture analyzer. The analyzer
        converts the input to a higher-level description and forwards it to the gesture
        interpreter, which assigns meaning to gestures based on the application and
        the interaction context. \u201cTaking Steps: The Influence of a Walking Technique
        on Presence in Virtual Reality,\u201d by Mel Slater, Martin Usoh, and Anthony
        Steed, presents an interactive technique for moving through immersive virtual
        worlds. When within the range of the electromagnetic tracking device used,
        the user moves around by actually walking. To cover a virtual distance that
        is larger than the tracker\u2019s physical range, the user walks in place.
        Walking in place causes the user to move forward in the direction of gaze.
        The authors also apply a modified version of this interaction technique to
        climbing up and down steps and ladders. The implementation uses a feed-forward
        neural network to construct a pattern recognize that detects whether the user
        is walking in place or doing something else. User trials show that the walking
        technique leads to a greater sense of presence, even though the users preferred
        pointing-based navigation techniques. In \u201cHoloSketch: A Virtual Reality
        Sketching/Animation Tool,\u201d Michael Deering discusses the user interface
        of a true 3D drawing system based on a \u201cfish-tank VR\u201d model: a high-resolution
        CRT, head-tracked, liquid-crystal stereo eyewear and a hand-held 3D wand interaction
        device. Unlike the majority of virtual environments, Deering\u2019s software
        and hardware infrastructure allows virtual objects to be positioned with subcentimeter
        accuracy, which is maintained even as the user\u2019s head moves. This makes
        it possible for the 3D wand to be used as a direct pointer, rather than as
        an indirect 3D", "venue": "TCHI", "year": 1995, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        "title": "8 Conclusions", "abstract": "Existing ray tracers, once given the
        rendering specifications, are not controllable by the user. The priority-driven
        ray tracing provides a mechanism to steer rendering and deliver intermediate
        images amid processing. We have demonstrated the utility of five priority
        schemes and shown that they require reasonable amounts of memory and consume
        negligible amount of overhead time. Priority-driven ray tracing can be extended
        to support other priority schemes, and mixtures of several priority criteria.
        In our current implementation, once a priority has been assigned to a ray
        it cannot be changed. The ability to demote or promote queued rays will provide
        us the support needed for dynamic steering. In addition, various other priority
        schemes can be explored. Examples include priority assigned to rays based
        on cache performance optimization [GREE89] or priority assigned to shadow
        feelers according to light source intensity or distance. Finally, we have
        used numerical methods to show the faster convergence of the priority based
        method. One could employ some perceptual metric [RUSH89] to better control
        our priority ray tracer to achieve even faster effective image comprehension.",

        "INTRODUCTION There are many situations in which pictures are needed to fulfill
        a clearly stated purpose, such as describing the results of an experiment
        or explaining how to perform a physical task . While computer graphics research
        has given us fully automated solutions to rendering pictures, the process
        of designing pictures is typically addressed through the development of editors
        with which a user can express their design decisions. Designing pictures by
        hand is time-consuming, requires scarce expertise, and invariably must be
        done in advance of when the pictures are viewed. Consequently, the results
        are often overly general and do not meet the information needs of each individual
        viewer and situation . Know/edge-based graphics offers an alternative approach

        graphic tasks, such as the manipulation of graphical objects and the construction
        of user-interface widgets, can be facilitated by geometric constraints. However,
        the difficulty of specifying constraints by traditional methods forms a barrier
        to their widespread use. In order to make constraints easier to declare, we
        have developed a method of specifying constraints implicitly, through multiple
        examples. Snapshots are taken of an initial scene configuration, and one or
        more additional snapshots are taken after the scene has been edited into other
        valid configurations. The constraints that are satisfied in all of the snapshots
        are then applied to the scene objects. We discuss an efficient algorithm for
        inferring constraints from multiple snapshots. The algorithm has been incorporated
        into the Chimera editor, and several examples of its use are discussed.",

        "title": "Graphical editing by example", "abstract": "Constructing illustrations
        by computer can be both tedious and difficult. This thesis introduces five
        example-based techniques to facilitate the process. These techniques are independently
        useful, but also interrelate in interesting ways: (1) Graphical Search and
        Replace, the analogue to textual search and replace in text editors, is useful
        for making repetitive changes throughout graphical documents. (2) Constraint-Based
        Search and Replace, an extension to graphical search and replace, allows users
        to define their own illustration beautification rules and constraint inferencing
        rules by demonstration. (3) Constraint Inferencing from Multiple Snapshots
        facilitates constraint specification by automatically computing constraints
        that hold in multiple configurations of an illustration. (4) Editable Graphical
        Histories, a visual representation of commands in a graphical user interface,
        are useful for reviewing, undoing, and redoing sets of operations. (5) Graphical
        Macros By Example, based on this history representation, allow users to scroll
        through previously executed commands and encapsulate useful sequences into
        macros. These macros can be generalized into procedures, with arguments and
        flow of control using graphical and constraint-based search and replace. \nIndividually
        and in combination, these techniques reduce repetition in graphical editing
        tasks, visually and by example, using the application''s own interface. These
        techniques have been implemented in Chimera, an editor built to serve as a

        are built, convex scene polygons are filtered down the trees, and split into
        fragments that are wholly lit, in penumbra, or in umbra. The illumination
        due to the light source is calculated at selected points within the wholly

        "When explanations include multiple media, such as text and illustrations,
        a reference to an object can be made through a combination of media. We call
        part of a presentation that references material elsewhere a cross-reference.
        We are concerned here with how textual expressions can refer to parts of accompanying
        illustrations. The illustration to which a cross-reference refers should also
        satisfy the specific goal of identifying an object for the user. Thus, producing
        an effective cross-reference not only involves text generation, but may also
        entail modifying or replacing an existing illustration and in some cases,
        generating an illustration where previously none was needed. In this paper,
        we describe the different types of cross-references that COMET (COordinated
        Multimedia Explanation Testbed) generates and show the roles that both its
        text and graphics generators play in this process.", "venue": "AAAI Conference

        alternative to conventional interfaces, the technologies these systems currently
        use do not provide sufficient resolution and accuracy to support detailed
        work such as text editing. We describe a pragmatic approach to interface design
        that provides users with a large virtual world in which such high-resolution
        work can be performed. Our approach is based on combining heterogeneous display
        and interaction device technologies to produce a hybrid user interface. Display
        and interaction technologies that have relatively low resolution, but which
        cover a wide (visual and interactive) field are used to form an information
        surround. Display and interaction technologies that have relatively high resolution
        over a limited visual and interaction range are used to present concentrated
        information in one or more selected portions of the surround. These high-resolution
        fields are embedded within the low-resolution surround by choosing and coordinating
        complementary devices that permit the user to see and interact with both simultaneously.
        This allows each embedded high-resolution interface to serve as a \u201csweet
        spot\u201d within which intonation may be preferentially processed, We have

        The IGD (Interactive Graphical Documents) hypermedia system was designed to
        make possible interactive presentations that can be explored by and customized
        for individual users. We describe IGD\u2019s authoring facilities through
        an annotated excerpt from an editing session, emphasizing how the system\u2019s
        document model and user interface help support the creation of large documents.
        Although we feel that IGD successfully addressed some of the issues of scale,
        experience with the system has convinced us that it is wrong to cast many
        of the problems of authoring large hypertexts as ones that can be solved by
        implementing editors of sufficient scope and sophistication. We believe that
        hypertext design systems based on direct editing of documents inherit many
        of the bottlenecks associated with the conventional document authoring process.
        These problems are compounded by the added intellectual burden of designing
        a connective structure of keyworded links. We contrast the reality of the
        author-centered, editor-based approach to document design and layout, exemplified
        by IGD, with the promise of a knowledge-based, automated alternative, and
        discuss why we feel that many of the facilities provided by IGD will still
        be useful even if presentations can be created entirely automatically.", "venue":

        how to express it at the time of generation. A brief overview of COMET''s

        Command histories are an important component of good user interfaces [3].
        They allow users to review sequences of previously executed commands, and
        can provide an interface to an undo facility. Furthermore, they can support
        either a simple redo mechanism, or a more sophisticated macro-by-demonstration
        capability. Providing a visual representation of command histories in a graphical
        user interface presents a number of difficulties. Editable graphical histories
        [1, 2], a history representation that we have developed based on a comic-strip
        metaphor, overcomes many of these. Here we describe editable graphical histories,

        An illustrution is a picture that is designed to fulfill a communicative intent

        An illustration is generated by implementing a set of stylistic decisions,
        ranging from determining the way in which an individual object is lit, to
        deciding the general composition of the illustration. The design of an illustration
        is treated as a goal-driven process within a system of constraints. The goal
        is to achieve communicative intent; the constraints are the illustrative techniques
        an illustrator can apply.We have developed IBIS (Intent-Based Illustration
        System), a system that puts these ideas into practice. IBIS designs illustrations
        using a generate-and-test approach, relying upon a rule-based system of methods
        and evaluators. Methods are rules that specify how to accomplish visual effects,

        "Much research in computer animation has concentrated on motion planning,
        ranging from high-level script design to low-level specification of how each
        character moves. Generating an animated presentation, however, also requires
        decisions about camera planning, the selection of what material should be
        shown and how it should be ordered, the maintenance of visual continuity,
        and viewport selection. If the presentation is to communicate informa,tion
        coherently, these decisions must be based in part on knowledge about the content
        domain and about filmmaking techniques. In this paper, we describe some of
        the principal techniques for generating good animated presentations, and point
        out some of the issues in developing systems that could apply these techniques
        automatically. Some of these issues are illustrated with examples made using
        ESPLANADE (Expert System for PLANning Animation Design and Editing) , a rule-based
        test bed that we are developing for exploring the automated generation of

        containing functions of an arbitrary number of variables. Although our interaction
        devices and display hardware are inherently 3D, we demonstrate how they can
        be used to support interaction with these higher-dimensional objects. We introduce
        a new interaction metaphor developed for the system, which we call \u201cworlds
        within worlds\u201d: nested heterogeneous coordinate systems that allow the
        user to view and manipulate functions. Objects in our world may be explored
        with a set of tools. We describe an example n-Vision application in \u201cfinancial
        visualization,\u201d where the functions are models of financial instruments.
        n-Vision\u2019s software architecture supports a hierarchy of arbitrarily
        transformed, nested boxes that defines an interactive space within which information
        is displayed and input obtained. Our design, modeled in part after the hierarchical
        2D windows of the X Window System, is intended to provide an environment that
        is well suited to the use of true 3D input and stereo display devices. Boxes
        are associated with event handlers that support 3D motion, enter, and leave
        events, and provide recognition of finger gestures. CR", "venue": "ACM Symposium

        paper describes an object-space shadow generation algorithm for static polygonal
        environments illuminated by movable point light sources. The algorithm can
        be easily implemented on any graphics system that provides fast polygon scan-conversion
        and achieves near real-time performance for environments of modest size. It
        combines elements of two kinds of current shadow generation algorithms: two-pass
        object-space approaches and shadow volume approaches. For each light source
        a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree is constructed that represents the
        shadow volume of the polygons facing it. As each polygon''s contribution to
        a light source''s shadow volume is determined, the polygon''s shadowed and
        lit fragments are computed by filtering it down the shadow volume BSP tree.
        The polygonal scene with its computed shadows can be rendered with any polygon-based
        visible-surface algorithm. Since the shadow volumes and shadows are computed
        in object space, they can be used for further analysis of the scene. Pseudocode
        is provided, along with pictures and timings from an interactive implementation.",

        "To generate multimedia explanations, a system must be able to coordinate
        the use of different media in a single explanation. In this paper, we present
        the architecture that we have developed for COMET (COordinated Multimedia
        Explanation Testbed), a system that generates directions for equipment maintenance
        and repair, and we show how it addresses the coordination problem. COMET includes
        a single content planner that produces a common content description used by
        multiple media-specific generators, and a media coordinator that performs
        a fine-grained division of information among media. Bidirectional interaction
        between media-specific generators allows influence across media. We describe
        COMET''s current capabilities and provide an overview of our plans for extending
        the system.", "venue": "Human Language Technology - The Baltic Perspectiv",

        specification into an interface built using a window system, an associated
        user interface toolkit, and the hardware input devices available on the system.
        The rules match application requirements against a semantic description of
        the toolkit, selecting virtual devices for input, output, and layout. Thus,
        Scope uses design rules to create interfaces from high-level programming semantics

        explanation generation system. It has access to a knowledge base that contains
        a collection of objects, including information about their geometric properties,
        material, and location. As the goals are interpreted by a rule-based control
        component, the system generates a precise definition of the final illustration.
        If IBIS determines that a set of goals cannot be satisfied in a single picture,
        then it attempts to create a composite illustration that has multiple viewports.
        For example, a composite illustration may contain a nested inset illustration
        showing an object in greater detail than is possible in the parent picture.
        Each component illustration is defined by its placement, size, viewing specification,

        extremely difficult and time-consuming. Moreover, the combination of increasing
        task complexity and declining job skills makes the need for high-quality technical
        presentations especially urgent. We believe that this need can ultimately
        be met through the development of knowledge-based graphical interfaces that
        can design and present technical information. Since much material is most
        naturally communicated through pictures, our work has stressed the importance
        of well-designed graphics, concentrating on generating pictures and laying
        out displays containing them. We describe APEX, a testbed picture generation
        system that creates sequences of pictures that depict the performance of simple
        actions in a world of 3D objects. Our system supports rules for determining
        automatically the objects to be shown in a picture, the style and level of
        detail with which they should be rendered, the method by which the action
        itself should be indicated, and the picture''s camera specification. We then
        describe work on GRIDS, an experimental display layout system that addresses
        some of the problems in designing displays containing these pictures, determining

        much work has been done on planning and generating textual explanations, relatively
        little attention has been devoted to automating the design of pictures that
        could be used to explain things. This thesis presents a three part conceptual
        architecture for generating pictorial explanations, such as maintenance and
        repair manuals, in which pictures play a crucial role. One part determines
        the material to be presented, for example, the solution to a maintenance and
        repair task. A second part plans the explanation, determines the spatial and
        temporal layout of the displays, and designs the pictures and text. A third
        part interfaces to rendering and typesetting software that scan-converts the
        displays. \nAPEX (Automated Pictorial EXplanations) is a partial testbed implementation
        of the architecture. It can generate sequences of pictures that show how to
        perform simple actions, such as turning or pulling, in a world of 3D objects.
        Each picture crystallizes around those objects that participate directly in
        the action being depicted. Whether additional objects will be included and
        how they will be rendered are determined by the relationships that the objects
        bear to those already in the picture. For example, an object that is similar
        to one of the participating objects is added with enough detail to disambiguate
        it and is drawn with a rendering style intended to mark it as less important.
        \nAlthough APEX needs to depict objects at varying levels of detail, the original
        object database is a hierarchy with physical objects located only at the leaves.
        Selective display of leaves, however, will not produce effective pictures.
        A method for controlling the level of detail in a picture is presented in
        which the object hierarchy is processed to yield one whose internal nodes
        are associated with automatically created approximations of their children.
        Decisions made during the picture design process control the depth to which
        different parts of this hierarchy are traversed, determining the level of
        detail with which each part is rendered.", "venue": "", "year": 1987, "referenceCount":

        can be used in a similar way. Minor adjustments may be required for some algorithms.
        For example, if Teller and Funkhouser''s cell intervisibility precalculation
        is used [19, 41], then occlusions of dynamic objects by static scenery can
        easily be utilized, but occlusions by dynamic objects are harder to detect.
        Other occlusion culling techniques may be even harder to adapt to dynamic
        scenes. For example, in a static scene, the set of objects seen from each
        region of viewpoints in space can simply be found by brute force at preprocessing,
        and stored for use at runtime; however, the generalization of this method
        to dynamic scenes is not simple, and might even be less efficient than rendering
        the whole model without any occlusion culling. The TBVs used in this research
        are \" flat, \" in the sense that each is related to a single object (usually
        composed of numerous primitives). An alternative that can be explored is to
        employ hierarchical TBVs, i.e. temporal bounding volumes that contain, in
        turn, other volumes, thus relating to more than one object. This may have
        some advantages in certain cases, e.g. when the dynamic objects tend to stay
        in clusters rather than being evenly spread through space. As mentioned above,
        one of the main advantages of dynamic scene occlusion culling is that it saves
        unneeded updates of unseen dynamic objects. It thus harnesses the power of
        occlusion culling to reduce the number of object update messages, which can
        potetially be very time-consuming in distributed environments. Another possible
        direction of future research is the combination this message reduction method
        with other techniques, such as dead reckoning. The same general idea may also
        be applied to level-of-detail control: update messages for distant objects
        with small screen projections can be sent less frequently than for apparently
        large objects. In conclusion, the rich body of work on 3D graphics optimization
        includes a lot of techniques that were originally developed with static scenes
        in mind. The generalization of these techniques to dynamic scenes is not always
        simple, but it is definitely \u2026", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":

        Kinetic binary space partitions for intersecting segments and disjoint triangles.
        BSP tree projection. Different culling algorithms can be used in a similar
        way. Minor adjustments may be required for some algorithms. For example, if
        Teller and Funkhouser''s cell intervisibility precalculation is used [19,
        41], then occlusions of dynamic objects by static scenery can easily be utilized,
        but occlusions by dynamic objects are harder to detect. Other occlusion culling
        techniques may be even harder to adapt to dynamic scenes. For example, in
        a static scene, the set of objects seen from each region of viewpoints in
        space can simply be found by brute force at preprocessing, and stored for
        use at runtime; however, the generalization of this method to dynamic scenes
        is not simple, and might even be less efficient than rendering the whole model
        without any occlusion culling. The TBVs used in this research are \" flat,
        \" in the sense that each is related to a single object (usually composed
        of numerous primitives). An alternative that can be explored is to employ
        hierarchical TBVs, i.e. temporal bounding volumes that contain, in turn, other
        volumes, thus relating to more than one object. This may have some advantages
        in certain cases, e.g. when the dynamic objects tend to stay in clusters rather
        than being evenly spread through space. As mentioned above, one of the main
        advantages of dynamic scene occlusion culling is that it saves unneeded updates
        of unseen dynamic objects. It thus harnesses the power of occlusion culling
        to reduce the number of object update messages, which can potetially be very
        time-consuming in distributed environments. Another possible direction of
        future research is the combination this message reduction method with other
        techniques, such as dead reckoning. The same general idea may also be applied
        to level-of-detail control: update messages for distant objects with small
        screen projections can be sent less frequently than for apparently large objects.
        In conclusion, the rich body of work on 3D graphics optimization includes
        a lot of techniques that were originally developed with static scenes in mind.
        The generalization of these techniques to dynamic scenes is not always simple,
        but it is definitely \u2026", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":
