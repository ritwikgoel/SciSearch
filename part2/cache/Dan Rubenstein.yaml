        "title": "Traffic Prediction on the Internet", "abstract": "Large swings in
        the demand for content are commonplace within the Internet. To service this
        demand adequately without over-provisioning requires that the number of servers
        processing requests be adjusted dynamically with the demand. Since such adjustments
        require negotiation and the transfer of data across a distributed network,
        there is a time lag between the decision to adjust and the availability of
        increased capacity. Failure to perform such adjustments sufficiently in advance
        can lead to service degradation or even denial of service for a large number
        of requests. Hence, with enough advance notice, knowledge of future traffic
        levels can lead to significant improvements in service quality. Performing
        accurate predictions appears to be a daunting challenge at first glance, but
        this paper shows that, when applied to Internet traffic, even elementary prediction
        techniques can have a surprising forecasting power. Our analysis of several
        different Internet traces reveals that server overloads can often be seen
        well in advance. This allows steps to be taken to reduce substantially the
        degradation of service quality. We discuss various systems, such as server
        and peer-to-peer cooperatives, where traffic predictors (even imperfect ones)
        can be used to great advantage in reducing latencies and improving resilience
        to hotspots, whether they be caused by flash crowds, failures in routers,
        links, etc., and whether they be innocent in origin or produced by vandals
        or terrorists.", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount":

        "title": "Bandwidth Allocation Games", "abstract": "Internet providers often
        offer data plans that, for each user''s monthly billing cycle, guarantee a
        fixed amount of data at high rates until a byte threshold is reached, at which
        point the user''s data rate is throttled to a lower rate for the remainder
        of the cycle. In practice, the thresholds and rates of throttling can appear
        and may be somewhat arbitrary. In this paper, we evaluate the choice of threshold
        and rate as an optimization problem (regret minimization) and demonstrate
        that intuitive formulations of client regret, which preserve desirable fairness
        properties, lead to optimization problems that have tractably computable solutions.
        We begin by exploring the effectiveness of using thresholding mechanisms to
        modulate overall bandwidth consumption. Next, we separately consider the regret
        of heterogeneous users who are {\\em streamers}, wishing to view content over
        a finite period of fixed rates, and users who are {\\em file downloaders},
        desiring a fixed amount of bandwidth per month at their highest obtainable
        rate. We extend our analysis to a game-theoretic setting where users can choose
        from a variety of plans that vary the cap on the unbounded-rate data, and
        demonstrate the convergence of the game. Our model provides a fresh perspective
        on a fair allocation of resources where the demand is higher than capacity,
        while focusing on the real-world phenomena of bandwidth throttling practiced
        by ISPs. We show how the solution to the optimization problem results in allocations
        that exhibit several desirable fairness properties among the users between
        whom the capacity must be partitioned.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2022,

        computing is an attractive cloud services paradigm, simultaneously promising
        reduced cost and greater flexibility for customers and increased revenues
        and higher resource utilization for cloud providers. In this paper, we present
        an analysis of the potential cost benefits of serverless computing for end
        customers and cloud providers. Using realistic cost models, queueing theoretic
        performance models, and a game theoretic formulation, we explore the tradeoffs
        between serverless computing (SC) and traditional cloud computing (virtual
        machine, VM). In the proposed framework, customers distribute their workload
        between SC and VM to minimize their cost while maintaining a particular performance
        constraint, while the cloud provider sets SC and VM prices to maximize its
        profit. We explore the impact of relative prices, customer workload, service
        capacity, and provider costs. Our main result is the identification and characterization
        of three optimal operational regimes for both customers and the provider that
        leverage either SC or VM only, or both, in a hybrid configuration. The various

        dominant means for home Internet access, yet is frequently a performance bottleneck.
        Without reliable, satisfactory performance at the last hop, end-to-end quality
        of service (QoS) efforts will fail. Three major reasons for WiFi bottlenecking
        performance are its: 1) inherent wireless channel characteristics, 2) approach
        to access control of the shared broadcast channel, and 3) impact on transport
        layer protocols, such as TCP, that operate end-to-end, and over-react to the
        loss or delay caused by the single WiFi link. In this paper, we leverage the
        philosophy of centralization in modern networking and present our cross layer

        at the point of entry/egress into the WiFi network. Based on network conditions

        the optimal utility. Unlike most existing WiFi QoS approaches, our design

        "Object tracking applications are gaining popularity and will soon utilize
        Energy Harvesting (EH) low-power nodes that will consume power mostly for
        Neighbor Discovery (ND) (i.e., identifying nodes within communication range).
        Although ND protocols were developed for sensor networks, the challenges posed
        by emerging EH low-power transceivers were not addressed. Therefore, we design
        an ND protocol tailored for the characteristics of a representative EH prototype:
        the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH. We present a generalized model of ND accounting for
        unique prototype characteristics (i.e., energy costs for transmission/reception,
        and transceiver state switching times/costs). Then, we present the Power Aware
        Neighbor Discovery Asynchronously (Panda) protocol in which nodes transition
        between the sleep, receive, and transmit states. We analyze Panda and select
        its parameters to maximize the ND rate subject to a homogeneous power budget.
        We also present Panda-D, designed for non-homogeneous EH nodes. We perform
        extensive testbed evaluations using the prototypes and study various design
        tradeoffs. We demonstrate a small difference (less then 2%) between experimental

        "abstract": "Wireless object tracking applications are gaining popularity
        and will soon utilize emerging ultra-low-power device-to-device communication.
        However, severe energy constraints require much more careful accounting of
        energy usage than what prior art provides. In particular, the available energy,
        the differing power consumption levels for listening, receiving, and transmitting,
        as well as the limited control bandwidth must all be considered. Therefore,
        we formulate the problem of maximizing the throughput among a set of heterogeneous
        broadcasting nodes with differing power consumption levels, each subject to
        a strict ultra-low-power budget. We obtain the oracle throughput (i.e., maximum
        throughput achieved by an oracle) and use Lagrangian methods to design EconCast
        - a simple asynchronous distributed protocol in which nodes transition between
        sleep, listen, and transmit states, and dynamically change the transition
        rates. We also show that EconCast approaches the oracle throughput. The performance
        is evaluated numerically and via extensive simulations and it is shown that
        EconCast outperforms prior art by 6x - 17x under realistic assumptions. Finally,
        we implement EconCast using the TI eZ430-RF2500-SEH energy harvesting nodes
        and experimentally show that in realistic environments it obtains 57% - 77%
        of the achievable throughput.", "venue": "Conference on Emerging Network Experiment

        peer-to-peer (P2P) and adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming for video-on-demand
        (VoD). While P2P for VoD and ABR have been proposed previously, they have
        not been studied together because they attempt to tackle problems with seemingly
        orthogonal goals. We motivate our approach through analysis that overcomes
        a misconception resulting from prior analytical work, and show that the popularity
        of a P2P swarm and seed staying time has a significant bearing on the achievable
        per-receiver download rate. Specifically, our analysis shows that popularity
        affects swarm efficiency when seeds stay \u201clong enough\u201d. We also
        show that ABR in a P2P setting helps viewers achieve higher playback rates
        and/or fewer interruptions. We develop the Joint-Family protocol based on
        the observations from our analysis. Peers in Joint-Family simultaneously participate
        in multiple swarms to exchange chunks of different bitrates. We adopt chunk,
        bitrate, and peer selection policies that minimize occurrence of interruptions
        while delivering high quality video and improving the efficiency of the system.
        Using traces from a large-scale commercial VoD service, we compare Joint-Family
        with existing approaches for P2P VoD and show that viewers in Joint-Family
        enjoy higher playback rates with minimal interruption, irrespective of video

        allocation [7, 4] and pricing [13, 1, 12] for network resources, e.g., bandwidth,
        have been studied extensively during the last decade. Among various proposed
        pricing and allocation mechanisms, the Kelly mechanism [7] stands out as a
        simple and scalable solution. Kelly et al [7, 6] first showed that it can
        be used as a congestion pricing mechanism to achieve proportional fairness.
        However, Johari and Tsisiklis [4] found that the resource allocation from
        the Kelly mechanism might induce an efficiency loss up to 25% of the social
        optimality. In this paper, we generalize the Kelly mechanism by designing
        a build-in price differentiation and show that the efficiency gap can be closed.
        In particular, we analyze the resource competition game under the generalized
        mechanism and show that any price differentiation induces a unique Nash equilibrium.
        We further reveal the relationship between the price differentiation and its
        resulting resource allocations and derive the optimal condition under which
        the social welfare reaches maximum. Our generalization extends the flexibility
        of the Kelly mechanism in two very different ways. First, it allows autonomous
        resource owners to use price differentiations so as to achieve individual
        objectives. Second, it provides a method for altruistic resource owners to
        make tradeoffs between user fairness (in terms of price differentiation) and
        system efficiency (in terms of social welfare).", "venue": "PERV", "year":

        "Clouds commonly store Virtual Machine (VM) images on networked storage. This
        poses a serious potential scalability bottleneck as launching a single fresh
        VM instance requires, at minimum, several hundred MB of network reads. As
        this bottleneck occurs most severely during read-intensive launching of new
        VMs, we focus on scalably minimizing time to boot a VM and load its critical
        applications.\n While effective scalable P2P streaming techniques for Video
        on Demand (VOD) scenarios where blocks arrive in-order and at constant rate
        are available, no techniques address scalable large-executable streaming.
        VM execution is non-deterministic, divergent, variable rate, and cannot miss
        blocks. VMTORRENT introduces a novel combination of block prioritization,
        profile-based execution prefetch, on-demand fetch, and decoupling of VM image
        presentation from underlying data-stream. VMTORRENT provides the first complete
        and effective solution to this growing scalability problem that is based on
        making better use of existing capacity, instead of throwing more hardware
        at it.\n Supported by analytic modeling, we present comprehensive experimental
        evaluation of VMTORRENT on real systems at scale, demonstrating the effectiveness
        of VMTORRENT. We find that VMTORRENT supports comparable execution time to
        that achieved using local disk. VMTORRENT maintains this performance while
        scaling to 100 instances, providing up to 11x speedup over current state-of-the-art
        and 30x over traditional network storage.", "venue": "Conference on Emerging

        mobility", "abstract": "We explore distributed mechanisms for maintaining
        the physical layer connectivity of a mobile wireless network while still permitting
        significant area coverage. Moreover, we require that these mechanisms maintain
        connectivity despite the unpredictable wireless propagation behavior found
        in complex real-world environments. To this end, we propose the Spreadable
        Connected Autonomic Network (SCAN) algorithm, a fully distributed, on-line,
        low overhead mechanism for maintaining the connectivity of a mobile wireless
        network. SCAN leverages knowledge of the local (2-hop) network topology to
        enable each node to intelligently halt its own movement and thereby avoid
        network partitioning events. By relying on topology data instead of locality
        information and deterministic connectivity models, SCAN can be applied in
        a wide range of realistic operational environments. We believe it is for precisely
        this reason that, to our best knowledge, SCAN was the first such approach
        to be implemented in hardware. Here, we present results from our implementation
        of SCAN, finding that our mobile robotic testbed maintains full connectivity
        over 99% of the time. Moreover, SCAN achieves this in a complex indoor environment,

        internet service providers", "abstract": "Internet service providers (ISPs)
        depend on one another to provide global network services. However, the profit-seeking
        nature of the ISPs leads to selfish behaviors that result in inefficiencies
        and disputes in the network. This concern is at the heart of the \"network
        neutrality\" debate, which also asks for an appropriate compensation structure
        that satisfies all types of ISPs. Our previous work showed in a general network
        model that the Shapley value has several desirable properties, and that if
        applied as the profit model, selfish ISPs would yield globally optimal routing
        and interconnecting decisions. In this paper, we use a more detailed and realistic
        network model with three classes of ISPs: content, transit, and eyeball. This
        additional detail enables us to delve much deeper into the implications of
        a Shapley settlement mechanism. We derive closed-form Shapley values for more
        structured ISP topologies and develop a dynamic programming procedure to compute
        the Shapley values under more diverse Internet topologies. We also identify
        the implications on the bilateral compensation between ISPs and the pricing

        "abstract": "Upon arriving at an incident site in the wake of a terrorist
        attack or a natural disaster, structures specialists from FEMA\u2019s Urban
        Search and Rescue (US&R) program are tasked with ensuring the structural stability
        of partially collapsed buildings. Successful building stabilization limits
        the risk to first responders as they strive to find and remove trapped victims,
        so it is vitally important that these specialists know immediately when changes
        occur within a structural system. To enhance the effectiveness of current
        search and rescue methods while offering first responders a safer operational
        environment, low-cost wireless sensors can be used to provide real-time structural
        health monitoring (SHM) data that speaks to the current condition and stability
        of a partially collapsed structure. In this paper, a new wireless solution
        is proposed for US&R\u2019s structural specialists. The architectural design
        of this wireless system is decomposed into two functional layers. The first
        layer consists of ultra low-power wireless sensors and is used to physically
        sense the behavior of the monitored structure and track the location of any
        first responders working within. The second layer contains more sophisticated
        wireless nodes that make automated decisions about the health of the damaged
        structure and relay this information to the relevant decision makers. The
        resulting system represents a low-cost, low-power, easy to deploy SHM solution
        for US&R. In addition to supporting an array of application-specific sensing
        transducers, this system transmits processed SHM information directly to trained
        structures specialists. Additionally, this system integrates an energy-aware
        multi-hop forwarding mechanism to maximize the lifetime of the monitoring
        system as a whole and utilizes routing and information coding techniques that
        are robust to node and/or communication failures, sudden changes in device

        object networking", "abstract": "This article presents the design challenges
        posed by a new class of ultra-low-power devices referred to as Energy-Harvesting
        Active Networked Tags (EnHANTs). EnHANTs are small, flexible, and self-reliant
        (in terms of energy) devices that can be attached to objects that are traditionally
        not networked (e.g., books, furniture, walls, doors, toys, keys, produce,
        and clothing). EnHANTs will enable the Internet of Things by providing the
        infrastructure for various novel tracking applications. Examples of these
        applications include locating misplaced items, continuous monitoring of objects,
        and determining locations of disaster survivors. Recent advances in ultra-low-power
        circuit design, ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless communications, and organic
        energy harvesting techniques will enable the realization of EnHANTs in the
        near future. The harvesting components and the ultra-low-power physical layer
        have special characteristics whose implications on the higher layers have
        yet to be studied (e.g., when using UWB communications, the energy required
        to receive a bit is significantly higher than the energy required to transmit
        a bit). In this article, we describe paradigm shifts associated with technologies
        that enable EnHANTs and demonstrate their implications on higher-layer protocols.
        Moreover, we describe some of the components we have designed for EnHANTs.

        link-level measurements", "abstract": "The quality of wireless links is inherently
        dynamic, and this often makes the measurements of link delivery probabilities
        inaccurate over short timescales. We present Stable Opportunistic Routing
        (SOR), which improves unicast throughput for wireless mesh routing in the
        presence of inaccurate link-level measurements. In essence, SOR integrates
        two key features of prior approaches: (i) nodes trigger or suppress transmissions
        by inferring the actual reception of packets by neighboring nodes through
        channel overhearing, and (ii) nodes use network coding to avoid redundant
        transmissions. In addition, SOR is less dependent on accurate timing estimates
        or measured loss rates than prior approaches. Our stance is to argue that
        by carefully incorporating prior approaches into the design space of SOR,
        we can make opportunistic routing more robust toward link-level measurement
        errors, a practical issue in wireless mesh routing. Using nsclick simulation,
        we show that SOR has higher throughput than existing shortest-path and opportunistic
        routing protocols in large-scale networks, and the performance gain is more

        service providers (ISPs) depend on one another to provide global network services.
        Within the current Internet, autonomous ISPs implement bilateral settlements,
        with each ISP establishing contracts that suit its own local objective to
        maximize its profit. However, the profit-seeking nature of the ISPs leads
        to selfish behaviors that result in inefficiencies and disputes in the network.
        \nFrom a macroscopic view, this concern is at the heart of the network neutrality
        debate, which argues whether content-based service differentiation should
        be allowed on the Internet. It asks for an appropriate compensation structure
        to resolve ISP disputes as well as to provide an efficient and well-connected
        network. From a microscopic view, this concern manifests in ISP selfish routing
        strategies and discriminatory interconnections, which limit the stability
        of routes, discourage potentially useful connectivity and deteriorate performance
        and profit of the network. \nIn this dissertation, we study the use of Shapley
        value, which is originated from coalition game theory, as a profit-sharing
        mechanism to make ISP settlements. From a macroscopic view, we model a detailed
        and realistic network with three classes of ISPs: content, transit, and eyeball,
        as well as two types of user demand: elastic and inelastic. We derive closed-form
        Shapley values for structured ISP topologies and develop a dynamic programming
        procedure to compute the Shapley values under more diverse Internet topologies.
        From a microscopic view, we model a generic network with three layers of ISP
        decisions: interconnecting, routing and financial settlement. We re-design
        the current bilateral financial settlements by a clean-slate multi-lateral
        profit-sharing mechanism based on the Shapley value. We show that if the Shapley
        profit-distribution is enforced at a global level, then ISPs'' selfish interconnecting
        and routing strategies will converge to a Nash equilibrium, at which these
        individual strategies maximize the aggregate network profit and encourage
        ISP connectivity so as to limit Internet balkanization. From a practical point
        of view, we explore our results'' implication on the appropriate bilateral
        settlements between ISPs and the pricing structures for differentiated services.
        We conclude that our Shapley framework provides an ideal guideline and/or
        benchmark for solving disputes between ISPs and for building regulatory protocols

        "title": "On Resource Management for Cloud Users: A Generalized Kelly Mechanism
        Approach", "abstract": "Cloud computing provides network software companies
        with a platform to develop Software as a Service (SaaS) applications. The
        pay-as-you-go pricing model unties these SaaS providers from large capital
        outlays in hardware deployment and maintenance. Depending on the level of
        virtualization and service abstraction, cloud vendors provide different functionalities
        to the SaaS providers. For example, with a high-level service abstraction,
        Google AppEngine can provide automatic scalability for web applications; however,
        it cannot support general-purpose applications and does not give service controls
        for the SaaS providers. On the other hand, Amazon EC2 provides a low-level
        virtualization that allows for general-purpose applications. Nevertheless,
        it cannot scale the applications automatically for SaaS providers. Moreover,
        managing the computing resources for SaaS processes can also be challenging
        for a SaaS provider. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical framework
        for resource management for Saas providers so they can efficiently control
        the service levels of their users, and as to easily scale their applications
        under dynamic user arrivals/departures. Our resource bidding and allocation
        framework can be viewed as a generalization of the Kelly mechanism. Previous
        work showed that the efficiency loss of the Kelly mechanism is bounded by
        25% of the optimal social welfare. By using a built-in penalty differentiation,
        our mechanism is able to close the efficiency gap. To achieve this efficiency,
        a feedback control mechanism is proposed to maximize the aggregate valuation
        of users.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount":

        "title": "Opportunistic use of client repeaters to improve performance of
        WLANs", "abstract": "Currently deployed IEEE 802.11 WLANs (Wi-Fi networks)
        share access point (AP) bandwidth on a per-packet basis. However, various
        stations communicating with the AP often have different signal qualities,
        resulting in different transmission rates. This induces a phenomenon known
        as the rate anomaly problem, in which stations with lower signal quality transmit
        at lower rates and consume a significant majority of airtime, thereby dramatically
        reducing the throughput of stations transmitting at higher rates.\n We propose
        SoftRepeater, a practical, deployable system in which stations cooperatively
        address the rate anomaly problem. Specifically, higher rateWi-Fi stations
        opportunistically transform themselves into repeaters for lower rate stations
        when transmitting data to/from the AP. The key challenge is to determine when
        it is beneficial to enable the repeater functionality. In view of this, we
        propose an initiation protocol that ensures that repeater functionality is
        enabled only when appropriate. Also, our system can run directly on top of
        today''s 802.11 infrastructure networks. In addition, we describe a novel,
        zero-overhead network coding scheme that further alleviates undesirable symptoms
        of the rate anomaly problem. Using simulation and testbed implementation,
        we find that SoftRepeater can improve cumulative throughput by up to 200%.",

        "title": "Challenge: ultra-low-power energy-harvesting active networked tags
        (EnHANTs)", "abstract": "This paper presents the design challenges posed by
        a new class of ultra-low-power devices referred to as Energy-Harvesting Active
        Networked Tags (EnHANTs). EnHANTs are small, flexible, and self-reliant (in
        terms of energy devices that can be attached to objects that are traditionally
        not networked (e.g., books, clothing, and produce), thereby providing the
        infrastructure for various novel tracking applications. Examples of these
        applications include locating misplaced items, continuous monitoring of objects
        (items in a store, boxes in transit), and determining locations of disaster
        survivors. Recent advances in ultra-low-power wireless communications, ultra-wideband
        (UWB) circuit design, and organic electronic harvesting techniques will enable
        the realization of EnHANTs in the near future. In order for EnHANTs to rely
        on harvested energy, they have to spend significantly less energy than Bluetooth,
        Zigbee, and IEEE 802.15.4a devices. Moreover, the harvesting components and
        the ultra-low-power physical layer have special characteristics whose implications
        on the higher layers have yet to be studied (e.g., when using ultra-low-power
        circuits, the energy required to receive a bit is an order of magnitude higher
        than the energy required to transmit a bit). These special characteristics
        pose several new cross-layer research problems. In this paper, we describe
        the design challenges at the layers above the physical layer, point out relevant
        research directions, and outline possible starting points for solutions.",

        "Aloha and its slotted variation are commonly deployed medium access control
        (MAC) protocols in environments where multiple transmitting devices compete
        for a medium, yet may have difficulty sensing each other''s presence (the
        \"hidden terminal problem''''). Competing 802.11 gateways, as well as most
        modern digital cellular systems, like GSM, are examples. This paper models
        and evaluates the throughput that can be achieved in a system where nodes
        compete for bandwidth using a generalized version of slotted-Aloha protocols.
        The protocol is implemented as a two-state system, where the probability that
        a node transmits in a given slot depends on whether the node''s prior transmission
        attempt was successful. Using Markov models, we evaluate the channel utilization
        and fairness of this class of protocols for a variety of node objectives,
        including maximizing aggregate throughput of the channel, each node selfishly
        maximizing its own throughput, and attacker nodes attempting to jam the channel.
        If all nodes are selfish and strategically attempt to maximize their own throughput,
        a situation similar to the traditional Prisoner''s Dilemma arises. Our results
        reveal that under heavy loads, a greedy strategy reduces the utilization,
        and that attackers cannot do much better than attacking during randomly selected
        slots.", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

        "abstract": "A limitation of existing P2P VoD services is their inability
        to support efficient streamed access to niche content that has relatively
        small demand. This limitation stems from the poor performance of P2P when
        the number of peers sharing the content is small. In this paper, we propose
        a new providermanaged P2P VoD framework for efficient delivery of niche content
        based on two principles: reserving small portions of peers\u2019 storage and
        upload resources, as well as using novel, weighed caching techniques. We demonstrate
        through analytical analysis, simulations, and experiments on planetlab that
        our architecture can provide high streaming quality for niche content. In
        particular, we show that our architecture increases the catalog size by up
        to 40% compared to standard P2P VoD systems, and that a weighted cache policy
        can reduce the startup delay for niche content by a factor of more than three.",

        nature of the ISPs leads to selfish behaviors that result in inefficiencies

        that satisfies all types of ISPs. Our previous work showed in a general network

        WLANs", "abstract": "Currently deployed IEEE 802.11 WLANs (Wi-Fi networks)
        share access point (AP) bandwidth on a per-packet basis. However, various
        stations communicating with the AP often have different signal qualities,
        resulting in different transmission rates. This induces a phenomenon known
        as the rate anomaly problem, in which stations with lower signal quality transmit
        at lower rates and consume a significant majority of airtime, thereby dramatically
        reducing the throughput of stations transmitting at higher rates. We propose
        SoftRepeater, a practical, deployable system in which stations cooperatively
        address the rate anomaly problem. Specifically, higher rate Wi-Fi stations
        opportunistically transform themselves into repeaters for lower rate stations
        when transmitting data to/from the AP. The key challenge is to determine when
        it is beneficial to enable the repeater functionality. In view of this, we
        propose an initiation protocol that ensures that repeater functionality is
        enabled only when appropriate. Also, our system can run directly on top of
        today''s 802.11 infrastructure networks. In addition, we describe a novel,
        zero-overhead network coding scheme that further alleviates undesirable symptoms
        of the rate anomaly problem. Using simulation and testbed implementation,
        we find that SoftRepeater can improve cumulative throughput by up to 200%.",

        "title": "Stored Media Streaming in BitTorrent-like P2P Networks", "abstract":
        "Peer-to-peer (P2P) networks exist on the Internet today as a popular means
        of data distribution. However, conventional uses of P2P networking involve
        distributing stored files for use after the entire file has been downloaded.
        In this work, we investigate whether P2P networking can be used to provide
        real-time playback capabilities for stored media. For real-time playback,
        users should be able to start playback immediately, or almost immediately,
        after requesting the media and have uninterrupted playback during the download.
        To achieve this goal, it is critical to efficiently schedule the order in
        which pieces of the desired media are downloaded. Simply downloading pieces
        in sequential (earliest-first) order is prone to bottlenecks. Consequently
        we propose a hybrid of earliest-first and rarest-first scheduling ensuring
        high piece diversity while at the same time prioritizing pieces needed to
        maintain uninterrupted playback. We consider an approach to peer-assisted
        streaming that is based on BitTorrent. In particular, we show that dynamic
        adjustment of the probabilities of earliest-first and rarest-first strategies
        along with utilization of coding techniques promoting higher data diversity,
        can offer noticeable improvements for real-time playback.", "venue": "", "year":

        tunable parameter [2]. After the definition of this policy, we prove the property
        of no surprising interruption, the property of no permanent starvation, and
        two theorems about monotonicity of this policy. 1 The PBS Policy: an Introduction
        We consider a system with a single work-conserving server where tasks are
        sequentially numbered by the order of their arrival times. In other words,
        i < j always implies that task i arrives no later than task j. At every time
        t, for each task i in the system, we compute its priority value by: Pi(t)
        = ti(t) [xi(t)] , (1) where ti(t) is the sojourn time of task i (elapsed time
        since its arrival), xi(t) is the attained service time thus far, and the exponent
        \u03b1 is a tunable parameter between 0 and +\u221e. The priority-based blind
        scheduling (PBS) policy schedules a random task among the tasks with the maximal
        priority value. We present two important properties [2] without proofs. Theorem
        1.1 (basic fairness). Under PBS, if i > k, xi(t) \u2264 xk(t) for any time
        t such that both tasks are in the system. Theorem 1.2 (hospitality). Under
        PBS with \u03b1 > 0, if i > k, then Pi(t) \u2265 Pk(t) for any time t such
        that both tasks are in the system. 2 Properties of the PBS policy In this
        section, we prove two properties of the PBS policy. We say that a task is
        scheduled at time t if it receives service during interval [t, t + ] for any
        > 0. The processor share that the task receives at time t is defined to be
        the limit of the ratio between its received service and the elapsed time,
        namely , during this interval, as the elapsed time \u2192 0. Mathematically,

        balkanizing the Internet. We show that if the distribution of profits is enforced
        at a global level, then there exist profit-sharing mechanisms derived from
        the coalition games concept of Shapley value and its extensions that will
        encourage these selfish ISPs who seek to maximize their own profits to converge

        not require a static routing infrastructure, is easily implemented in a distributed

        Networks", "abstract": "To proactively defend against intruders from readily
        jeopardizing single-path data sessions, we propose a distributed secure multipath
        solution to route data across multiple paths so that intruders require much
        more resources to mount successful attacks. Our work exhibits several important
        properties that include: (1) routing decisions are made locally by network
        nodes without the centralized information of the entire network topology;
        (2) routing decisions minimize throughput loss under a single-link attack
        with respect to different session models; and (3) routing decisions address
        multiple link attacks via lexicographic optimization. We devise two algorithms
        termed the Bound-Control algorithm and the Lex-Control algorithm, both of
        which provide provably optimal solutions. Experiments show that the Bound-Control
        algorithm is more effective to prevent the worst-case single-link attack when
        compared to the single-path approach, and that the Lex-Control algorithm further
        enhances the Bound-Control algorithm by countering severe single-link attacks
        and various types of multi-link attacks. Moreover, the Lex-Control algorithm
        offers prominent protection after only a few execution rounds, implying that
        we can sacrifice minimal routing protection for significantly improved algorithm
        performance. Finally, we examine the applicability of our proposed algorithms

        set of nodes have, in the past, brought an entire network to a standstill

        This paper presents the design and implementation of a configurable blind

        the value of this parameter, the scheduler''s policy exactly emulates or closely

        also show, using synthetic workloads, that the best value for the tunable

        we develop an allocation algorithm for log-utility fairness. To maximize the

        on average. I. GENERAL PHYSICAL CHANNEL MODEL For a general analytical model
        of node throughput and interference, consider first the error probability
        of transmissions. The successful reception of a transmitted frame is determined
        through two significant stages. Initially, the frame must be detected by the
        receiver. Following this, the frame must be successfully received in the presence
        of interference both from other transmissions and external noise sources.
        In literature, many models for the two capture stages have been proposed [1],
        [2], [3]. Given a set of simultaneously transmitting neighbors, we can estimate
        the error probability of frame transmissions based on a specific channel model.
        Assume only nodes in a given node set are transmitting. In Power capture model
        [2], the detection probability of a transmission from node is determined by
        the strength of the intended signal and interference signals at node \u2019s
        receiver. After detecting the frame, the intended signal is successfully received
        when the aggregate interference is below a threshold [4]. Rather than relying
        on specific capture models, we introduce capture function . Given a transmitting
        neighbor node set , the function computes the successful reception probability
        of node \u2019s transmitted frames in consideration of interference signals
        from all nodes in . Typically, is approximated to an indicator function of

        In this paper, we explore how packet combining can address this problem. Combining
        together and broadcasting packets originally destined different receivers
        exploits multiple opportunities of packet delivery and reduces the risk of
        poor choices of rates. As a result, our algorithm more aggressively seeks
        higher transmission rates and can adapt to fast changing channel conditions.

        protocol, each node decides a price (i.e. the number of credits) charged for
        forwarding a unit amount of traffic (i.e. one data packet). One node\u2019s

        "This paper present an throughput analysis of logutility and max-min fairness.
        Assuming all nodes interfere with each other, completely or partially, log-utility
        fairness significantly enhances the total throughput compared to max-min fairness
        since the nodes should have the same throughput in max-min fairness. The improvement
        is enlarged especially when the effect of cumulated interference from multiple
        senders cannot be ignored. I. LOG-UTILITY AND MAX-MIN FAIRNESS In this paper,
        we focus on dense wireless networks using random access protocols such as
        802.11 LANs in offices and urban residential areas. We mainly consider slotted-Aloha
        systems but our analysis is simply extended for CSMA/CS networks with a single
        carrier-sensing range. In typical urban residential networks, one or few terminals
        are located closely to their access point and tend to capture a strong signal.
        The dense distribution of the access points, however, enlarges the effect
        of cumulative interference on frame reception. For fair bandwidth allocation,
        there exist two famous fairness schemes: log-utility [1] and max-min fairness.
        Log-utility or proportional fairness has been well known as a flexible and
        useful abstraction for multiplexing scarce resources among users and applications.
        Max-min fairness, however, achieve the complete fair allocation, where all
        nodes have the same throughput. Consider all nodes are within the single interference
        range. That is, any overlapped transmissions from the nodes completely collides
        and that results in transmission errors. Let be the number of nodes. In this
        case, the nodes have the attempt probability in log-utility fairness [2] and

        "P2P systems are highly vulnerable to pollution attacks in which attackers
        inject multiple versions of corrupted content into the system, which is then
        further proliferated by unsuspecting users. However, to our knowledge, there
        are no closed-form solutions that describe this phenomenon, nor are there
        models that describe how the injection of multiple versions of corrupted content
        impacts a clients'' ability to receive a valid copy. In this paper we develop
        a suite of fluid models that model pollution proliferation in P2P systems.
        These fluid models lead to systems of non-linear differential equations. We
        obtain closed-form solutions for the differential equations; for the remaining
        models, we efficiently solve the differential equations numerically. The models
        capture a variety of user behaviors, including propensity for popular versions,
        abandonment after repeated failure to obtain a good version, freeloading,
        and local version blacklisting. Our analysis reveals intelligent strategies

        "title": "Distributed, self-organizing replica placement in large scale networks",
        "abstract": "Emerging large scale distributed networking systems, such as
        P2P file sharing systems, sensor networks, and ad hoc wireless networks, require
        replication of content, functionality, or configuration to enact or optimize
        communication tasks. The placement of these replicated resources can significantly
        impact performance. In this thesis, we present self-organizing, fully distributed,
        asynchronous, scalable algorithms and protocols that can be used to place
        replicated resources in desirable locations in three different environments.
        \nWe first explore theoretical properties of replica placement problems at
        a fundamental level, and develop a fully distributed protocol in the context
        of a graph with colored nodes, where a node''s color indicates the replica/task
        that it is assigned. In this theoretical work, we introduce a novel mechanism
        with which each node in the network decides its own color, resulting in a
        graph coloring such that each node is close to any arbitrary replicated color.
        The combination of theoretical results and simulation show that the protocol
        stabilizes quickly to a coloring that is close to the optimal under a set
        of optimization criteria. \nWe then study the distributed server placement
        problem in large-scale client-server networks, such as content distribution
        networks (CDN) and online gaming networks, as a real-world application of
        our replica placement algorithm. The problem is explored in the context of
        a server coloring problem, where each server node is assigned a color that
        represents a particular server resource. Simulation results show that the
        distributed algorithm quickly generates a placement for multiple colors simultaneously,
        and reduces the expected client-server distance by almost half compared to
        the distance when the assignment of replicated servers is done at random.
        \nLast, we design, implement, and evaluate a distributed channel assignment
        algorithm in multi-hop 802.11 mesh networks, taking a further step toward
        validating the effectiveness of our replica placement mechanism. While we
        take the same strategy in addressing the distributed assignment problem in
        a self-organizing manner, we also make a significant number of new contributions
        that deal with the unique challenges present in the wireless networking environment,
        from algorithmic modifications to resolving implementation-specific issues.
        Experimental results obtained from the testbed show that our channel assignment
        algorithm improves the network''s capacity by 50% in comparison to a homogeneous
        channel assignment and by 20% in comparison to a random assignment.", "venue":

        Requirements", "abstract": "Providers of services such as online auctions
        must provision servers to respond quickly to users\u2019 requests. Assigning
        each service to its own set of servers can result in some servers being overloaded

        across the sets of servers, allowing each request to each be serviced from
        a choice of multiple servers, relieving the busiest servers. Sharing arbitrarily
        across servers, however, can be costly because of the need to maintain consistency

        "Sensor networks are especially useful in catastrophic or emergency scenarios

        may themselves fail suddenly and unpredictably, resulting in the loss of valuable

        "abstract": "While packet capture has been observed in real implementations
        of wireless devices randomly accessing shared channels, fair rate control
        algorithms based on accurate channel models that describe the phenomenon have
        not been developed. In this paper, using a general physical channel model,
        we develop the equation for the optimal attemp rate to maximize the aggregate
        log utility. We use the least squares method to approximate the equation to
        a linear function of the attempt rate. Our analysis on the approximation error
        shows that the linear function obtained is close enough to the original with
        the square of the residuals more than 0.9. I. OBTAINING CRITICAL POINT TO
        MAXIMIZE LOG UTILITIES IN RANDOM ACCESS NETWORKS We develop an algorithm to
        obtain optimal rates for log utility fairness [1] using the fixed-point iteration.
        Let be the aggregate log utility. The aggregate utility in slotted-Aloha systems
        is , where is the attempt rate of node , is the success probability of transmissions
        from node . For CSMA/CA systems with a single carrier-sensing ranges, is given
        by \"!$# &%('' ) *,+.'' , where / ''10 is the probability where any nodes

        rates of the nodes equals to 1 or ? ''-0 2 ? @,A . Especially, for node ,
        the optimal attempt rate satisfies the following: 4>5 2 C 9 ? ''10 4>5 / ''-0

        satisfying Equation 1 and function de afb 2 acb . Since function d is continuous
        and maps a rate vector to another rate vector, d has a fixed point (Brouwer\u2019s
        fixed point theorem [2]). We can further show that d converges to the fixed
        point. Thus, if we know d , acb is obtained by continuously applying d . Now,
        we formulate a function that returns satisfying Equation 1, given 9 for gFh
        2 . Since / ''-0 and 9 need to compute, Equation 1 is not easy to solve. To
        get the function to compute , we first show that Part A in Equation 1 is approximated
        to a linear function of as follows: Part A ijH IJH (k l 9nm o 4>5 9 p Drq6
        l 9nm o 4s5 9 p [ S` (3) We obtain k and q by applying the least squares method.
        Given 9 (g3h 2 ), we uniformly sample t points from the curve 4nu K 5 4v5
        [ , which is a function of , and find a linear function that closely approximates
        the sampled data to minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals between
        points generated by the function and corresponding sampled points. The computation
        time of this approximation is w^ t . Part B in Equation 1 is approximated
        by: Part B 2 C 9 9 G x 5 9 G 9 G D 4 5 9 G x i C 9 (yz 9 G W 9 G x DJ{. 9
        G W 9 G x p ` (4) After linear approximation, we have a quadratic formula
        for from Equation 1 as follows: 4 2V| Dr} W (5) where |~2 H IJH k 7 9nm o

        ) W where \u008b^\u008c \u008e \u0090 W 4 2 4 . Assuming 9 and 9 G are known,
        the total computation time of is w^ t . It is easy to see that K in Part A
        of Equation 1 is greater than 1. A linear approximation to Part A with is
        prone to larger error as K gets closer to 1. We, however, show the approximation
        error is small enough. The value of 7 9nm o $ 415 9 is maximized when all
        9 is the minimum. From Equation 2, the possible minimum of is obtained when
        b 9 G 2 U . Using 802.11 operation parameters to compute ? ''10 and ? @,A
        , K is at least 1.18 for all H IJH sending 512-byte packets at 54 Mbps. For
        all H IJH , K is more than 1.30. The larger H IJH is, the bigger K we have.
        With H IJH 2 , the square of the residuals is around 0.875008831 for in the
        range of 0 to 0.5. When H IrH 2 , the square value is beyond 0.927489457.
        For \u00893U ` and H IJH , the square value is more than 0.976722922. Note
        that the square of the residuals is an indicator of how well the linear equation
        fits. It ranges in value from 0 to 1 and the value 0.927489457 indicates that
        there is an close correlation in the estimated and actual value of Part A.
        To improve the accurate further, we repeat the approximation with different
        intervals and obtain . That is, after is obtained, we find another best-fitting
        line for a segment of the curve in an interval around the value of . Then,
        we again compute a new value of satisfying Equation 1. Repeating this process
        several times, we attain the accurate value of . In approximation for Part
        B, the square of the residuals is 0.968194017 for in the range of 0 to 0.5.
        Since 9 G x and 9 G are not a function of , Part B is continuous between 4nu
        9 G and 4 u 9 G x . It is trivial that the shorter distance between the two
        end points, the more like a line the graph looks. We can claim that the square
        of the residuals is maximized when 9 G x and 9 G are farthest away from each
        other, where 9 G x 2 4 and 9 G 2 U (because 9 G x 9 G ). Note that the optimal
        value of is typically less than 0.5 in CSMA/CA and slotted-Aloha systems.
        However, for \u0089\u0081U ` , we can compute accutate k , q , y and { by
        repeating the approximation with proper intervals.", "venue": "", "year":

        design principle. Our approach is to combine an overlay network, which allows
        us to treat authorized traffic preferentially, with a lightweight process-migration
        environment that allows us to move services easily between different parts
        of a distributed system. Functionality residing on a part of the system that
        is subjected to a DoS attack migrates to an unaffected location. The overlay
        network ensures that traffic from legitimate users, who are authenticated
        before they are allowed to access the service, is routed to the new location.
        We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach by measuring
        the performance of an experimental prototype against a series of attacks using
        PlanetLab, a distributed experimental testbed. Our preliminary results show
        that the end-toend latency remains at acceptable levels during regular operation,

        "A growing body of knowledge about misconfigurations and their effects on
        modern network routing protocols has been accumulated by network researchers
        and practitioners. The focus in identifying these anomalies and their effects
        has been on the particular and on short-term practicalities. To our knowledge,
        nobody has asked the broader and harder question: given a protocol P, what
        misconfigurations can be detected and how? Are there classes of misconfigurations
        that cannot be detected, and can these somehow be identified.We present preliminary
        results in our attempt to address this issue. We first classify detection
        methods into what we call weak detection and strong detection. A weak detection
        method is one that, given a node''s state, checks specific properties that
        should hold when the protocol is being correctly implemented. It may however
        fail to identify a detectable misconfiguration because it did not verify the
        appropriate property. Strong detection methods must, in contrast, detect any
        misconfiguration that is detectable by any property.Our work investigates
        such strong detection techniques for different routing protocols. We present
        preliminary results and demonstrate an O(|V|3) algorithm that implements strong
        detection on the Distance Vector protocol.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGOPS Symposium

        "Voice traffic on the Internet (VoIP) is poised to grow rapidly but the Internet
        is not engineered for such delay-sensitive applications. We show how the end-user
        quality of VoIP calls can be improved by rerouting them in an intermediate
        overlay network and thought the use of various path-diversity and error-coding
        techniques. We introduce our overlay network (OverPhone) that is tuned to
        optimize VoIP quality and provide experimental results of its implementation
        on the PlanetLab testbed. We show that re-routing VoIP calls through OverPhone
        improves the quality of more than a third of the paths by significant amounts
        when using the G.711 codec. We believe that this benefit extends to other
        well known and proprietary codecs as well. We also investigated the benefits
        and trade-offs of using techniques such as path-diversity and paritycoding.
        We found that path-diversity is useful in sustaining throughput at high loads,
        and that parity-codes can be used to trade-off bandwidth for path-quality.

        "title": "Can Unstructured P2P Protocols Survive", "abstract": "Today''s Internet
        periodically suffers from hot spots, a.k.a., flash crowds. A hot spot is typically
        triggered by an unan- ticipated news event that triggers an unanticipated
        surge of users that request data objects from a particular site, temporarily
        overwhelming the site''s delivery capabilities. During this time, the large
        majority of users that attempt to get these objects face the frustrating experience
        of not being able to retrieve the content they want while still being able
        to communicate effectively with all other parts of the network. In this paper,
        we examine whether simple, undirected peer-to-peer search protocols can be
        used as a backup to deliver content whose popularity suddenly spikes. We model
        a simple, representative, undirected peer-to-peer search protocol in which
        clients cache only those objects they have ex- plicitly requested. Because
        the object that becomes hot initially has limited popularity, the number of
        cache points, were they to remain fixed, would be insufficient to handle the
        level of demand during the flash crowd. However, as searches complete, more
        copies of the object become available. We analyze this natural scaling phenomenon
        and show that during the flash crowd, copies are distributed to requesting
        clients at a fast enough rate such that these simple protocols can indeed
        be used to scalably retrieve content that suddenly becomes \"hot.\" is currently
        exhibiting hot spot symptoms. The object is dis- tributed to these users that
        seek it via end-to-end communica- tion between peers (i.e., the other users
        that also seek these ob- jects). The system''s ability to deliver the content
        during the hot spot leverages off the fact that these pairwise end-to-end
        com- munications remain operational during the hot spot, and that a small
        number of users in the peer-to-peer network are still able to get through
        to the original server during the flash crowd. Prior to a hot spot event,
        users organize themselves into an overlay network: a directed graph that lies
        atop the underlying Internet infrastructure. The overlay enables its participants
        to communi- cate with one another by forwarding messages to and through other
        participants in the overlay. When a user (or its browser) finds a server unresponsive
        to its request, it can then search for the object by querying other participants
        within the overlay. Most studies of search in P2P systems assume that the
        popularity of each content item remains fixed with time. In these scenarios,
        search costs are reduced by replicating objects throughout the distributed
        (but finite) memory of the P2P system at a frequency that is correlated with
        the object''s popu- larity (1). However, during a flash crowd, an item''s
        popularity suddenly spikes such that most likely, an intelligent replication
        strategy would not have placed a sufficient number of copies of the item in
        the system. Search costs for the suddenly-pop- ular item would therefore be
        higher. Does this doom simple, undirected P2P solutions to failure? In this
        paper, we show that even simple P2P solutions natu- rally handle sudden spikes
        in demand. We develop a model of a simple yet representative, undirected search
        protocol similar", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount":

        "In a P2P system, a client peer may select one or more server peers to download
        a specific file. In a P2P resource economy, the server peers charge the client
        for the downloading. A server peer''s price would naturally depend on the
        specific object being downloaded, the duration of the download, and the rate
        at which the download is to occur. The optimal peer selection problem is to
        select, from the set of peers that have the desired object, the subset of
        peers and download rates that minimizes cost. In this paper we examine a number
        of natural peer selection problems for both P2P downloading and P2P streaming.
        For downloading, we obtain the optimal solution for minimizing the download
        delay subject to a budget constraint, as well as the corresponding Nash equilibrium.
        For the streaming problem, we obtain a solution that minimizes cost subject
        to continuous playback while allowing for one or more server peers to fail
        during the streaming process. The methodologies developed in this paper are

        "title": "Distributed algorithms for secure multipath routing", "abstract":
        "To proactively defend against intruders from readily jeopardizing single-path
        data sessions, we propose a distributed secure multipath solution to route
        data across multiple paths so that intruders require much more resources to
        mount successful attacks. Our work exhibits several crucial properties that
        differentiate itself from previous approaches. They include (1) distributed
        routing decisions: routing decisions are made without the centralized information
        of the entire network topology, (2) bandwidth-constraint adaptation: the worst-case
        link attack is mitigated for any feasible session throughput subject to the
        link-bandwidth constraints, and (3) lexicographic protection: severe link
        attacks are suppressed based on lexicographic optimization. We devise two
        algorithms for the solution, termed the bound-control algorithm and the lex-control
        algorithm, and prove their convergence to the respective optimal solutions.
        Experiments show that the bound-control algorithm is more effective to prevent
        the worst-case single-link attack when compared to the single-path approach,
        and that the lex-control algorithm further enhances the bound-control algorithm
        by countering severe single-link attacks and various models of multi-link
        attacks. Moreover, the lex-control algorithm offers prominent protection after
        only a few execution rounds. Thus, system designers can sacrifice minimal
        routing security for significantly improved algorithm performance when deploying
        the distributed secure multipath solution.", "venue": "Proceedings IEEE 24th

        "title": "Resource management in large-scale services: models and algorithms",
        "abstract": "Many of the services in today''s Internet (e.g. file transfer,
        streaming media, auctions) are offered by companies that either own or lease
        a fixed, static set of server resources to host these services. Under such
        a structure, a company can provision their serving resources for its typical
        loads or to conservatively handle peak demands. Either way has drawbacks.
        In the former, poor performance is expected when peaks of demand occur. In
        the latter, costly resources remain idle most of the time. \nThis thesis explores
        provisioning alternatives that use pools of servers in novel ways that permit
        provisioning for typical loads but can still accommodate peak demands. Three
        specific problems are explored by constructing mathematical models and analyzing
        these models. \nFirst, we explore benefits for independent companies from
        pooling together of their own servers to jointly serve data delivery. This
        data may have real-time requirements (e.g., multimedia), or it may be elastic
        (e.g., file transfer). We show that such pooling can simultaneously benefit
        all companies participating in this arrangement, but that it is necessary
        for these companies to have similar demands and to offer similar quantities
        of serving resources. \nSecond, we explore how to reduce transaction times
        for transaction-oriented services, such as an auction website. If such a service
        is replicated across multiple servers, these servers must be kept consistent,
        and replicating the service across many servers will do more harm than good,
        as the cost to maintain consistency will offset the gains made from distributing
        the load. We explore the performance of heuristic-based algorithms that identify
        provisionings that are close to optimal. \nLast, we consider a general provisioning
        problem for a business that owns a server farm, and must decide how to allocate
        its fixed pool of servers among a set of independent companies that offer
        transaction-oriented services. The optimal allocation is a function of the
        loads imposed by each company, the profit each company offers for a successful
        transaction, and the cost that the server farm must pay for each failed transaction.
        We derive three approximation methods for partitioning the fixed set of servers
        among the various companies.", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "referenceCount":

        "abstract": "Routing protocols in most ad hoc networks use the length of paths
        as the routing metric. Recent findings have revealed that the minimum-hop
        metric can not achieve the maximum throughput because it tries to reduce the
        number of hops by containing long range links, where packets need to be transmitted
        at the lowest transmission rate. In this paper, we investigate the tradeoff
        between transmission rates and throughputs and show that in dense networks
        with uniform-distributed traffic, there exists the optimal rate that may not
        be the lowest rate. Based on our observation, we propose a new routing metric,
        which measures the expected capability of a path assuming the per-node fairness.
        We develop a routing protocol based on DSDV and demonstrate that the routing

        "title": "Pricing multicasting in more flexible network models", "abstract":
        "The problem of designing efficient algorithms for sharing the cost of multicasting
        has recently received considerable attention. In this article, we examine
        the effect on the complexity of pricing when two flexibility-enhancing mechanisms
        are incorporated into the network model. In particular, we study a model where
        the session is offered at a number of different rates of transmission, and
        where there is a cost for enabling multicasting at each node of the network.
        We consider two techniques that have been used in practice to provide multiple
        rates: using a layered transmission scheme (called the layered paradigm) and
        using different multicast groups for each possible rate (called the split
        session paradigm). We demonstrate that the difference between these two paradigms
        has a significant impact on the complexity of pricing multicasting.For the
        layered paradigm, we provide a distributed algorithm for computing pricing
        efficiently in terms of local computation and message complexity. For the
        split session paradigm, on the other hand, we demonstrate that this problem
        can be solved in polynomial time if the number of possible rates is fixed,
        but if the number of rates is part of the input, then the problem becomes
        NP-Hard even to approximate. We also examine the effect of delivering the
        transmissions for the various rates from different locations within the network.
        We show that, in this case, the pricing problem becomes NP-Hard for the split
        session paradigm even for a fixed constant number of possible rates but if
        layering is used, then it can be solved in polynomial time by formulating
        the problem as a totally unimodular integer program.", "venue": "TALG", "year":

        "title": "Content distribution for seamless transmission", "abstract": "We
        introduce a new paradigm in information transmission, the concept of SEAMLESS
        TRANSMISSION, whereby any client in a network requesting a file starts receiving
        it immediately, and experiences no delays throughout the remainder of the
        downloading time. This notion is based on the partial caching concept [2]
        which was introduced to overcome some of the disadvantages of traditional
        cache replacement algorithms such as LRU and LRU-threshold [1]. The main idea
        of partial caching is to store an initial part of the file in the cache and
        to obtain the rest of the file from the origin server. To achieve the maximal
        retrieval performance of seamless transmission, clients must be prepared to
        re-sequence segments of the files received out of order. With this caveat,
        seamless transmission can be viewed as a way to implement strict quality of
        service (QoS) guarantees to all clients of a network. This paper gives a provably

        propose an architecture called secure overlay services (SOS) that proactively
        prevents denial of service (DoS) attacks, including distributed (DDoS) attacks;
        it is geared toward supporting emergency services, or similar types of communication.
        The architecture uses a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via
        consistent hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful
        attacks by: 1) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges,
        pushing the attack point perimeter into the core of the network, where high-speed
        routers can handle the volume of attack traffic and 2) introducing randomness
        and anonymity into the forwarding architecture, making it difficult for an
        attacker to target nodes along the path to a specific SOS-protected destination.
        Using simple analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker
        can successfully launch a DoS attack against an SOS-protected network. Our
        analysis demonstrates that such an architecture reduces the likelihood of
        a successful attack to minuscule levels. Our performance measurements using
        a prototype implementation indicate an increase in end-to-end latency by a
        factor of two for the general case, and an average heal time of less than

        "abstract": "The volume of multimedia data, including video, served through
        peer-to-peer (P2P) networks is growing rapidly. Unfortunately, high bandwidth
        transfer rates are rarely available to P2P clients on a consistent basis,
        making it difficult to use P2P networks to stream video for on-line viewing.
        In this paper, we develop and evaluate on-line algorithms that coordinate
        the pre-fetching of scalably-coded variable bitrate video. These algorithms
        are ideal for P2P environments in that they require no knowledge of the future
        variability or availability of bandwidth, yet produce a playback whose average
        rate and variability are comparable to the best off-line prefetching algorithms
        that have total future knowledge. To show this, we develop an off-line algorithm
        that provably optimizes quality and variability metrics. Using simulations
        based on actual P2P traces, we compare our on-line algorithms to the optimal
        off-line algorithm and find that our novel on-line algorithms exhibit near-optimal
        performance and significantly outperform more traditional pre-fetching methods.",

        "Peer to Peer (P2P) systems that utilize Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs) provide
        a scalable means to distribute the handling of lookups. However, this scalability
        comes at the expense of increased vulnerability to specific types of attacks.
        In this paper, we focus on insider denial of service (DoS) attacks on such
        systems. In these attacks, nodes that are part of the DHT system are compromised
        and used to flood other nodes in the DHT with excessive request traffic. We
        devise a distributed lightweight protocol that detects such attacks, implemented
        solely within nodes that participate in the DHT. Our approach exploits inherent
        structural invariants of DHTs to ferret out attacking nodes whose request
        patterns deviate from \u201cnormal\u201d behavior. We evaluate our protocol\u2019s
        ability to detect attackers via simulation within a Chord network. The results
        show that our system can detect a simple attacker whose attack traffic deviates
        by as little as 5% from a normal request traffic. We also demonstrate the
        resiliency of our protocol to coordinated attacks by up to as many as 25%
        of nodes. Our work shows that DHTs can protect themselves from insider flooding
        attacks, eliminating an important roadblock to their deployment and use in
        untrusted environments.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 23,

        "title": "On the robustness of soft state protocols", "abstract": "Soft state
        has been a mantra of Internet protocol design for the past decade. System
        designers build protocols that implement soft state mechanisms based on intuition
        or on qualitative arguments that the design is \"better\", yet there has never
        been a formal performance evaluation study that draws the same conclusion.
        In fact, previous attempts [P. Ji et al., 2003 and S. Raman et al., 1999]
        to build such a quantitative argument have found that pure soft state protocols
        significantly under-perform their hard state counterparts, and that only soft-hard
        hybrids can match hard state protocol performance. In this paper, we argue
        otherwise. We develop models that provide a performance-oriented explanation
        and justification of the Internet designer''s intuition. The novel observation
        is that, if network conditions are known, a hard state protocol can always
        be configured to outperform its soft state counterpart. However, in reality,
        network conditions are unpredictable, and that soft state protocols are much
        more resilient to unanticipated fluctuations in these conditions.", "venue":

        complicating the task of provisioning serving resources so that requests for
        its content are not rejected. One way to address this problem is to have providers
        form a collective in which they pool together their serving resources to assist
        in servicing requests for one another''s content. In this paper, we determine
        the conditions under which a provider''s participation in a collective reduces
        the rejection rate of requests for its content - a property that is necessary
        for such a provider to justify its participation within the collective. We
        show that all request rejection rates are reduced when the collective is formed
        from a homogeneous set of providers, but that some rates can increase within
        heterogeneous sets. We also show that, asymptotically, growing the size of
        the collective will sometimes, but not always, resolve this problem. We explore
        the use of thresholding techniques, where each collective participant sets
        aside a portion of its serving resources to serve only requests for its own
        content. We show that thresholding allows a more diverse set of providers
        to benefit from the collective model, making collectives a more viable option
        for content delivery services.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and

        SABER (Survivability Architecture: Block, Evade, React), a proposed survivability
        architecture that blocks, evades and reacts to a variety of attacks by using
        several security and survivability mechanisms in an automated and coordinated
        fashion. Contrary to the ad hoc manner in which contemporary survivable systems
        are built-using isolated, independent security mechanisms such as firewalls,
        intrusion detection systems and software sandboxes-SABER integrates several
        different technologies in an attempt to provide a unified framework for responding
        to the wide range of attacks malicious insiders and outsiders can launch.\n
        This coordinated multi-layer approach will be capable of defending against
        attacks targeted at various levels of the network stack, such as congestion-based
        DoS attacks, software-based DoS or code-injection attacks, and others. Our
        fundamental insight is that while multiple lines of defense are useful, most
        conventional, uncoordinated approaches fail to exploit the full range of available
        responses to incidents. By coordinating the response, the ability to survive
        successful security breaches increases substantially.\n We discuss the key
        components of SABER, how they will be integrated together, and how we can
        leverage on the promising results of the individual components to improve
        survivability in a variety of coordinated attack scenarios. SABER is currently
        in the prototyping stages, with several interesting open research topics.",

        constant change. One approach to reducing the cost of finding information
        within these networks is to replicate the information among multiple points
        within the network. A desirable replication approach should cache copies of
        all pieces of information as close to each node as possible without exceeding
        the storage resources of the nodes within the network. In addition, the approach
        should require minimum communication overhead among participating nodes and
        should adjust the locations of stored content as connectivity within the network
        changes. Here, we formulate this caching problem as a graph coloring problem,
        where the color of the node determines the content that the node should store.
        We present a distributed algorithm where each node chooses its color in a
        greedy manner, minimizing its own distance to the color furthest from it.
        We demonstrate convergence of this algorithm and evaluate its performance

        "title": "Pricing multicasting in more practical network models", "abstract":
        "The problem of designing efficient algorithms for sharing the cost of multicasting
        has recently seen considerable attention. In this paper, we examine the effect
        on the complexity of pricing when two practical considerations are incorporated
        into the network model. In particular, we study a model where the session
        is offered at a number of different rates of transmission, and where there
        is a cost for enabling multicasting at each node of the network. We consider
        two techniques that have been used in practice to provide multiple rates:
        using a layered transmission scheme (called the layered paradigm) and using
        different multicast groups for each possible rate (called the split session
        paradigm). We demonstrate that the difference between these two paradigms
        has a significant impact on the complexity of pricing multicasting.For the
        layered paradigm, we provide a distributed algorithm for computing pricing
        efficiently in terms of local computation and message complexity. For the
        split session paradigm, on the other hand, we demonstrate that this problem
        can be solved in polynomial time if the number of possible rates is fixed,
        but if the number of rates is part of the input, then the problem becomes
        NP-Hard even to approximate. We also examine the effect of delivering the
        transmissions for the various rates from different locations within the network.
        We show that in this case, the pricing problem becomes NP-Hard for the split
        session paradigm even for a fixed constant number of possible rates, but if
        layering is used, then it can be solved in polynomial time by formulating
        the problem as a totally unimodular integer program.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM

        expressed are solely those of the authors, and questions about the content
        should be directed to them. Abstract Today''s Internet periodically suffers
        from hot spots, a.k.a., flash crowds. A hot spot is typically triggered by
        some unanticipated news event that causes an unanticipated surge of users
        to request data objects from a particular site, temporarily overwhelming the
        site''s delivery capabilities. During this time, the large majority of users
        that attempt to get these objects face the frustrating experience of not being
        able to retrieve the content they want while still being able to communicate
        effectively with all other parts of the network. In this paper, we mathematically
        model and simulate a simple, distributed, randomized peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol.
        This protocol runs atop a network overlay during a hot spot to quickly deliver
        the \" hot \" object from a small set of users who were able to obtain the
        object to a much larger set of users that desire it. Our results based on
        this evaluation show that this type of protocol can scale effectively to millions
        of users, demonstrating that peer-to-peer approaches can be an effective means
        to alleviate problems commonly associated with network hot spots.", "venue":

        attacks continue to threaten the reliability of networking systems. Previous
        approaches for protecting networks from DoS attacks are reactive in that they
        wait for an attack to be launched before taking appropriate measures to protect
        the network. This leaves the door open for other attacks that use more sophisticated
        methods to mask their traffic.We propose an architecture called Secure Overlay
        Services (SOS) that proactively prevents DoS attacks, geared toward supporting
        Emergency Services or similar types of communication. The architecture is
        constructed using a combination of secure overlay tunneling, routing via consistent
        hashing, and filtering. We reduce the probability of successful attacks by
        (i) performing intensive filtering near protected network edges, pushing the
        attack point perimeter into the core of the network, where high-speed routers
        can handle the volume of attack traffic, and (ii) introducing randomness and
        anonymity into the architecture, making it difficult for an attacker to target
        nodes along the path to a specific SOS-protected destination.Using simple
        analytical models, we evaluate the likelihood that an attacker can successfully

        "abstract": "Current Internet congestion control protocols operate independently
        on a per-flow basis. Recent work has demonstrated that cooperative congestion
        control strategies between flows can improve performance for a variety of
        applications, ranging from aggregated TCP transmissions to multiple-sender
        multicast applications. However, in order for this cooperation to be effective,
        one must first identify the flows that are congested at the same set of resources.
        In this paper, we present techniques based on loss or delay observations at
        end hosts to infer whether or not two flows experiencing congestion are congested
        at the same network resources. Our novel result is that such detection can
        be achieved for unicast flows, but the techniques can also be applied to multicast
        flows. We validate these techniques via queueing analysis, simulation, and
        experimentation within the Internet. In addition, we demonstrate preliminary
        simulation results that show that the delay-based technique can determine
        whether two TCP flows are congested at the same set of resources. We also

        "title": "THE COLUMBIA HOTSPOT RESCUE SERVICE: A RESEARCH PLAN", "abstract":
        "The technical reports in this series are considered to be semi-formal. The
        ideas expressed are solely those of the authors, and questions about the content
        should be directed to them. 1 Introduction Internet performance is unpredictable,
        and users often find the level of service inadequate. We expect this problem
        to worsen as the Internet continues to grow, both in the number of users and
        in the stringency of the requirements of new applications. Intolerable levels
        of service stem from a lack of sufficient resources being targeted to locations
        where service quality is lacking. In a system as complex as the Internet,
        the insufficient resource can be of many types. It may be a server with insufficient
        processing power to handle a large load of requests. It may be a router at
        the edge of the network that is forced to carry a heavy load to or from its
        local area network. It may be a router in the middle of the network that must
        carry a large load, perhaps connecting a set of ISPs, such that upgrading
        its performance does not directly increase any company''s profits. Lastly,
        it may be an attacker intentionally trying to bring down a portion of the
        network. Commonly, the periods of insufficiency are short-lived. In other
        words, the resources allocated within a network to support a service are sufficient
        most of the time, but every so often and quite suddenly, there may be a sharp
        increase in demand, and the resource quickly becomes overwhelmed. Such an
        event is called a network hotspot [1, 2]. There are several remedies currently
        available to deal with network hotspots. The easiest, most common solution
        is to make do with the network as is and deal ad hoc with the unpredictable
        level of service. A second remedy that works in theory is to \" build a better
        network \" in which hot spots do not occur. Here, each network and server

        "title": "Pricing Multicasting in More Practical Network Models TITLE2", "abstract":
        "In [9], Feigenbaum, Papadimitriou and Shenker initiate the study of pricing
        algorithms for multicast transmission. In this paper, we build on this work
        by studying the effect on the complexity of pricing when two practical considerations
        are incorporated into the network model. In particular, we study a model where
        the session is offered at a number of different rates of transmission, and
        where there is a cost for enabling multicasting at each node of the network.
        As a test case for the different types of pricing that can occur, we consider
        a pricing mechanism, called Marginal Cost, that has seen considerable attention
        in simpler network models. We demonstrate that the details of how multiple
        rates are provided has a significant impact on the complexity of pricing.
        For multiple rates provided via the layered paradigm, we provide a distributed
        algorithm for computing Marginal Cost efficiently in terms of local computation
        and message complexity. The bit complexity (per edge) of this algorithm depends
        linearly on the product of the tree height and the number of possible rates.
        However, we provide two lower bounds on bit complexity, demonstrating that
        computing Marginal Cost (a) with multiple rates requires a bit complexity
        that is linear in the number of rates, and (b) with a cost for enabling multicasting
        requires a bit complexity that is linear in the height of the tree. A modification
        of our algorithm for the layered paradigm also applies to the split session
        paradigm of providing multiple rates, but in this case, both the local computation
        and the bit complexity become exponential in the number of possible rates.
        However, we also demonstrate that for the split session paradigm, the problem
        becomes NP-Hard even to approximate if the number of possible rates is part
        of the input. This indicates that we cannot expect to do much better than
        the algorithm we provide. Finally, we examine the effect of delivering the
        information for the different rates from different locations within the network.
        We show that in this case, the Marginal Cost problem becomes NP-Hard in the
        split session paradigm even for a constant number of possible rates, but that
        in the layered paradigm it can be solved in polynomial time by formulating
        the problem as a linear program that is guaranteed to have an integral optimal
        solution.", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        Multicast Streaming Media", "abstract": "IP multicast provides best-effort
        delivery. Packets encounter variable delays and may be lost because of transmission
        errors and buffer overflows. Real-time multimedia streaming services require
        that most packets arrive at the receivers prior to an application deadline.
        Multicast quality on the current Internet is often inadequate for these applications.
        We have solved this problem by placing repair servers inside the network.
        The repair servers recover missing packets by communicating with each other,
        then re-multicast the repaired stream to nearby receivers on a new address.
        Multicast reception in the constrained area is typically much better than
        in the wide area Internet. In this paper we address the problem of constructing
        a repair graph. The repair graph shows which repair servers each repair server
        communicates with to recover missing messages. Our objectives when constructing
        this graph conflict with each other. We want high reliability: every repair
        server to recover as many missing messages as possible, as quickly as possible.
        But we also want low cost: this recovery should use as little of the network
        bandwidth as possible. We present a centralized algorithm to generate repair
        graphs. We demonstrate through simulation that these graphs achieve a level
        of reliability that is almost as high as that achieved by repair graphs specifically

        "Many definitions of fairness for multicast networks assume that sessions
        are single rate, requiring that each multicast session transmits data to all
        of its receivers at the same rate. These definitions do not account for multirate
        approaches, such as layering, that permit receiving rates within a session
        to be chosen independently. We identify four desirable fairness properties
        for multicast networks, derived from properties that hold within the max-min
        fair allocations of unicast networks. We extend the definition of multicast
        max-min fairness to networks that contain multirate sessions, and show that
        all four fairness properties hold in a multirate max-min fair allocation,
        but need not hold in a single-rate max-min fair allocation. We then show that
        multirate max-min fair rate allocations can be achieved via intra-session
        coordinated joins and leaves of multicast groups. However, in the absence
        of coordination, the resulting max-min fair rate allocation uses link bandwidth
        inefficiently, and does not exhibit some of the desirable fairness properties.
        We evaluate this inefficiency for several layered multirate congestion control
        schemes, and find that, in a protocol where the sender coordinates joins,
        this inefficiency has minimal impact on desirable fairness properties. Our
        results indicate that sender-coordinated layered protocols show promise for
        achieving desirable fairness properties for allocations in large-scale multicast

        "title": "The impact of multicast layering on network fairness", "abstract":
        "Many definitions of fairness for multicast networks assume that sessions
        are single-rate, requiring that each multicast session transmits data to all
        of its receivers at the same rate. These definitions do not account for multi-rate
        approaches, such as layering, that permit receiving rates within a session
        to be chosen independently. We identify four desirable fairness properties
        for multicast networks, derived from properties that hold within the max-min
        fair allocations of unicast networks. We extend the definition of multicast
        max-min fairness to networks that contain multi-rate sessions, and show that
        all four fairness properties hold in a multi-rate max-min fair allocation,
        but need not hold in a single-rate max-min fair allocation. We then show that
        multi-rate max-min fair rate allocations can be achieved via intra-session
        coordinated joins and leaves of multicast groups. However, in the absence
        of coordination, the resulting max-min fair rate allocation uses link bandwidth
        inefficiently, and does not exhibit some of the desirable fairness properties.
        We evaluate this inefficiency for several layered multi-rate congestion control
        schemes, and find that, in a protocol where the sender coordinates joins,
        this inefficiency has minimal impact on desirable fairness properties. Our
        results indicate that sender-coordinated layered protocols show promise for
        achieving desirable fairness properties for allocations in large-scale multicast
        networks.", "venue": "Conference on Applications, Technologies, Architectures,

        examine repair service/FEC combination protocols in an environment where loss
        rates differ across domains within the network. We find that repair services
        are more effective than FEC at reducing bandwidth utilization in such environments.

        TITLE2:", "abstract": "Real-Time reliable multicast over a best-effort service
        network remains a challenging research problem. Most protocols for reliable
        multicast use repair techniques that result in significant and variable delay,
        which can lead to missed deadlines in real-time scenarios. This paper presents
        a repair technique that combines forward error correction (FEC) with automatic
        repeat request (ARQ). The novel aspect of the technique is its ability to
        reduce delay in reliable multicast delivery by sending repairs proactively
        (i.e., before they are required). The technique requires minimal state at
        senders and receivers, and no additional active router functionality beyond
        what is required by the current multicast service model. Furthermore, the
        technique uses only end-to-end mechanisms, where all data and repairs are
        transmitted by the data-originating source, leaving receivers free from any
        burden of sending repairs. We simulate a simple round-based version of a protocol
        embodying this technique to show its effectiveness in preventing repair request
        implosion, reducing the expected time of reliable delivery of data, and keeping
        bandwidth usage for repairs low. We show how a protocol using the technique
        can be adapted to provide delivery that is reliable before a real-time deadline
        with probabilities extremely close to one. Finally, we develop several variations
        of the protocol that use the technique in various fashions for high rate data
        streaming applications, and present results from additional simulations that
        examine performance in a variety of Internet-like heterogeneous networks.",

        "title": "A Theory for Networks with Misconfigured Routers", "abstract": "For
        the past several decades, work that develops and analyzes network routing
        protocols has assumed that each network node properly implements the algorithm
        that establishes routes through the network. However, there have been several
        instances in which a trivial misconfiguration in a single router\u2019s implementation
        of the routing algorithm induced undesirable routes within the majority of
        the network. Given the high likelihood of program error or sabotage in today\u2019s
        networks, there is an urgent need to develop techniques that allow properlyconfigured
        routers to identify anomalous behaviors of their misconfigured counterparts.
        In this paper, we describe our development of a general theory that examines
        routing protocols in environments where some misconfigured routers \u201cmisbehave\u201d
        and (intentionally or unintentionally) issue inaccurate reports that shift
        routing paths in the network. Application of this theory allows a node to
        \u201csense\u201d the presence of a misconfiguration in the network through
        an analysis of its routing state. We show, using the Distance Vector routing
        protocol as an example, how this theory can be applied to practical routing
        protocols. We also describe our plans for a practical tool based on this theory
        that can be used by network administrators to detect anomalies.", "venue":

        of horses has made them a classic example of evolutionary processes. However,
        while the overall picture of equid evolution is well known, the details are
        surprisingly poorly understood, especially for the later Pliocene and Pleistocene,
        c. 3 million to 0.01 million years (Ma) ago, and nowhere more so than in the
        Americas. There is no consensus on the number of equid species or even the

        of the endemic South American genus Hippidion is unresolved, as is the phylogenetic
        position of the \u201cstilt-legged\u201d horses of North America. Using ancient

        (true) horses, with origins considerably more recent than the currently accepted
        date of c. 10 Ma. Furthermore, we show that stilt-legged horses, commonly
        regarded as Old World migrants related to the hemionid asses of Asia, were
        in fact an endemic North American lineage. Finally, our data suggest that

        "title": "A NEW DOUBLY SUBSTITUTED SICKLING HAEMOGLOBIN: HbS\u2010OMAN", "abstract":
        "It is now evident that HbS (p6 Glu-tVal) has arisen independently iin several
        different geographical locations to give a balanced polymorphism that provides
        a survival advantage against malaria (Bunn & Forget, 1986). A secondary consequence
        has been the development of a series of other mutations that modify the sickling
        properties of HbS (reviewed by B u n & Forget, 1986). Examples of mutations
        that modify sickling in heterozygotes with HbS are Hb KorleBu, 873 Asp-Asn
        (Bookchin et al, 1970) and HbO-Arab, p l 2 l Glu+Lys (Milner et al, 1970).
        A more subtle modification of sickling occurs if mutations such as these are
        on the allele itself giving rise to a double mutant as in HbC-Harlem (Bookchin
        et al, 1967), HbC-Ziguinchor (Goosens et al, 1975), HbS-Travis (Moo-Penn et
        al, 1977), HbS-Antilles (Monplaisir et al, 1986) and HbS-Providence (Gale
        et al, 1988). Here, we describe the finding of a new sickling variant with
        a double mutation, HbS-Oman p6 Glu-tVal, PI21 Glu +Lys. The patient, (a 24-year-old
        male, born in Oman of OmaniArab lineage, presented with a n isolated bout
        of haematuria attributed to schistosomiasis. There was no history of past
        haematological problems and in particular of any symptoms related to sickling
        crises. The patient\u2019s red cell indices resembled those of thalassaemia
        minor with a mild microcytosis and hypochromia. His iron status was normal
        and DNA restriction mapping subsequently demonstrated homozygosity for the
        deletion form of a+ thalassaemia. A moderate number of target cells were present
        in the patient\u2019s blood film as well as some bizarre poikilocytes tending
        towards the sickle cell shape. A positive sickling test was obtained on whole
        blood. On cellulose acetate electrophoresis a t pH 8.6, the variant migrated
        cathodally to HbC. Globin chain electrophoresis further indicated the presence
        of a mutant p globin chain bearing a triple increase in positive charge. The
        variant haemoglobin constituted 14.5% of the total haemoglobin as determined
        by both elution from cellulose acetate and DEAE Sephadex chromatography. The
        HbAr fraction amounted to 4.2% but was probably within the normal range (1.8-3.3%)
        when allowance is made for contamination with the fast component of 1 he variant.
        The HbF level was consistently below 1% of the total haemoglobin. Globin tryptic
        digests were prepared of the variant (isolated by chromatography on DEAE Sephadex)
        and two-dimensional peptide mapping was carried out by electrophoresis at
        pH 6-4 followed by chromatography in pyridine/isoamyl alcohol/water (6: 6:
        7). Two abnormalities were evident in the peptide maps of HbS-Oman. The first
        was the HbS mutation (/36 Glu+Val) characterized by the replacement of the
        normal pA1 peptide by the more acidic p\u201d peptide. The second abnormality
        was the HbO-Arab mutation ( p l 2 1 Glu-tLys) in which the normal tyrosine-containing
        p 1 3 peptide was replaced by three new tyrosine-containing peptides characteristic
        of HbO-Arab. The amino acid substitutions were confirmed by amino acid analysis
        of the isolated abnormal peptides. HbS-Oman therefore has a doubly substituted
        p chain carrying the two previously well-characterized mutations of HbS and
        HbO-Arab, i.e. p\u201d-Oman (p6 Val, D121 LYS). The stability of HbS-Oman
        is the same as that of HbS. In preliminary oxygen affinity studies, whole
        blood containing 14.5% HbS-Oman had a normal oxygen dissociation curve with
        a P5\u201d value of 3 0 mmHg (normal range 24-30 mmHg). Purified HbS-Oman
        is, however, considerably less soluble than purified HbS as determined by
        their relative Cs,, values (method of Benesch et al, 1979). We obtained a
        C,,, value of 17.8 g/dl for HbS and a value of 11.8 g/dl for HbS-Oman, which
        is similar to that reported for HbS-Antilles (p6 Glu-+Val, 23 Val-+Ile) by
        Monplaisir et al (1986). HbSAntilles in heterozygotes constituted 40-50% of
        the total haemoglobin and presented as a sickling disorder in association
        with mild haemolytic anaemia and the presence of irreversibly sickled cells
        in peripheral blood films. In comparison to this, whereas the solubility of
        HbS-Oman is similar to HbS-Antilles and cells approaching the appearance of
        sickle cells were present in our patient\u2019s blood film, he has no clinical
        symptoms associated with sickling haemoglobin. This is no doubt the result
        of the comparatively low level of HbS-Oman, due largely to the accompanying
        c1 thalassaemia, although it is possible that the particularly low level of
        the variant may also be influenced by the extreme positive charge on the p-Oman
        globin chain and its effect on the electrostatic interactions involved in
        haemoglobin subunit assembly (Bunn & McDonald, 198 3). Unfortunately family
        studies, which may have helped determine the relative contributions of these
        factors to the circulating level of this variant, have not been possible.
        The modification of sickling by the presence of a second amino acid substitution
        in double heterozygotes and in double substituted sickling variants has provided
        insight into the interactions involved in the stabilization of the sickle
        polymer. Double heterozygotes with HbS and HbO-Arab exhibit a sickling disorder
        comparable to SS disease itself in severity as indeed do double heterozygotes
        with HbS and HbD (8121 Glu-Gln) indicating that the p l 2 l glutamic acid
        residue has a destabilizing effect on the deoxyhaemoglobin S polymer (Bunn
        & Forget, 1986). The decreased solubility of HbS-Oman indicates that the p12
        1 Glu+Lys mutation has a similar effect on polymerization when present on

        body of research on mammalian mating strategies and sexual selection. Despite
        some contrary evidence, the narrative that larger males are the norm in mammals
        \u2013 upheld since Darwin\u2019s Descent of Man \u2013 still dominates today,
        supported by meta-analyses that use crude measures of dimorphism and taxonomically-biased
        data. With newly-available datasets and primary sources reporting sex-segregated
        means and variances in adult body mass, we estimated statistically-determined
        rates of SSD in mammals, sampling taxa by their species richness at the family
        level. Our analyses of >400 species indicate that although males tend to be
        larger than females when dimorphism occurs, males are not larger in most mammals,
        and suggest a need to revisit other assumptions in sexual selection research.
        One-Sentence Summary Taxonomically-balanced estimates of rates of sexual size
        dimorphism in mammals refute the \u2018larger males\u2019 narrative.", "venue":

        Behavior from Monocular Videos", "abstract": "An automatic, quick, accurate,
        and scalable method for animal behavior inference using only videos of animals
        offers unprecedented opportunities to understand complex biological phenomena
        and answer challenging ecological questions. The advent of sophisticated machine
        learning techniques now allows the development and implementation of such
        a method. However, apart from developing a network model that infers animal
        behavior from video inputs, the key challenge is to obtain sufficient labeled
        (annotated) data to successfully train that network - a laborious task that
        needs to be repeated for every species and/or animal system. Here, we propose
        solutions for both problems, i) a novel methodology for rapidly generating
        large amounts of annotated data of animals from videos and ii) using it to
        reliably train deep neural network models to infer the different behavioral
        states of every animal in each frame of the video. Our method\u2019s workflow
        is bootstrapped with a relatively small amount of manually-labeled video frames.
        We develop and implement this novel method by building upon the open-source
        tool Smarter-LabelMe, leveraging deep convolutional visual detection and tracking
        in combination with our behavior inference model to quickly produce large
        amounts of reliable training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
        method on aerial videos of plains and Gr\u00e9vy\u2019s Zebras (Equus quagga
        and Equus grevyi). We fully open-source the code1 of our method as well as
        provide large amounts of accurately-annotated video datasets2 of zebra behavior
        using our method. A video abstract of this paper is available here3.", "venue":

        Neural Networks", "abstract": "Discovering evolutionary traits that are heritable
        across species on the tree of life (also referred to as a phylogenetic tree)
        is of great interest to biologists to understand how organisms diversify and

        process, making trait discovery a highly label-scarce problem. We present
        a novel approach for discovering evolutionary traits directly from images
        without relying on trait labels. Our proposed approach, Phylo-NN, encodes
        the image of an organism into a sequence of quantized feature vectors -or
        codes- where different segments of the sequence capture evolutionary signals
        at varying ancestry levels in the phylogeny. We demonstrate the effectiveness
        of our approach in producing biologically meaningful results in a number of
        downstream tasks including species image generation and species-to-species

        research is growing, comparatively little attention is paid to fisheries in
        urban environments. We aim to address this imbalance, because as cities expand
        worldwide, we expect urban fisheries to become more widespread and important
        in providing food/nutrition security, recreation, community well-being, and
        other benefits to fisheries stakeholders and urban dwellers across spatiotemporal
        scales. This paper contains a first analysis of the economic and sociocultural
        provisions, trade-offs, and dilemmas associated with urban fisheries to yield
        insights for sustainable management and planning of urban blue space. To address
        these objectives, we use the metacoupling framework, a method for assessing
        human\u2013nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant fisheries
        systems. We use examples from multiple countries and data from the United
        States to illustrate how urban fisheries encompass flows of people, money,
        and information across multiple spatiotemporal scales and provide nutritional,
        recreational, social, and cultural benefits to fisheries stakeholders. Throughout
        the world, urban fisheries are influenced by wide-ranging human needs (e.g.
        food provisioning, recreation, aquatic resource education) that generate social-ecological
        effects within and beyond cities. Our analysis yields insights for developing
        holistic, metacoupling-informed management approaches that address the diverse
        social-ecological objectives and trade-offs involved in sustainable development

        in wild equids", "abstract": "Abstract For grazing herbivores, dung density
        in feeding areas is an important determinant of exposure risk to fecal\u2010orally
        transmitted parasites. When host species share the same parasite species,
        a nonrandom distribution of their cumulative dung density and/or nonrandom
        ranging and feeding behavior may skew exposure risk and the relative selection
        pressure parasites impose on each host. The arid\u2010adapted Grevy''s zebra
        (Equus grevyi) can range more widely than the water\u2010dependent plains
        zebra (Equus quagga), with which it shares the same species of gastrointestinal
        nematodes. We studied how the spatial distribution of zebra dung relates to
        ranging and feeding behavior to assess parasite exposure risk in Grevy''s
        and plains zebras at a site inhabited by both zebra species. We found that
        zebra dung density declined with distance from water, Grevy''s zebra home
        ranges (excluding those of territorial males) were farther from water than
        those of plains zebras, and plains zebra grazing areas had higher dung density
        than random points while Grevy''s zebra grazing areas did not, suggesting
        a greater exposure risk in plains zebras associated with their water dependence.
        Fecal egg counts increased with home range proximity to water for both species,
        but the response was stronger in plains zebras, indicating that this host
        species may be particularly vulnerable to the elevated exposure risk close
        to water. We further ran experiments on microclimatic effects on dung infectivity
        and showed that fewer nematode eggs embryonated in dung in the sun than in
        the shade. However, only 5% of the zebra dung on the landscape was in shade,
        indicating that the microclimatic effects of shade on the density of infective
        larvae is not a major influence on exposure risk dynamics. Ranging constraints
        based on water requirements appear to be key mediators of nematode parasite
        exposure in free\u2010ranging equids.", "venue": "Ecology and Evolution",

        Plains zebras (Equus quagga) possess many of the social organization and life
        history traits found to favour infanticide. However, most documented cases
        are from captive animals, while it has not been detected in studies of free-ranging

        reproductive biology of plains zebras relates to this behaviour, and how female\u2013female
        cooperation between non-kin can operate as an effective counterstrategy.",

        risk and survival of schooling prey", "abstract": "Predation is one of the
        main evolutionary drivers of social grouping. While it is well appreciated
        that predation risk is likely not shared equally among individuals within
        groups, its detailed quantification has remained difficult due to the speed
        of attacks and the highly dynamic nature of collective prey response. Here,
        using high-resolution tracking of solitary predators (Northern pike) hunting
        schooling fish (golden shiners), we not only provide insights into predator
        decision-making, but show which key spatial and kinematic features of predator
        and prey predict the risk of individuals to be targeted and to survive attacks.
        We found that pike tended to stealthily approach the largest groups, and were
        often already inside the school when launching their attack, making prey in
        this frontal \u2018strike zone\u2019 the most vulnerable to be targeted. From
        the prey\u2019s perspective, those fish in central locations, but relatively
        far from, and less aligned with, neighbours, were most likely to be targeted.
        While the majority of attacks were successful (70%), targeted individuals
        that did manage to avoid being captured exhibited a higher maximum acceleration
        response just before the attack and were further away from the pike\u2018s
        head. Our results highlight the crucial interplay between predators\u2019

        in Kenya", "abstract": "The success of market-based mechanisms in reducing
        conflicts and internalizing externalities depends on their ability to clarify
        property rights amongst heterogenous resource users. We investigate the effectiveness
        of novel markets in achieving their goals using the case study of grazing
        markets in Laikipia County, Kenya. In this system, sheep- and goat (shoat)-
        and cattle-rearing pastoralists negotiate land access for cattle with neighboring
        cattle ranchers. Using data on pastoralists\u2019 livestock and contracting
        preferences and a model of pastoral herd management, we show that contracting
        for cattle grazing access on private property alters relative input shadow
        prices for grazing resources in communal pastoral lands, ultimately resulting
        in relieved cattle grazing pressure. However, the permitting process is less
        attractive to pastoralists who prefer rearing shoats instead of cattle. These
        shoat-rearing pastoralists instead fill some of the vacated space with shoats
        instead of purchasing permits themselves. This leakage offsets some of the
        conservation benefits arising from the contracting program and results in
        a greater share of shoats in the communal herd mix. Approximately 0.59 cows\u2019
        worth of free space persists on the commons per permit sold, indicating reduced
        grazing pressure, but this represents a small proportion (3.8%) of the total
        livestock in the system. The narrow introduction of the cattle-focused permit
        market and lack of strong management institutions on the commons dampen the
        permitting program\u2019s conservation benefits, necessitating further interventions.
        Alleviating these factors and dramatically scaling up the program has the
        potential to turn the permitting system into a successful conservation tool.",

        "title": "Social dilemmas of sociality due to beneficial and costly contagion",
        "abstract": "Levels of sociality in nature vary widely. Some species are solitary;
        others live in family groups; some form complex multi-family societies. Increased
        levels of social interaction can allow for the spread of useful innovations
        and beneficial information, but can also facilitate the spread of harmful
        contagions, such as infectious diseases. It is natural to assume that these
        contagion processes shape the evolution of complex social systems, but an
        explicit account of the dynamics of sociality under selection pressure imposed
        by contagion remains elusive. We consider a model for the evolution of sociality
        strategies in the presence of both a beneficial and costly contagion. We study
        the dynamics of this model at three timescales: using a susceptible-infectious-susceptible
        (SIS) model to describe contagion spread for given sociality strategies, a
        replicator equation to study the changing fractions of two different levels
        of sociality, and an adaptive dynamics approach to study the long-time evolution
        of the population level of sociality. For a wide range of assumptions about
        the benefits and costs of infection, we identify a social dilemma: the evolutionarily-stable
        sociality strategy (ESS) is distinct from the collective optimum\u2014the
        level of sociality that would be best for all individuals. In particular,
        the ESS level of social interaction is greater (respectively less) than the
        social optimum when the good contagion spreads more (respectively less) readily
        than the bad contagion. Our results shed light on how contagion shapes the
        evolution of social interaction, but reveals that evolution may not necessarily
        lead populations to social structures that are good for any or all.", "venue":

        for species detection, 3D model fitting, and metric learning in one pipeline
        to perform individual animal identification from photographs by exploiting
        unique coat patterns. This is the first work to attempt this and, compared
        to traditional 2D bounding box or segmentation based CNN identification pipelines,
        the approach provides effective and explicit view-point normalisation and
        allows for a straight forward visualisation of the learned biometric population

        applicable to open set and zero shot re-identification scenarios. We apply
        the proposed approach to individual Grevy''s zebra (Equus grevyi) identification
        and show in a small study on the SMALST dataset that the use of 3D model fitting
        can indeed benefit performance. In particular, back-projected textures from
        3D fitted models improve identification accuracy from 48.0% to 56.8% compared
        to 2D bounding box approaches for the dataset. Whilst the study is far too

        "title": "Evaluating expert\u2010based habitat suitability information of
        terrestrial mammals with GPS\u2010tracking data", "abstract": "Abstract Aim
        Macroecological studies that require habitat suitability data for many species
        often derive this information from expert opinion. However, expert\u2010based
        information is inherently subjective and thus prone to errors. The increasing
        availability of GPS tracking data offers opportunities to evaluate and supplement
        expert\u2010based information with detailed empirical evidence. Here, we compared
        expert\u2010based habitat suitability information from the International Union
        for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with habitat suitability information derived
        from GPS\u2010tracking data of 1,498 individuals from 49 mammal species. Location
        Worldwide. Time period 1998\u20132021. Major taxa studied Forty\u2010nine
        terrestrial mammal species. Methods Using GPS data, we estimated two measures
        of habitat suitability for each individual animal: proportional habitat use
        (proportion of GPS locations within a habitat type), and selection ratio (habitat
        use relative to its availability). For each individual we then evaluated whether
        the GPS\u2010based habitat suitability measures were in agreement with the
        IUCN data. To that end, we calculated the probability that the ranking of
        empirical habitat suitability measures was in agreement with IUCN''s classification
        into suitable, marginal and unsuitable habitat types. Results IUCN habitat
        suitability data were in accordance with the GPS data (>\u200995% probability
        of agreement) for 33 out of 49 species based on proportional habitat use estimates
        and for 25 out of 49 species based on selection ratios. In addition, 37 and
        34 species had a >\u200950% probability of agreement based on proportional
        habitat use and selection ratios, respectively. Main conclusions We show how
        GPS\u2010tracking data can be used to evaluate IUCN habitat suitability data.
        Our findings indicate that for the majority of species included in this study,
        it is appropriate to use IUCN habitat suitability data in macroecological
        studies. Furthermore, we show that GPS\u2010tracking data can be used to identify
        and prioritize species and habitat types for re\u2010evaluation of IUCN habitat
        suitability data.", "venue": "Global Ecology and Biogeography", "year": 2022,

        for groups to outperform the cognitive capabilities of even highly skilled
        individuals, known as the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d, is crucial to the
        functioning of democratic institutions. In recent years, increasing polarization
        has led to concern about its effects on the accuracy of electorates, juries,
        courts, and congress. While there is empirical evidence of collective wisdom
        in partisan crowds, a general theory has remained elusive. Central to the
        challenge is the difficulty of disentangling the effect of limited interaction
        between opposing groups (homophily) from their tendency to hold opposing viewpoints
        (partisanship). To overcome this challenge, we develop an agent-based model
        of collective wisdom parameterized by the experimentally-measured behaviour
        of participants across the political spectrum. In doing so, we reveal that
        differences across the political spectrum in how individuals express and respond
        to knowledge interact with the structure of the network to either promote
        or undermine wisdom. We verify these findings experimentally and construct
        a more general theoretical framework. Finally, we provide evidence that incidental,
        context-specific differences across the political spectrum likely determine
        the impact of polarization. Overall, our results show that whether polarized
        groups benefit from collective wisdom is generally predictable but highly
        context-specific.", "venue": "Collective Intelligence", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Staying Alive: Long-Term Success of Bottlenose Dolphin Interventions
        in Southwest Florida", "abstract": "Small cetaceans face persistent threats
        from fisheries interactions, making effective mitigation a priority for conservation.
        In southwest Florida, interactions come primarily from small-scale recreational
        hook and line and trap/pot fisheries, with regional stranding network partners
        working with federal agency managers to assess and intervene as possible in
        cases of live animal entanglement. Evaluating success of intervention cases
        is difficult due to financial and logistical constraints which may preclude
        detailed follow-up monitoring. Survival over the initial 6 weeks post-release
        has been used as a marker of short-term success for small-cetacean rescue
        and/or rehabilitation cases. Early intervention prior to stranding, especially
        via remote disentanglement or rescue and immediate re-release onsite, can
        save entangled free-ranging dolphins facing life-threatening anthropogenic
        injuries. However, given the costs associated with interventions, it is important
        to understand the benefits of these endeavors not only to save individuals,
        but also to establish if and how saved individuals contribute to social functioning,
        survival and reproduction within small, resident populations facing multiple
        concurrent threats. Here we provide evidence from 27 well-documented common
        bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) intervention cases during 1985\u20132019
        where follow-up monitoring over multiple years sheds light on the longer-term
        success of these efforts and potential benefits to local populations. Nearly
        all rescued individuals (92%) survived longer than 6 weeks post-release (mean
        minimum survival period = 5 years, range 0\u201335 years), with 13 still observed
        frequently within their prior resident communities, in good physical health,
        and engaging in normal behavior. Survivorship rates did not decline substantially
        between 1 and 5 years post-rescue, meaning survival beyond 1 year may be a
        useful benchmark of long-term success. Rescued females that reached reproductive
        maturity (n = 4) have produced 12 post-intervention offspring to date. Social
        network analysis and demographic modeling applied to cases from the long-term
        resident community in Sarasota Bay confirmed that animals maintain social
        connections post-intervention and that interventions result in higher population
        growth rates. While not every intervention succeeds, this study demonstrates
        the conservation value of pre-stranding interventions which allow individuals
        that otherwise would be lost to remain viable and productive members of local
        populations when prevention of anthropogenic injury is not possible.", "venue":

        of 30 populations of hindgut fermenters (equids) and ruminants across biomes.
        Selection for intermediate forage biomass was negatively related to body size,
        regardless of digestive system. Selection for proximity to surface water was
        stronger for equids relative to ruminants, regardless of body size. To be
        more generalisable, we suggest that the FMH explicitly incorporate contingencies
        in body size and digestive system, with small-bodied ruminants selecting more
        strongly for potential energy intake, and hindgut fermenters selecting more

        wildlife herbivores was studied in Samburu-Laikipia landscape. The study sites
        included; Mpala and Oljogi, both commercial ranches in Laikipia district;
        Oldonyiro and Kipsing community areas in Isiolo district; West Gate Conservancy,
        Ngaroni Community area, Kalama Community area and Sessia-Barsalinga Community
        area in Samburu district; and Buffalo Spring National Reserve and Samburu
        National Reserve both protected areas in the landscape. The objectives of
        the study were: 1) Determine the influence of different land use on seasonal
        abundances and distribution wildlife species and 2) Examine the influence
        of livestock, human settlements and water on wildlife species in Samburu-Laikipia
        landscape. Distance sampling was used to estimate wildlife, livestock and
        bomas densities. Distance to nearest water was projected from GPS coordinates
        for both wildlife and livestock sighting using ARCGIS. Our analysis showed
        non-uniform distributions of wildlife groups across the Samburu-Laikipia ecosystem
        largely driven by seasonal rainfall patterns and land use types. Like predicted,
        most wildlife groups occurred in higher abundances on protected areas, Laikipia
        commercial ranches and community conservancies unlike in community grazing
        areas in both dry and wet season. However, large grazers increased substantially
        in community grazing areas over the wet season when livestock grazing was
        heavy, stimulating growth of short annuals plants of high-quality nutrients.
        Human activities had negative influences on all wildlife groups. Our findings
        indicate that the type of land -use influenced herbivore distribution and
        abundance in Samburu-Laikipia landscape. This suggests that human activities,
        including pastoralism, in conjunction with season rainfall patterns and land-use
        shape herbivore distribution and abundance in the area. Conservation strategies
        for successfully increasing survival of wildlife therefore, requires maintenance
        of a mixture of land-use types with well controlled and sustainable development.",

        "title": "Bothersome Flies: How Free-Ranging Horses Reduce Harm While Maintaining
        Nutrition", "abstract": "The horses of Shackleford Banks, NC, United States
        are harassed by many species of biting flies. Apart from being a nuisance,
        their bites can lead to blood loss and transmit disease. As a result, these
        horses tend to avoid areas where fly abundances are high. Like other free-ranging
        horse populations, environmental factors such as low wind speeds and high
        temperatures increase fly loads per horse. Similarly, coat color matters since
        darker horses attract more flies than lighter ones, especially on hot sunny
        days. Many horse populations reduce per capita fly loads by living in large
        groups or by bunching tightly together. Shackleford horses do so, too, but
        also use wind speed differences among habitats to modulate fly numbers. By
        adopting a systematic pattern of moving between habitats such that they only
        visit a habitat when wind speed is high enough to keep fly harassment to a
        tolerable level, they can avoid being bitten while continuing to forage. Typically,
        they begin the day foraging on the salt marshes where fly abundance is inherently
        low and are lowered further by faint early morning breezes. Later in the morning,
        horses move to grassy patches (swales) when increasing wind speed reduces
        fly landings there to levels found on the marshes. Later still, when wind
        speeds peak, horses begin foraging among the sand dunes. At this point wind
        speeds are high enough so that horses using any habitat will be minimally

        Risk in Schooling Prey", "abstract": "Predation is one of the main drivers
        of animal grouping. However, predation risk is not shared equally within groups.
        Despite long-standing theoretical work and strong empirical insights, very
        little work has examined the real-time dynamics of predators attacking groups
        of prey nor quantified the features that predict prey predation risk and survival.
        Here we used high resolution tracking of Northern pike (Esox lucius) attacking
        large schools of prey (golden shiner fish, Notemigonus crysoleucas) to get
        a mechanistic quantification of predation at every stage of the attack. We
        found that pike tended to attack the groups head-on, but did so stealthily,
        often striking only when partly within the school. From the predator\u2019s
        perspective, relative position to the prey was the most important feature,
        with shiners very close and directly in front of the pike being most at risk.
        From the prey\u2019s perspective, we found that central individuals, with
        relatively low local neighbour density and alignment, face increased risk.
        While the majority of attacks were successful, escape was associated with
        individuals achieving high maximum movement speeds, relative to others. Our
        study highlights both predator attack strategy and prey behaviour are key
        factors underlying the predation risk of grouping prey, and our results contradict
        the long-held assertion arising from Hamilton\u2019s \u201cselfish herd\u201d
        concept that central positions are safer. To ultimately understand the cost-benefits
        that underly the evolution of animal grouping it is thus key to consider the
        multifaceted, and dynamical, nature of predator-prey relationships.", "venue":

        within and between adjacent and distant systems (metacouplings) are rarely
        studied in fisheries despite their prevalence and policy relevance. We filled
        this knowledge gap by using network models to identify how the severe acute
        respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has rewired couplings
        and reshaped resilience of Fishadelphia, a community-supported fishery program
        (CSF) in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. As abstractions illustrating interactions
        among supply-chain actors, networks are helpful for characterizing flows and
        assessing resilience to disturbances such as those induced by the SARS-CoV-2
        pandemic. Since Fall 2018, 18 seafood (finfish and shellfish) species totaling
        6273 lbs have flowed from harvesters (n = 4), to processors (n = 2), to a
        distributor, to retailers (n = 2), and finally to customers (n = 183). The

        seafood flow quantity (\u221225%), species diversity in the marketplace (\u221267%),
        and species per supplier (\u221250%) before stopping flows in mid-March 2020,
        when Fishadelphia closed for 3 months. Models of network optimality indicated
        that the pandemic fragmented metacouplings that previously allowed multiple
        seafood suppliers to provide diverse products to customers. However, demand-side
        resilience increased through dispersed, socially distanced, efficient seafood
        delivery that expanded the customer base and generally increased customer
        satisfaction. This resilience dichotomy\u2014wherein the post-closure network
        was less resilient than the pre-closure network in supply-side species diversity,
        but more resilient in demand-side social distancing, delivery efficiency,

        distant systems (metacouplings)\u2014to illustrate how fisheries catches were
        locally, regionally, and globally interconnected in 1950\u20132014, totaling
        5.8 billion metric tons and increasing by 298% (tonnage) and 431% (monetary
        value) over this time period. Catches by nations in their own EEZs (largest
        in Peru) and adjacent EEZs (largest in Indonesia) constituted 86% of worldwide
        catches, growing in 1950\u20131996 but declining in 1997\u20132014. In contrast,
        catches in distant EEZs and the high seas\u2014largest in Morocco, Mauritania,
        and Canada\u2014peaked in 1973 and have since represented 9\u201321% of annual

        responses and offspring survival in feral horses (Equus caballus)", "abstract":
        "Acoustic signaling plays an important role in mother-offspring recognition
        and subsequent bond-formation. It remains unclear, however, if mothers and
        offspring use acoustic signaling in the same ways and for the same reasons
        throughout the juvenile stage, particularly after mutual recognition has been
        adequately established. Moreover, despite its critical role in mother-offspring
        bond formation, research explicitly linking mother-infant communication strategies
        to offspring survival are lacking. We examined the communicative patterns
        of mothers and offspring in the feral horse (Equus caballus) to better understand
        1) the nature of mother-offspring communication throughout the first year
        of development; 2) the function(s) of mother- vs. offspring-initiated communication
        and; 3) the importance of mare and foal communication to offspring survival.
        We found that 1) mares and foals differ in when and how they initiate communication;
        2) the outcomes of mare- vs. foal-initiated communication events consistently
        differ; and 3) the communicative patterns between mares and their foals can
        be important for offspring survival to one year of age. Moreover, given the
        importance of maternal activity to offspring behavior and subsequent survival,
        we submit that our data are uniquely positioned to address the long-debated
        question: do the behaviors exhibited during the juvenile stage (by both mothers
        and their young) confer delayed or immediate benefits to offspring? In summary,
        we aimed to better understand 1) the dynamics of mother-offspring communication,
        2) whether mother-offspring communicative patterns were important to offspring
        survival, and 3) the implications of our research regarding the function of
        the mammalian juvenile stage. Our results demonstrate that we have achieved
        those aims.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2020, "referenceCount": 67, "citationCount":

        "Marine fisheries are social-ecological systems important for human health
        and livelihoods. However, research approaches that consider human\u2013nature
        interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant fisheries are
        scarce. As such, we measured and modeled marine fisheries catches at local
        and regional scales over 65 years (1950\u20132014), assessed cross-scalar
        interactions among fishing types (artisanal, subsistence, industrial, recreational),
        and predicted future catches using the metacoupling framework, a new approach
        for evaluating human-nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant
        fisheries (metacouplings). Across taxa examined (mahi-mahi [Coryphaena hippurus],
        Atlantic bluefin tuna [Thunnus thynnus], cods [Gadidae]), 75% of catches (8.5
        million metric tons [MMT]) were made by nations in their own exclusive economic
        zones (EEZs; Type 1 fishing). However, catches in adjacent EEZs (Type 2 fishing,
        1.0 MMT) and distant EEZs and the high seas (Type 3 fishing, 1.9 MMT) increased
        substantially for all taxa at certain times, becoming consistently important
        for tuna and cods after 1980. Moreover, Types 1\u20133 fishing interacted
        in ways that affect humans differentially across fisheries. For instance,
        tuna artisanal and subsistence catches (Type 1) decreased with increasing
        Type 2 and Type 3 industrial fishing, respectively. Cod subsistence catches
        declined with increasing Type 2/3 industrial fishing and Type 1 artisanal
        fishing, whereas fishing-type interactions were largely positive for mahi-mahi,
        causing catches to increase across sectors. Overall, metacouplings affect
        humans in positive and negative ways that vary across scales and fisheries
        systems, galvanizing the need for metacoupling-informed fisheries research,
        policy, and management programs.", "venue": "Frontiers in Marine Science",

        the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the globe coerced their
        citizens to adhere to preventive health behaviours, aiming to reduce the effective
        reproduction numbers of the virus. Driven by game theoretic considerations
        and inspired by the work of US National Research Council''s Committee on Food
        Habits (1943) during WWII, and the post-WWII Yale Communication Research Program,
        the present research shows how to achieve enhanced adherence to health regulations
        without coercion. To this aim, we combine three elements: (i) indirect measurements,
        (ii) personalized interventions, and (iii) attitude changing treatments (IMPACT).
        We find that a cluster of short interventions, such as elaboration on possible
        consequences, induction of cognitive dissonance, addressing next of kin and
        similar others and receiving advice following severity judgements, improves
        individuals'' health-preserving attitudes. We propose extending the use of
        IMPACT under closure periods and during the resumption of social and economic
        activities under COVID-19 pandemic, since efficient and lasting adherence
        should rely on personal attitudes rather than on coercion alone. Finally,
        we point to the opportunity of international cooperation generated by the
        pandemic.", "venue": "Royal Society Open Science", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

        40% over the last three decades, and the geographic ranges of the species
        (previously believed to be one, now defined as four species) have been significantly
        reduced or altered. With substantial changes in land uses, loss of habitat,
        declining abundance, translocations, and data gaps, the existing geographic
        range maps for giraffe need to be updated. 2 . We performed a review of existing
        giraffe range data, including aerial and ground observations of giraffe, existing
        geographic range maps, and available literature. The information we collected
        was discussed with and validated by subject-matter experts. Our updates may
        serve to correct inaccuracies or omissions in the baseline map, or may reflect
        actual changes in the distribution of giraffe. 3 . Relative to the 2016 List
        Assessment range map, the updated geographic range maps show a 5.6% decline
        in the range area of all giraffe taxa combined. The ranges of Giraffa camelopardalis
        (northern giraffe) and Giraffa tippelskirchi (Masai giraffe) de-creased in

        (41696 km 2 ) of the range of Giraffa reticulata (reticulated giraffe) had
        not been included in the original geographic range map and has now been added.

        Can Conservation Value Be Enhanced?", "abstract": "Predator restorations often
        result in apparent competition, where co-occurring prey populations experience
        asymmetric predation pressure driven by predator preferences. In many rangeland
        ecosystems, livestock share the landscape with wildlife, including ungulates
        and the large carnivores that consume them. We examined whether apparent competition
        reorganized prey communities following restoration of lions (Panthera leo)
        to a savanna ecosystem, and whether and how livestock management could alter
        this indirect interaction between lions and their prey. Three lines of evidence
        supported the hypothesis that Jackson\u2019s hartebeest (Alcelaphus bucelaphus
        lelwel; an ungulate of conservation concern) are suppressed via lion-mediated
        apparent competition. First, hartebeest exhibited an Allee effect where they
        were exposed to lions, but displayed negative density-dependent population
        growth where they were protected from lions. Second, spatial overlap between
        plains zebra (Equus burchelli; the primary prey of lions) and hartebeest further
        exacerbated lion predation on hartebeest. Finally, hartebeest were killed
        selectively by lions, whereas zebra were killed by lions in proportion to
        their abundance. We then tested whether glades (nutrient-rich hotspots created
        by abandoned cattle [Bos indicus] corrals) could be used to manipulate top-down
        control of hartebeest via their influence on the spatial distribution of zebra.
        Zebra aggregated at glades, and survival of hartebeest increased with increasing
        distance from glades, suggesting that corrals may be placed on the landscape
        away from hartebeest to create spatial refuges from lions. Our findings demonstrate
        how informed placement of livestock corrals can be used to manipulate the
        spatial distribution of primary prey (zebra), thereby reducing apparent competition
        suffered by hartebeest. Our work further provides an example of how integrating
        apparent competition theory with proactive livestock management can improve
        conservation efforts in multiple-use landscapes.", "venue": "Frontiers in

        (Capra aegagrus hircus)", "abstract": "Many social animal species produce
        vocalizations believed to facilitate group contraction when one or more group
        members have become distant. However, the mechanisms underlying this function
        remain unclear for many species. We examined this question with data on a
        semi-free ranging group of 16 adult domesticated goats (Capra aegagrus hircus)
        inhabiting Tsaobis Nature Park, Namibia. All goats wore dataloggers consisting
        of a GPS and audio recorder for 5-6 hours per day for 10 days, providing continuous
        data on their geolocations and vocal communication. We found that callers
        were farther from the group centroid than expected by chance and that call
        production was associated with the cessation of group expansion and subsequent
        group contraction. We did not find strong evidence for antiphonal call exchange
        between distant and core group members. Rather, we found that (i) call production
        by distant group members is associated with a significant reduction of group
        movement away from the caller, and (ii) call production by core group members
        is associated with greater, though not significantly greater, group movement
        towards the caller. These findings suggest that calls may be used by distant,
        and potentially core, group members to facilitate the contraction of group
        spread. Results from our study clarify the mechanisms through which social
        animals can regulate collective movement behavior and the specific role that
        vocalizations play in this process.", "venue": "Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution",

        with predictions of effective population size", "abstract": "Effective population
        size, a central concept in conservation biology, is now routinely estimated
        from genetic surveys and can also be theoretically predicted from demographic,
        life\u2010history, and mating\u2010system data. By evaluating the consistency
        of theoretical predictions with empirically estimated effective size, insights
        can be gained regarding life\u2010history characteristics and the relative
        impact of different life\u2010history traits on genetic drift. These insights
        can be used to design and inform management strategies aimed at increasing
        effective population size. We demonstrated this approach by addressing the
        conservation of a reintroduced population of Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus).
        We estimated the variance effective size (Nev) from genetic data ( N ev =24.3
        ) and formulated predictions for the impacts on Nev of demography, polygyny,
        female variance in lifetime reproductive success (RS), and heritability of
        female RS. By contrasting the genetic estimation with theoretical predictions,
        we found that polygyny was the strongest factor affecting genetic drift because
        only when accounting for polygyny were predictions consistent with the genetically
        measured Nev. The comparison of effective\u2010size estimation and predictions
        indicated that 10.6% of the males mated per generation when heritability of
        female RS was unaccounted for (polygyny responsible for 81% decrease in Nev)
        and 19.5% mated when female RS was accounted for (polygyny responsible for
        67% decrease in Nev). Heritability of female RS also affected Nev; hf2=0.91
        (heritability responsible for 41% decrease in Nev). The low effective size
        is of concern, and we suggest that management actions focus on factors identified
        as strongly affecting Nev , namely, increasing the availability of artificial
        water sources to increase number of dominant males contributing to the gene
        pool. This approach, evaluating life\u2010history hypotheses in light of their
        impact on effective population size, and contrasting predictions with genetic
        measurements, is a general, applicable strategy that can be used to inform
        conservation practice.", "venue": "Conservation Biology", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Resolving a conservation dilemma: Vulnerable lions eating endangered
        zebras", "abstract": "When predators are removed or suppressed for generations,
        prey populations tend to increase and when predators are re-introduced, prey
        densities should fall back to pre-control levels. In cases of apparent competition
        where there are alternate abundant and rare prey species, rare species may
        decline further than expected or disappear altogether. Recently, concern about
        the impact of recovering predator populations on wildlife in Laikipia County,
        Kenya, has led to questions of whether lions (Panthera leo, IUCN Red List
        Vulnerable) exert top-down pressure on Grevy\u2019s zebra (Equus grevyi, IUCN
        Red List Endangered). We examined effects of lion predation on Plain\u2019s
        zebra (E. quagga, IUCN Red List Near Threatened) and Grevy\u2019s zebra populations
        in a 2,105 km2 area defined by lion movements. We used line transect surveys
        to estimate density of Grevy\u2019s (0.71/km2) and Plain\u2019s (15.9/km2)
        zebras, and satellite telemetry to measure movements for lions and both zebras.
        We tracked lions to potential feeding sites to estimate predation rates on
        zebras. We compared field-based estimates of predation rates on both zebras
        to random gas models of encounters that result in predation to ask if lions
        prey preferentially on Grevy\u2019s zebra at a sufficient rate to drive population
        declines. Lions preyed on Grevy\u2019s zebra significantly less than expected
        in 15 of 16 (94%) scenarios considered and lions preyed on Plain\u2019s zebras
        as expected or significantly less than expected in 15 of 16 scenarios. Population
        trend of Grevy\u2019s zebra indicates that the Kenya population may be stabilizing.
        Recruitment rate to the population has tripled since 2004, making it unlikely
        that lions are having an impact on Grevy\u2019s zebras. In Laikipia County,
        competitive displacement by livestock (Livestock: Grevy\u2019s zebra ratio
        = 864:1) and interference competition for grass with Plain\u2019s zebra (Plain\u2019s
        zebra:Grevy\u2019s zebra ratio = 22:1) are most likely the predominant threats
        to Grevy\u2019s Zebra recovery.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2018, "referenceCount":

        mutualisms, ants establish colonies in hollow thorns, leaf pouches, or other
        specialized structures on their host plants, which they then defend from herbivores.
        Resource heterogeneity could affect the maintenance of these mutualisms if
        it leads to one or both partners altering their investment in the interaction.
        Such a phenomenon may be especially pertinent to the Acacia\u2013ant mutualism
        found in East African savannas, where termite mounds have a profound effect
        on the spatial structuring of resources used by both plants and ants. Here,
        we examined whether the proximity to termite mounds of Acacia drepanolobium
        trees is associated with variation in the behavior of one of their ant associates,
        Crematogaster nigriceps. We found that ant colonies near termite mounds had
        decreased aggressive responses to simulated herbivory as well as increased

        paper proposes a 5-component detection pipeline for use in a computer vision-based
        animal recognition system. The end result of our proposed pipeline is a collection
        of novel annotations of interest (AoI) with species and view-point labels.
        These AoIs, for example, could be fed as the focused input data into an appearance-based
        animal identification system. The goal of our method is to increase the reliability
        and automation of animal censusing studies and to provide better ecological
        information to conservationists. Our method is able to achieve a localization
        mAP of 81.67%, a species and viewpoint annotation classification accuracy
        of 94.28% and 87.11%, respectively, and an AoI accuracy of 72.75% across 6
        animal species of interest. We also introduce the Wildlife Image and Localization
        Dataset (WILD), which contains 5,784 images and 12,007 labeled annotations
        across 28 classification species and a variety of challenging, real-world

        "title": "Moving in the Anthropocene: Global reductions in terrestrial mammalian
        movements", "abstract": "Restrictions on roaming Until the past century or
        so, the movement of wild animals was relatively unrestricted, and their travels
        contributed substantially to ecological processes. As humans have increasingly
        altered natural habitats, natural animal movements have been restricted. Tucker
        et al. examined GPS locations for more than 50 species. In general, animal
        movements were shorter in areas with high human impact, likely owing to changed
        behaviors and physical limitations. Besides affecting the species themselves,
        such changes could have wider effects by limiting the movement of nutrients
        and altering ecological interactions. Science, this issue p. 466 Human alterations
        of the landscape shorten the distances traveled by individual animals. Animal
        movement is fundamental for ecosystem functioning and species survival, yet
        the effects of the anthropogenic footprint on animal movements have not been
        estimated across species. Using a unique GPS-tracking database of 803 individuals
        across 57 species, we found that movements of mammals in areas with a comparatively
        high human footprint were on average one-half to one-third the extent of their
        movements in areas with a low human footprint. We attribute this reduction
        to behavioral changes of individual animals and to the exclusion of species
        with long-range movements from areas with higher human impact. Global loss
        of vagility alters a key ecological trait of animals that affects not only
        population persistence but also ecosystem processes such as predator-prey
        interactions, nutrient cycling, and disease transmission.", "venue": "Science",

        "abstract": "Understanding how humans and other animals behave in response
        to changes in their environments is vital for predicting population dynamics
        and the trajectory of coupled social-ecological systems. Here, we present
        a novel framework for identifying emergent social behaviours in foragers (including
        humans engaged in fishing or hunting) in predator-prey contexts based on the
        exploration difficulty and exploitation potential of a renewable natural resource.
        A qualitative framework is introduced that predicts when foragers should behave
        territorially, search collectively, act independently or switch among these
        states. To validate it, we derived quantitative predictions from two models
        of different structure: a generic mathematical model, and a lattice-based
        evolutionary model emphasising exploitation and exclusion costs. These models
        independently identified that the exploration difficulty and exploitation
        potential of the natural resource controls the social behaviour of resource
        exploiters. Our theoretical predictions were finally compared to a diverse
        set of empirical cases focusing on fisheries and aquatic organisms across
        a range of taxa, substantiating the framework''s predictions. Understanding
        social behaviour for given social-ecological characteristics has important
        implications, particularly for the design of governance structures and regulations
        to move exploited systems, such as fisheries, towards sustainability. Our
        framework provides concrete steps in this direction.", "venue": "Ecology Letters",

        "title": "Striping patterns may not influence social interactions and mating
        in zebra: Observations from melanic zebra in South Africa", "abstract": "Colouration
        serves many functions in animals including crypsis, aposematism, mimicry,
        intraspecific communication, communication between species and thermoregulation
        (Caro, Caswell Stoddard, & Stuard-Fox, 2017). On occasions, abnormalities
        or discontinuous variations in colouration and/or patterning of an individual
        within a population can occur, leading to albinism (Osinga, \u2018t Hart,
        & Vader, 2010), leucism (Reisinger, Mufanadzo, de Bruyn, & Bester, 2009) or
        melanism (Eizirik et al., 2003; Majerus, 1998). Melanism, a rare condition
        occurring when a group of pigments (pheomelanin or eumelanin) is overproduced,
        has been reported in a variety of mammal species. Zebra (Equus spp.) are widely
        distributed in southern Africa in a variety of ecosystems with two species
        found in South Africa: the plains zebra (Equus quagga) and the Cape mountain
        zebra (Equus zebra) (Caro, 2005; Marais, Nel, Bertschinger, Schoeman, & Zimmerman,
        2007). These animals have distinctive white and black striping patterns which
        can vary regionally from heavy black and white striping over the entire body
        to areas of reduced stripe coverage with thinner and lighter stripes (Rubenstein,
        2011). Pigmentation decisions occur at around 3\u20135 weeks of development,
        while the hairs that show the pattern do not grow until about 6 months (Bard,
        1981). Many hypotheses exist to explain striping in zebra; including camouflage
        against predators, disrupting predatory attacks, thermoregulation, social
        cohesion and avoidance of ectoparasite attacks from biting flies and other
        insects (Blaho et al., 2012, 2013; Caro, 2016; Egri et al., 2012; Horvath
        et al., 2010; Larison et al., 2015; Melin, Kline, Hiramatsu, & Caro, 2016;
        Ruxton, 2002). This manuscript describes two cases of melanic plains zebra
        observed inside the Mkambati Nature Reserve in the Eastern Cape Province of
        South Africa. This reserve of 7,736 ha is managed by the Eastern Cape and
        Tourism Agency (ECPTA) and is located approximately 25 km south of the coastal
        town of Port Edward (KwaZulu-Natal). Zebra were introduced in the reserve
        in 1979, along with several other ungulate species. At that time of introduction,
        no large predators were present and none are present today (De Villiers &
        Costello, 2006). During two field excursions (3 June 2015\u201324 June 2015
        and 20 November 2016\u20137 December 2016), opportunistic photographs of melanic
        zebra were taken from as close to the animal as possible (approximately 20
        m) and from both sides. The number of animals in each melanic zebra\u2019s
        group, defined as all animals within 100 m of each other, was also noted and
        photographed for later identification. In 2016, observations were taken at
        least every 2 days, when animals were within viewable range. To quantify the
        colouration patterns, the amount of black/saturated area and percentage of
        striped areas were visually estimated for different parts of the body (head
        and neck, flank, rump and legs) to the nearest 5% or 10% depending on photograph
        quality. The intensity of the black colouration was scored as \u201clight\u201d
        (<30%), \u201cmedium\u201d (30%\u201360%) or \u201cdark\u201d (>60%). Where
        there was striping, the number of stripes was counted and the shape of the
        stripes was described.", "venue": "", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 30,

        Declines in Scavenging Raptors", "abstract": "Lack of suitable nesting trees
        is an increasingly common issue for avian conservation given rampant habitat
        and tree destruction around the world. In the African savannah, habitat loss
        and particularly tree damage caused by elephants have been suggested as possible
        factors in the decline of large bird species. Given the recent declines of
        vultures and other scavenging raptors, it is critical to understand if nest
        availability is a limiting factor for these threatened populations. Loss of
        woodland, partially due to elephant populations, has been reported for the
        Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. Data on characteristics of trees used for nesting
        were collected for White-backed, Lappet-faced, White-headed vulture, and Tawny
        eagle nests in Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya. Nest tree characteristics
        were compared with the distribution of a random subsample of trees to assess
        nest preferences and determine suitability of available trees. Nearest neighbor
        distances were estimated as well as availability of preferred nesting trees
        to determine if tree availability is a limiting factor for tree-nesting vultures.
        Tree availability was found to greatly exceed nesting needs for African vultures
        and Tawny eagles. We thus conclude that on a landscape scale, tree availability
        is not a limiting factor for any of the species considered here (White-backed,
        Lappet-faced, White-headed vultures, and Tawny eagles).\r\n\r\nThis article

        the health of an animal population. A census results in a population size
        estimate, which is a fundamental metric for deciding the demographic and conservation

        in the ease and flexibility of studying animal movement patterns, yet barriers
        remain to the widespread use of GPS units for animal tracking. Here, we developed
        a low-cost, logistically simple approach, deploying small and inexpensive
        GPS units to monitor cattle movements and habitat use and to assess the impact
        of cattle grazing on vegetation. Cattle were collared with i-gotU loggers
        to track fine-scale and broad-scale movements within an integrated ecosystem
        (cattle and wildlife) in Laikipia, central Kenya. At the fine scale, cattle
        exerted a significant impact on vegetation quantity and quality; increasing
        grazing intensity showed a negative relationship to grass height, but a positive
        correlation to green-up after rain. At the broad scale, cattle movement density
        varied notably by herd type and habitat availability, with acacia woodland
        and savanna grassland habitats used most predominantly. Overall, these small
        GPS loggers provided a flexible and relatively cheap method of tracking cattle
        movements, and demonstrated potential for collaring of cattle as a tool for
        monitoring ecosystem health and assisting management decisions.", "venue":

        "title": "Physiology modulates social flexibility and collective behaviour
        in equids and other large ungulates", "abstract": "Though morphologically
        very similar, equids across the extant species occupy ecological niches that
        are surprisingly non-overlapping. Occupancy of these distinct niches appears
        related to subtle physiological and behavioural adaptations which, in turn,
        correspond to significant differences in the social behaviours and emergent
        social systems characterizing the different species. Although instances of
        intraspecific behavioural variation in equids demonstrate that the same body
        plan can support a range of social structures, each of these morphologically
        similar species generally shows robust fidelity to its evolved social system.
        The pattern suggests a subtle relationship between physiological phenotypes
        and behavioural flexibility. While environmental conditions can vary widely
        within relatively short temporal or spatial scales, physiological changes
        and changes to the behaviours that regulate physiological processes, are constrained
        to longer cycles of adaptation. Physiology is then the limiting variable in
        the interaction between ecological variation and behavioural and socio-structural
        flexibility. Behavioural and socio-structural flexibility, in turn, will generate
        important feedbacks that will govern physiological function, thus creating
        a coupled web of interactions that can lead to changes in individual and collective
        behaviour. Longitudinal studies of equid and other large-bodied ungulate populations
        under environmental stress, such as those discussed here, may offer the best
        opportunities for researchers to examine, in real time, the interplay between
        individual behavioural plasticity, socio-structural flexibility, and the physiological
        and genetic changes that together produce adaptive change. This article is

        Management in an African Pastoral Landscape", "abstract": "Rangelands are
        vital for wildlife conservation and socio\u2010economic well\u2010being, but
        many face widespread degradation because in part of poor grazing management
        practices. Planned grazing management, typically involving time\u2010controlled
        rotational livestock grazing, is widely touted as a tool for promoting sustainable
        rangelands. However, real\u2010world assessments of its efficacy have been
        lacking in communal pastoral landscapes globally, and especially in Africa.
        We performed landscape\u2010scale assessment of the effects of planned grazing
        on selected vegetation, wildlife, and cattle attributes across wide\u2010ranging
        communally managed pastoral rangelands in northern Kenya. We found that planned
        grazing enhanced vegetation condition through a 17% increase in normalized
        difference vegetation index, 45\u2013234% increases in herbaceous vegetation
        foliar cover, species richness and diversity, and a 70% reduction in plant
        basal gap. In addition, planned grazing increased the presence (44%) and species
        richness (53%) of wild ungulates and improved cattle weight gain (>71%) during
        dry periods when cattle were in relatively poor condition. These changes occurred
        relatively rapidly (within 5 years) and despite grazing incursion incidents
        and higher livestock stocking rates in planned grazing areas. These results
        demonstrate, for the first time in Africa, the positive effects of planned
        grazing implementation in communal pastoral rangelands. These improvements
        can have broad implications for biodiversity conservation and pastoral livelihoods.

        grazing on wildlife. What do we really know?", "abstract": "More than a quarter
        of earth\u2019s land surface is used for grazing domestic livestock. Livestock
        grazing is generally assumed to negatively affect wildlife, however, a number
        of studies have found positive impacts as well. We conducted an evidence-based
        review of the existing literature using a series of livestock- and wildlife-related
        search words to systematically query Google Scholar and Web of Science. A
        total of 807 sources were included in the final list, including 646 primary
        sources which reported original data. The majority of studies were conducted
        in North America (338) or Europe (123), with many fewer from Africa (57),
        Australia (54), Central/South America (43), or Asia (31). Most studies examined
        birds (330) and mammals (262), with fewer including reptiles (91) or amphibians
        (58). We extracted further information from studies that included mammals
        on positive, negative, and neutral effects of livestock grazing on mammals.
        We found that livestock change vegetation structure and cover in ways important
        to small mammals, while ungulates may be affected more by interference competition
        and changes in forage quantity and quality. Community-level total abundance
        of small mammals typically declines with grazing. Species richness of small
        mammals either declines or stays the same, as many studies found a change
        in species composition from ungrazed to grazed sites while the number of species
        remained similar. Individual species responses of small mammals vary. Voles,
        harvest mice, cotton rats, and shrews show consistently negative responses
        to grazing while deer mice, kangaroo rats, ground squirrels, and lagomorphs
        show positive or variable responses. In general, species adapted to open habitats
        are often positively affected by grazing, while species needing denser cover
        are negatively affected. Studies of wild ungulates are more variable in methodology
        and quality than those for small mammals. We found more negative (n = 86)
        than positive (n = 34) ungulate responses overall, however, most studies have
        been on browsers and mixed feeders, namely deer and elk, and there is little
        available data for other groups. Although data is limited, several of the
        grazing species in Africa may show a trend toward positive responses, suggesting
        possible facilitation. For a number of species, responses varied by season.
        We find a strong need for additional research on ungulates of varying diets
        and body sizes, especially in the developing world, and across longer time
        scales to examine possible tradeoffs between competition and facilitation
        from livestock.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 106, "citationCount":

        "title": "Conservation Behavior: Anthropogenic impacts on behavior: the pros
        and cons of plasticity", "abstract": "Many threatened and endangered species
        inhabit environments where people have altered the landscape and have created
        novel and powerful selective pressures. These often disrupt \u201cbottom-up\u201d
        factors associated with resource acquisition, change \u201ctop-down\u201d
        factors involving predation or disease transmission or alter \u201cside-ways\u201d
        factors involving competitive or mutualistic interactions happening at the
        same trophic level. Since one of the basic precepts of behavioral ecology
        is that environmental conditions shape behavior, such changes should lead
        to changing responses by the species experiencing them. But this pre-supposes
        that there is enough plasticity in a species\u2019 behavioral repertoire to
        cope with the environmental change. If there is, then contingent responses
        displayed in the past may help species cope with a changing present. If the
        degree of environmental change is so great or the species has a limited ability
        to adjust its behavior, then the species could be pushed beyond its limits
        to adapt, with the stress it experiences lowering its fecundity or survival,
        leading to its demise (Chapter 4). Alternatively, the species could be pushed
        into new behavioral space, revealing novel responses. These might be sufficient
        to cope with the environmental changes, creating new evolutionary potential,
        or they could be pathological, creating unintended negative consequences that
        may at first appear benign, but in the long run may impact the species\u2019
        viability or involve cascading effects on other species. Recent reviews by
        Rubenstein (2010) and Caro and Sherman (2011, 2013) have provided insights
        into many dimensions of this problem. Caro and Sherman (2011) argue that species
        exhibit remarkable degrees of plasticity and that behavioral diversity per
        se should be added to the traditional list of attributes to be conserved \u2013
        genes, species and ecosystems. If behaviors are not conserved, then many behavioral
        variants will remain latent and unexpressed, and if given enough time, will
        vanish from a species\u2019 repertoire forever. This could potentially change
        a species\u2019 evolutionary trajectory by reducing a species\u2019 ability
        to escape from new stressors or by eliminating the possibility of conservationists
        seeding threatened populations with corrective behavioral variants. Such a
        doom and gloom scenario need not be cast in stone since dramatic changes in
        the past have often disrupted communities and altered selective pressures.
        Adaptations in the past have led to successful coping strategies and they
        can do so again going forward.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Effects of traditional pastoralism on grasshopper (Caelifera) assemblages
        in East Africa", "abstract": "In East Africa, traditional pastoralists increase
        landscape heterogeneity by creating traditional livestock corrals (bomas).
        When these bomas are abandoned, they serve as long-term hot spots of increased
        nutrients and unique vegetation. However, the effect of bomas on insect populations
        is unclear. Grasshopper (Suborder Caelifera) assemblages are thought to reflect
        vegetation, and within Caelifera, the subfamily Oedipodinae is known to be
        associated with degraded areas. We sampled vegetation and collected grasshoppers
        inside of abandoned bomas, 50\u00a0m from abandoned bomas and 250\u00a0m from
        abandoned bomas. Bomas had significantly lower grass abundance than background
        vegetation. Total grasshopper abundance was positively correlated with grass
        and forb abundance, while the proportion of grasshoppers in the subfamily
        Oedipodinae was negatively correlated with grass abundance. Grasshopper abundance
        was significantly lower inside of bomas than outside of them, but the proportion
        of grasshoppers in the subfamily Oedipodinae was significantly higher inside
        of bomas than outside of them. This suggests that the decreased vegetation
        in abandoned bomas supports fewer grasshoppers, but a higher fraction of the
        grasshopper assemblage in abandoned bomas is composed of Oedipodinae. Thus,
        traditional pastoralists can have long-term effects on the size and composition
        of grasshopper assemblages through the use of bomas. \n \nResume \n \nEn Afrique
        de l''Est, les eleveurs traditionnels augmentent l''heterogeneite des paysages
        en creant des enclos traditionnels (bomas) pour leur betail. Lorsque ces bomas
        sont abandonnes, ils restent longtemps des lieux speciaux, plus riches en
        nutriments, ou la vegetation est unique. Pourtant les effets des bomas sur
        les populations d''insectes ne sont pas clairs. L''on estime que les assemblages
        de sauterelles (du sous-ordre des Caelifera) refletent la vegetation et, parmi
        eux, la sous-famille des Oedipodinae est connue comme etant liee aux endroits
        degrades. Nous avons collecte des echantillons de vegetation et de sauterelles
        a l''interieur de bomas abandonnes, a 50\u00a0m de la et a 250\u00a0m. Les
        bomas presentaient des graminees en abondance de significativement plus faible
        que la vegetation environnante. L''abondance totale des sauterelles etait
        positivement liee a celle des graminees et des dicotyledones, mais la proportion
        de sauterelles de la sous-famille des Oedipodinae etait liee negativement
        a celle des graminees. L''abondance des sauterelles etait significativement
        plus faible a l''interieur des anciens bomas qu''a l''exterieur, mais la proportion
        de sauterelles de la sous-famille des Oedipodinae y etait significativement
        plus elevee qu''a l''exterieur. Ceci suggere que la vegetation rarefiee des
        bomas abandonnes supporte un nombre plus faible de sauterelles mais qu''une
        plus grande fraction de l''assemblage de sauterelles dans les bomas abandonnes
        se compose d''Oedipodinae. Les eleveurs traditionnels ont donc un effet a
        long terme sur la taille et la composition des assemblages de sauterelles

        hardly anything is known about the role of different connections in observation
        and learning. To address the relationships between social connections, observation
        and learning, we investigated transmission of information in two raven (Corvus

        networks on affiliative interactions, aggressive interactions and proximity.
        We then seeded novel information by training one group member on a novel task
        and allowing others to observe. In each group, an observation network based
        on who observed whose task-solving behaviour was strongly correlated with
        networks based on affiliative interactions and proximity. Ravens with high
        social centrality (strength, eigenvector, information centrality) in the affiliative
        interaction network were also central in the observation network, possibly
        as a result of solving the task sooner. Network-based diffusion analysis revealed
        that the order that ravens first solved the task was best predicted by connections
        in the affiliative interaction network in a group of subadult ravens, and
        by social rank and kinship (which influenced affiliative interactions) in

        can indirectly affect ecosystem processes via the disruption of mutualisms.
        The mutualism between the whistling thorn acacia (Acacia drepanolobium) and
        four species of symbiotic ants is an ecologically important one; ants strongly
        defend trees against elephants, which can otherwise have dramatic impacts
        on tree cover. In Laikipia, Kenya, the invasive big-headed ant (Pheidole megacephala)
        has established itself at numerous locations within the last 10-15 years.
        In invaded areas on five properties, we found that three species of symbiotic
        Crematogaster ants were virtually extirpated, whereas Tetraponera penzigi
        co-occurred with P. megacephala. T. penzigi appears to persist because of
        its nonaggressive behavior; in a whole-tree translocation experiment, Crematogaster
        defended host trees against P. megacephala, but were extirpated from trees
        within hours. In contrast, T. penzigi retreated into domatia and withstood
        invading ants for >30 days. In the field, the loss of defensive Crematogaster
        ants in invaded areas led to a five- to sevenfold increase in the number of
        trees catastrophically damaged by elephants compared to uninvaded areas. In
        savannas, tree cover drives many ecosystem processes and provides essential
        forage for many large mammal species; thus, the invasion of big-headed ants

        "title": "Juvenile social relationships reflect adult patterns of behavior
        in wild geladas", "abstract": "Unlike many mammals, primates spend much of
        their lives as reproductively\u2010immature juveniles. During the juvenile
        period, they develop social relationships and physical skills that both facilitate
        survival to adulthood and impact adult fitness. In this study, we use 2 years
        of observational data to examine the development of these skills across the
        juvenile period in a wild cercopithecine primate, the gelada (Theropithecus
        gelada). As adults, male and female geladas require different skills to be
        successful; we therefore expected sex differences in social behavior and partner
        choice during the juvenile period to already reflect these sex\u2010specific
        trajectories. For example, males, who disperse at puberty and ultimately must
        challenge other adult males for access to mates, should invest in high\u2010energy
        play\u2010fighting with other males to develop fighting and rival assessment
        skills. In contrast, philopatric females, who remain with their close kin
        throughout their lives, should invest more in forming less\u2010physical and
        more\u2010social bonds with other females within their group. As predicted,
        sex differences that foreshadowed sex\u2010specific adult roles were apparent
        in play rates, the average number of play partners per individual, grooming
        partner types and social partner preferences. Males played more and had more
        play partners than same\u2010age females. Males also groomed more often with
        individuals from outside their natal group than females, although no sex difference
        was observed in either grooming rates or number of grooming partners per individual.
        Females stopped playing earlier than males, and instead invested in grooming
        relationships with close relatives. Additionally, we found that individual
        play and grooming rates were temporally consistent for both males and females
        (i.e., from one year to the next year), suggesting that individuals exhibit
        stable behavioral phenotypes. We conclude by discussing how early life in
        geladas may shape adult behavior and reproductive strategies. Am. J. Primatol.

        "title": "DNA metabarcoding illuminates dietary niche partitioning by African
        large herbivores", "abstract": "Significance Theory holds that sympatric large
        mammalian herbivores (LMH) must partition food resources to coexist, and traditional
        frameworks categorize LMH along a spectrum from grass-eating grazers to non\u2013grass-eating
        browsers. Yet it has never been clear how finely LMH partition the enormous
        species diversity subsumed within these two broad plant types. By sequencing
        plant DNA from LMH fecal samples, we analyzed the diets of an LMH assemblage
        in Kenya. Diet composition was similar within species and strongly divergent
        across species, irrespective of feeding guild: Grazers ate similar total amounts
        of grass but different suites of grass species. These results suggest that
        species-specific plant traits may be key to understanding the dietary differences
        thought to underpin LMH diversity. Niche partitioning facilitates species
        coexistence in a world of limited resources, thereby enriching biodiversity.
        For decades, biologists have sought to understand how diverse assemblages
        of large mammalian herbivores (LMH) partition food resources. Several complementary
        mechanisms have been identified, including differential consumption of grasses
        versus nongrasses and spatiotemporal stratification in use of different parts
        of the same plant. However, the extent to which LMH partition food-plant species
        is largely unknown because comprehensive species-level identification is prohibitively
        difficult with traditional methods. We used DNA metabarcoding to quantify
        diet breadth, composition, and overlap for seven abundant LMH species (six
        wild, one domestic) in semiarid African savanna. These species ranged from
        almost-exclusive grazers to almost-exclusive browsers: Grass consumption inferred
        from mean sequence relative read abundance (RRA) ranged from >99% (plains
        zebra) to <1% (dik-dik). Grass RRA was highly correlated with isotopic estimates
        of % grass consumption, indicating that RRA conveys reliable quantitative
        information about consumption. Dietary overlap was greatest between species
        that were similar in body size and proportional grass consumption. Nonetheless,
        diet composition differed between all species\u2014even pairs of grazers matched
        in size, digestive physiology, and location\u2014and dietary similarity was
        sometimes greater across grazing and browsing guilds than within them. Such
        taxonomically fine-grained diet partitioning suggests that coarse trophic
        categorizations may generate misleading conclusions about competition and
        coexistence in LMH assemblages, and that LMH diversity may be more tightly
        linked to plant diversity than is currently recognized.", "venue": "Proceedings

        "title": "How the zebra got its stripes: a problem with too many solutions",
        "abstract": "The adaptive significance of zebra stripes has thus far eluded
        understanding. Many explanations have been suggested, including social cohesion,
        thermoregulation, predation evasion and avoidance of biting flies. Identifying
        the associations between phenotypic and environmental factors is essential
        for testing these hypotheses and substantiating existing experimental evidence.
        Plains zebra striping pattern varies regionally, from heavy black and white
        striping over the entire body in some areas to reduced stripe coverage with
        thinner and lighter stripes in others. We examined how well 29 environmental
        variables predict the variation in stripe characteristics of plains zebra
        across their range in Africa. In contrast to recent findings, we found no
        evidence that striping may have evolved to escape predators or avoid biting
        flies. Instead, we found that temperature successfully predicts a substantial
        amount of the stripe pattern variation observed in plains zebra. As this association
        between striping and temperature may be indicative of multiple biological
        processes, we suggest that the selective agents driving zebra striping are
        probably multifarious and complex.", "venue": "Royal Society Open Science",

        of sex differences and kinship in structuring a two-tiered zebra society.
        We found a significantly positive relationship between the strength of behavioural
        association and relatedness. Female relatedness within herds was higher than
        chance, suggesting that female kin drive herd formation, and consistent with
        evidence that lactating females preferentially group into herds to dilute
        predation risk. In contrast, male relatedness across harems in a herd was
        no different from relatedness across herds, suggesting that although stallions
        benefit from associating to fend off bachelors, they do not preferentially
        form kin coalitions. Although both sexes disperse, we found that most harems
        contained adult relatives, implying limited female dispersal distances and

        We investigate the effects of sociality on juvenile survival in feral horses

        (number of interactions) to assess sociality\u2019s importance to foal survival
        of a catastrophic event, the gathering and removal of 40% of the horse population.
        We found that 1) foal degree was a better predictor of foal survival than
        was foal weight; 2) following the gather, foals with access to at least one
        parent and some members of their natal groups were more likely to survive
        than were foals left with no such access; 3) foals with a higher degree both
        pre- and postgather were more likely to survive; 4) the influence of pregather
        degree appeared to be more pronounced among foals without access to parent(s)

        important to the survival of all foals, regardless of parental and natal group

        water is essential for all animals, but doing so is most challenging for desert-living
        animals. Recently Przewalski\u2019s horse has been reintroduced to the desert
        area in China where the last wild surviving member of the species was seen

        "title": "The launch of Environmental Research Reviews", "abstract": "In this
        issue we are excited to launch a new section entitled Environmental Research
        Reviews (ERR). These aremeant to be topical and evidence-based. The aim is
        to provide reviews of the environmental literature in key areas that are changing
        so quickly that it is hard for all but the specialists in these areas to keep
        up. Taken together, Environmental Research Letters (ERL) and ERR provide a
        unique set of venues to present both advances in our understanding of environmental
        issues, and to review, synthesize and disseminate our knowledge base about
        the changing natural world. ERR will appear initially as a section within
        ERL, but one with its own dedicated Editorial Board and Reviews Editor, utilising
        a format that provides depth and background into the topic under review, as
        well as a unique forum to synthesize and to draw evidencebased assessments
        and evaluations of keyfields. The first three such reviews appearing in this
        issue of ERL all focus on climate change through a variety of methodological
        approaches, and highlight the rich diversity of approaches possible to make
        sense of anthropogenic climate change as well as mitigation and adaptation
        strategies. Goetz and colleagues (1) use a traditional \u2018expert knowledge\u2019
        based approach for collecting key articles on the new technologies that are
        being employed to measure and monitor reductions of greenhouse gas emissions
        from degraded and deforested lands under REDD+. As experts, the authors assembled
        a collection of key articles that they and their colleagues knew best and
        concurred were of exceptional quality. By using key words they expanded their
        collection of articles by searching the Google Scholar and Web of Science
        databases. By emphasizing synthetic papers and those that provide information
        on uncertainty and error, the authors\u2019 comprehensive, systematic and
        step by step review concludes that current technologies are capable of providing
        measurable and verifiable levels of forest cover and biomass density in relation
        to baselines, but not yet with respect to biodiversity. Giupponi and Biscaro
        (2) take a different approach to reviewing how the concept of \u2018vulnerability\u2019
        in the climate change literature has changed as the field has matured. They
        too used a variety of key words to search the Web of Science for articles
        on climate change adaptation and disaster risk, but their focus was more on
        the dynamics of the scientific enterprise then the science itself. In order
        to study the dynamics of vulnerability to climate change, they analyzed the
        literature in terms of its bibliographic history. In doing so they show that
        two communities developed at the outset with distinct research foci and agendas.
        By using social network analysis, however, they delved into the historical
        dynamics of these communities and uncovered the fact that authors in each
        area were connected to authors in the other areas. This awareness and the
        fact that United Nations documents, which initially helped define area-separating
        vocabularies, have recently begun reconciling differences in vocabulary. As
        Giupponi\u2019s and Biscaro\u2019s bibliographic analysis strikingly shows,
        this deliberate attempt at harmonizing language is having a dramatic impact
        on closing the knowledge gap between those communities. In the third review,
        Bunch and Ford (3) explore the extent to which issues of adaptation, resilience
        and vulnerability to climate change are connected to gender in non-tokenistic
        ways. As in the previous study, the search for gender-focused articles relied
        on searching digital databases, in this case the Web of Science and Scopus.
        Over 1000 articles were identified, but in the end only 123 met the criteria
        of having a \u2018substantive\u2019 focus on gender. Bunch and Ford developed
        a conceptual model that ranked the importance of climate change on different
        genders and the different gender impacts on adaptation and vulnerability.
        Their review highlights both the differential impacts of climate change on
        gender and also how much variation exists among geographic areas, with the
        highest levels being seen in research in Sub-Saharan Africa, and type of study.
        They also show that these increasing trends are stronger for adaptation as
        opposed to vulnerability research and that gendered studies tend to focus
        more onwomen thanmen. While each review focuses on a different aspect of the
        process and outcome of climate change OPEN ACCESS", "venue": "", "year": 2015,

        in lemurs", "abstract": "Individual recognition can be facilitated by creating
        representations of familiar individuals, whereby information from signals
        in multiple sensory modalities become linked. Many vertebrate species use
        auditory\u2013visual matching to recognize familiar conspecifics and heterospecifics,
        but we currently do not know whether representations of familiar individuals
        incorporate information from other modalities. Ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta)
        are highly visual, but also communicate via scents and vocalizations. To investigate
        the role of olfactory signals in multisensory recognition, we tested whether
        lemurs can recognize familiar individuals through matching scents and vocalizations.
        We presented lemurs with female scents that were paired with the contact call
        either of the female whose scent was presented or of another familiar female
        from the same social group. When the scent and the vocalization came from
        the same individual versus from different individuals, females showed greater
        interest in the scents, and males showed greater interest in both the scents
        and the vocalizations, suggesting that lemurs can recognize familiar females
        via olfactory\u2013auditory matching. Because identity signals in lemur scents
        and vocalizations are produced by different effectors and often encountered
        at different times (uncoupled in space and time), this matching suggests lemurs
        form multisensory representations through a newly recognized sensory integration

        following birth is a period of high predation risk for ungulate neonates.
        Ungulate mothers exhibit perinatal behaviors that appear to mitigate offspring
        risk during this time. However, few studies of infant mortality include the
        postpartum period. Therefore, the function and effectiveness of these maternal
        behaviors are untested. We observed perinatal behavior in 11 Thomson\u2019s
        gazelle (Eudorcas thomsoni) mother\u2013infant pairs in a free-ranging population
        under predation pressure. Five of the six fawns that were detected by predators
        during the perinatal period were killed. Fawn survival therefore depended
        on avoiding detection by predators. Considered individually, neither prepartum
        isolation from conspecifics nor birth site selection affected the risk of
        being detected by a predator. However, analyses revealed two distinct perinatal
        tactics: mothers either isolated and gave birth in tall grass or remained
        in their social groups and gave birth in short grass. Both of these tactics
        resulted in lower risk of predator detection compared to behavior that was
        inconsistent with either tactic. The tactics represent a maternal trade-off

        of coherence and economic gains is an essential target in Dairy industry.
        This can be achieved by increasing economic returns without increasing the
        size of the herd. Animal selection is the main method for improvement of livestock
        production around the world. The determination of candidate genes for economic
        traits holds a promising future as molecular markers for improving productivity
        in farm animals. Polymorphism in the beta-lactoglobulin gene has been successfully
        studied in many goat populations of the world. However, this has not been
        clarified yet in the local Kenyan goat breeds.\u00a0 The objectives of this
        study were to screen beta-lactoglobulin gene variants and to identify its
        polymorphism in Small east African goat breed using Polymorphic Chain Reaction
        and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and sequencing techniques. A
        total of 60 goats were genotyped, 30 from each region (Samburu and Narok Counties).
        Genomic DNA was then isolated using Qiagen QiAmp blood mini kit. The amplified
        product was observed as 426 bp of exon 7 and the restriction digestion with
        SacII revealed two alleles, namely A and B and three genotypes, (AA, AB and
        BB) at the \u03b2-lactoglobulin gene locus. Allelic frequencies for goats
        found in Samburu and Narok were 0.233 and 0.133 respectively for A allele;
        0.767 and 0.867 for B allele respectively , while genotypic frequencies were
        0.1 and 0.0 for AA, 0.267 and 0.267 for AB, and 0.633 and 0.733 for BB respectively.
        In the pooled data for the small east African goat breed, the allelic frequencies
        were 0.183 and 0.817 for the A and B allele respectively, while genotypic
        frequencies were 0.05, 0.267 and 0.683 for the AA, AB and BB respectively.
        No deviations from the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium were observed.\u00a0 After
        PCR, a 426 base pairs sequence in exon 7 of 60 goat samples were sequenced
        and variation analyzed. Two point mutations corresponding to base substitutions
        were identified. The substitutions of G to A were found at both positions
        6705 and 6751 as compared to the Capra hircus sequence (Accession number Z33881.1).
        Further studies on other beta-lactoglobulin gene regions as well as other
        milk protein genes are necessary to establish associations of all its variations
        and the effects of the variants in the indigenous goat breeds.", "venue":

        Trade-off between Speed, Effort per-Unit-Time and Accuracy", "abstract": "The
        standard view in biology is that all animals, from bumblebees to human beings,
        face a trade-off between speed and accuracy as they search for resources and
        mates, and attempt to avoid predators. For example, the more time a forager
        spends out of cover gathering information about potential food sources the
        more likely it is to make accurate decisions about which sources are most
        rewarding. However, when the cost of time spent out of cover rises (e.g. in
        the presence of a predator) the optimal strategy is for the forager to spend
        less time gathering information and to accept a corresponding decline in the
        accuracy of its decisions. We suggest that this familiar picture is missing
        a crucial dimension: the amount of effort an animal expends on gathering information
        in each unit of time. This is important because an animal that can respond
        to changing time costs by modulating its level of effort per-unit-time does
        not have to accept the same decrease in accuracy that an animal limited to
        a simple speed-accuracy trade-off must bear in the same situation. Instead,
        it can direct additional effort towards (i) reducing the frequency of perceptual
        errors in the samples it gathers or (ii) increasing the number of samples
        it gathers per-unit-time. Both of these have the effect of allowing it to
        gather more accurate information within a given period of time. We use a modified
        version of a canonical model of decision-making (the sequential probability
        ratio test) to show that this ability to substitute effort for time confers
        a fitness advantage in the face of changing time costs. We predict that the
        ability to modulate effort levels will therefore be widespread in nature,
        and we lay out testable predictions that could be used to detect adaptive
        modulation of effort levels in laboratory and field studies. Our understanding
        of decision-making in all species, including our own, will be improved by
        this more ecologically-complete picture of the three-way tradeoff between
        time, effort per-unit-time and accuracy.", "venue": "PLoS Comput. Biol.",

        Use Is Not Mediated by Prey Abundance", "abstract": "The ongoing global decline
        in vulture populations raises major conservation concerns, but little is known
        about the factors that mediate scavenger habitat use, in particular the importance
        of abundance of live prey versus prey mortality. We test this using data from
        the Serengeti-Mara ecosystem in East Africa. The two hypotheses that prey
        abundance or prey mortality are the main drivers of vulture habitat use provide
        alternative predictions. If vultures select areas based only on prey abundance,
        we expect tracked vultures to remain close to herds of migratory wildebeest
        regardless of season. However, if vultures select areas where mortality rates
        are greatest then we expect vultures to select the driest regions, where animals
        are more likely to die of starvation, and to be attracted to migratory wildebeest
        only during the dry season when wildebeest mortality is greatest. We used
        data from GSM-GPS transmitters to assess the relationship between three vulture
        species and migratory wildebeest in the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem. Results
        indicate that vultures preferentially cluster around migratory herds only
        during the dry season, when herds experience their highest mortality. Additionally
        during the wet season, Ruppell\u2019s and Lappet-faced vultures select relatively
        dry areas, based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, whereas White-backed
        vultures preferred wetter areas during the wet season. Differences in habitat
        use among species may mediate coexistence in this scavenger guild. In general,
        our results suggest that prey abundance is not the primary driver of avian
        scavenger habitat use. The apparent reliance of vultures on non-migratory
        ungulates during the wet season has important conservation implications for
        vultures in light of on-going declines in non-migratory ungulate species and
        use of poisons in unprotected areas.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2014,

        "Significance Marking animals avoid locations recently visited by others.
        We conceptualized this time nonlocal avoidance behavior as stigmergy, a form
        of mediated interaction that gives rise to coordinated behavior from seemingly
        independent individuals. In so doing, the concept of stigmergy is used beyond
        the realm of eusocial insects. To link the population spatiotemporal patterns
        that emerge from the individual nonlocal rules of interaction, we construct
        a collective movement model whereby randomly moving animals have the tendency
        to avoid marks left by a conspecific, depending on the age of the mark. As
        a result, we are able to quantify animal decision-making processes in terms
        of current and past locations of other individuals, linking behavior to history-dependent
        actions. Collective animal behavior studies have led the way in developing
        models that account for a large number of individuals, but mostly have considered
        situations in which alignment and attraction play a key role, such as in schooling
        and flocking. By quantifying how animals react to one another\u2019s presence,
        when interaction is via conspecific avoidance rather than alignment or attraction,
        we present a mechanistic insight that enables us to link individual behavior
        and space use patterns. As animals respond to both current and past positions
        of their neighbors, the assumption that the relative location of individuals
        is statistically and history independent is not tenable, underscoring the
        limitations of traditional space use studies. We move beyond that assumption
        by constructing a framework to analyze spatial segregation of mobile animals
        when neighbor proximity may elicit a retreat, and by linking conspecific encounter
        rate to history-dependent avoidance behavior. Our approach rests on the knowledge
        that animals communicate by modifying the environment in which they live,
        providing a method to analyze social cohesion as stigmergy, a form of mediated
        animal\u2013animal interaction. By considering a population of animals that
        mark the terrain as they move, we predict how the spatiotemporal patterns
        that emerge depend on the degree of stigmergy of the interaction processes.
        We find in particular that nonlocal decision rules may generate a nonmonotonic
        dependence of the animal encounter rate as a function of the tendency to retreat
        from locations recently visited by other conspecifics, which has fundamental
        implications for epidemic disease spread and animal sociality.", "venue":

        that promotes the evolution of cooperation", "abstract": "Although cooperation
        and trust are essential features for the development of prosperous populations,
        they also put cooperating individuals at risk for exploitation and abuse.
        Empirical and theoretical evidence suggests that the solution to the problem
        resides in the practice of mimicry and imitation, the expectation of opponent\u2019s
        mimicry and the reliance on similarity indices. Here we fuse the principles
        of enacted and expected mimicry and condition their application on two similarity
        indices to produce a model of mimicry and relative similarity. Testing the
        model in computer simulations of behavioral niches, populated with agents
        that enact various strategies and learning algorithms, shows how mimicry and
        relative similarity outperforms all the opponent strategies it was tested
        against, pushes noncooperative opponents toward extinction, and promotes the
        development of cooperative populations. The proposed model sheds light on
        the evolution of cooperation and provides a blueprint for intentional induction
        of cooperation within and among populations. It is suggested that reducing
        conflict intensities among human populations necessitates (i) instigation
        of social initiatives that increase the perception of similarity among opponents
        and (ii) efficient lowering of the similarity threshold of the interaction,

        applied to Grevy''s and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
        describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
        \u201chotspots\u201d. The first tests each new query image sequentially against
        each database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation,
        and ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
        recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
        neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the
        Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
        recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
        producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query

        for Land Use Planning in Kenya?", "abstract": "The unique wildlife of the
        Ewaso Nyiro and valuable services that the ecosystem provides for humans (e.g.,
        clean water and productive grasslands) cannot be conserved by working solely
        on traditional conservation strongholds such as the national reserves and
        private ranches of central Laikipia. To reach objectives for conserving wildlife,
        stakeholders must work to preserve wildlife habitat and corridors in the surrounding
        human-dominated landscape\u2014a daunting task considering the complexity
        of working at large spatial scales (e.g., many landowners, competing land
        uses) and limited conservation resources available. Systematic, landscape-scale
        conservation planning helps stakeholders set meaningful and transparent objectives,
        identify where to work to meet those objectives, and prioritize areas for
        immediate investment. We describe results and implications of an initial landscape-scale
        planning exercise for the Ewaso Nyiro that culminated in a workshop in January
        2006. Forty participants selected nine focal features, set quantitative objectives
        for four of them (elephants, Grevy\u2019s zebra, lions, wild dogs), and set
        spatial conservation priorities for the entire landscape on the basis of complementary
        needs of critical species. The modest objectives for these species (e.g.,
        maintaining a population of 300 wild dogs) cannot be met by conservation focused
        solely on traditional strongholds. The exercise indicated that nearly 84%
        of the landscape needs conservation investment, and it identified three near-term
        priorities: (1) maintain current investments in conservation strongholds,
        (2) increase investment to secure the narrow corridor between Samburu and
        Laikipia Districts, and (3) increase investment to secure portions of Samburu
        District, including the Matthews Range. The results we describe represent
        the initiation of a land use planning process that, if continued, can help
        meet both biodiversity and livelihood development objectives. We recommend
        this process be carried forward in the Ewaso Nyiro and then in similar ecosystems
        in Kenya and eastern Africa. Karl A. Didier, Global Conservation Programs,

        "Background: Equids, especially zebras and donkeys, and cattle (bovids) share
        habitats in many savanna ecosystems in Africa. The issue of competition for
        food between these ungulate guilds remains largely unresolved. Resolving it
        will provide insights into how wild zebra are likely to interact with cattle
        on shared landscapes and suggest best practices for cattle owners who must
        decide whether to tolerate wild ungulates, some of which are severely threatened
        (e.g. Grevy\u2019s zebra, Equus grevyi). Aim: Determine whether an equid and
        a bovid compete in a semi-arid savanna in Kenya. Organisms: Boran cattle (Bos
        indicus) and donkeys (Equus africanus asinus) \u2013 the latter as surrogates
        for zebras. Methodology: Experiments to measure performance (weight gains),
        bite rates, diet quality (digestible organic matter and crude protein), and
        gastrointestinal worm burdens (parasite egg count per unit weight of faeces)
        of the two ungulate species when herded separately (single species) or together
        (mixed species). We used two stocking levels: low-density (one animal per
        7 ha), a level typical of commercial ranchers; and high-density (one animal
        per 2 ha), a level typical of pastoral herders. Principal findings: When herded
        together, both species gained more weight, had higher bite rates (especially
        at low stocking density), and selected diets with a more favourable balance
        between digestible organic matter and crude protein, than when herded separately.
        In addition, parasite egg output in faeces of donkeys was reduced by 14\u201335%
        following shared foraging with cattle. Conclusion: Cattle (a ruminant) and
        donkeys (hindgut fermenters, closely related to zebras) showed no evidence
        of competion with each other. Rather, our results show a facilitative, rather
        than a competitive, interaction between them.", "venue": "", "year": 2011,

        "title": "Aggression, grooming and group\u2010level cooperation in white\u2010faced
        capuchins (Cebus capucinus): insights from social networks", "abstract": "The
        form of animal social systems depends on the nature of agonistic and affiliative
        interactions. Social network theory provides tools for characterizing social
        structure that go beyond simple dyadic interactions and consider the group
        as a whole. We show three groups of capuchin monkeys from Barro Colorado Island,
        Panama, where there are strong connections between key aspects of aggression,
        grooming, and proximity networks, and, at least among females, those who incur
        risk to defend their group have particular \u201csocial personalities.\u201d
        Although there is no significant correlation for any of the network measures
        between giving and receiving aggression, suggesting that dominance relationships
        do not follow a simple hierarchy, strong correlations emerge for many measures
        between the aggression and grooming networks. At the local, but not global,
        scale, receiving aggression and giving grooming are strongly linked in all
        groups. Proximity shows no correlation with aggression at either the local
        or the global scale, suggesting that individuals neither seek out nor avoid
        aggressors. Yet, grooming has a global but not local connection to proximity.
        Extensive groomers who tend to direct their efforts at other extensive groomers
        also spend time in close proximity to many other individuals. These results
        indicate the important role that prosociality plays in shaping female social
        relationships. We also show that females who receive the least aggression,
        and thus pay low costs for group living, are most likely to participate in
        group defense. No consistent \u201csocial personality\u201d traits characterize
        the males who invest in group defense. Am. J. Primatol. 73:821\u2013833, 2011.

        "title": "Immunocontraception in Wild Horses (Equus caballus) Extends Reproductive
        Cycling Beyond the Normal Breeding Season", "abstract": "Background Although
        the physiological effects of immunocontraceptive treatment with porcine zona
        pellucida (PZP) have been well studied, little is known about PZP''s effects
        on the scheduling of reproductive cycling. Recent behavioral research has
        suggested that recipients of PZP extend the receptive breeding period into
        what is normally the non-breeding season. Methodology/Principal Findings To
        determine if this is the case, we compiled foaling data from wild horses (Equus
        caballus) living on Shackleford Banks, North Carolina for 4 years pre- and
        8 years post-contraception management with PZP (pre-contraception, n\u200a=\u200a65
        births from 45 mares; post-contraception, n\u200a=\u200a97 births from 46
        mares). Gestation lasts approximately 11\u201312 months in wild horses, placing
        conception at approximately 11.5 months prior to birth. Since the contraception
        program began in January 2000, foaling has occurred over a significantly broader
        range than it had before the contraception program. Foaling in PZP recipients
        (n\u200a=\u200a45 births from 27 mares) has consistently occurred over a broader
        range than has foaling in non-recipients (n\u200a=\u200a52 births from 19
        mares). In addition, current recipients of PZP foaled later in the year than
        did prior recipient and non-recipient mares. Females receiving more consecutive
        PZP applications gave birth later in the season than did females receiving
        fewer applications. Finally, the efficacy of PZP declined with increasing
        consecutive applications before reaching 100% after five consecutive applications.
        Conclusions/Significance For a gregarious species such as the horse, the extension
        of reproductive cycling into the fall months has important social consequences,
        including decreased group stability and the extension of male reproductive
        behavior. In addition, reproductive cycling into the fall months could have
        long-term effects on foal survivorship. Managers should consider these factors
        before enacting immunocontraceptive programs in new populations. We suggest
        minor alterations to management strategies to help alleviate such unintended
        effects in new populations.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2010, "referenceCount":

        Time in Fish: The Influence of Species Vulnerability to Predation", "abstract":
        "The shoal-choice behaviour of two species of fish that differ in their vulnerability
        to predation was compared. Individuals of threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus
        aculatus, and creek chub, Semotilus astromaculatus, were presented with a
        simultaneous choice of two equidistant stimulus shoals of conspecifics that
        differed in membership size (5 vs. 6 fish, 5 vs. 7, 5 vs. 8, 5 vs. 9 and 5
        vs. 10). Test fish were allowed to view the stimulus shoals from a standard
        distance for either 10-20 or 120-150 s before being frightened with a stimulus
        from an overhead light and released to join either shoal. We observed which
        shoal (the smaller or the larger one) the test fish approached. Preference
        for the larger stimulus shoal generally increased with increasing shoal size
        difference and with the duration of the assessment period, and was more pronounced
        in chub (the more vulnerable of the two species). For the short assessment
        period, chub showed a significantly stronger preference for the larger stimulus
        shoal than sticklebacks, whereas there was no significant difference between
        species for the long assessment period. Furthermore, chub responded more readily
        to small differences in shoal size (of 1-3 fish) than sticklebacks, for both
        short and long assessment periods. The above results are consistent with the
        hypothesis that chub, as the more vulnerable of the two species (in terms
        of predation), should be able to identify the larger of two shoals more quickly
        and should be more sensitive to small differences in shoal size than sticklebacks.",

        FINCHES IN COSTA RICA", "abstract": "Summary \n \nThe feeding ecology of three
        Costa Rican finches occurring in mixed flocks, Tiaris olivacea, Sporophila
        aurita corvina and Sporophila torquella, was investigated by measuring both
        behavioural and ecological variables. Observations on foraging height, rate
        of hopping and pecking rate, as well as the identity, proximity and number
        of nearest neighbours were recorded. In addition the duration of all feeding
        and perching episodes were timed. Comparisons were also made between the abundances
        of food items (grass seeds) consumed and those potentially available for consumption.
        \n \n \n \nThe analysis of variance of the feeding behaviour revealed that
        the presence or absence of neighbouring birds, whether of the same or different
        species, influenced the duration of feeding bouts more significantly than
        did either differences in habitat or species-characteristic behaviour. In
        addition the dietary comparisons revealed overlap in both species and size
        of seed consumed. Such similarities suggest that these species are not partitioning
        fields in the classical sense. \n \n \n \nWe propose that the increase in
        the duration of the feeding bout associated with the presence of mixed species
        aggregations leads to increased feeding efficiency and is the result of intra-
        and inter-specific social learning. Certainly flocking is often advantageous,
        since searching in a group facilitates finding clumped resources; mixed species
        flocking, by increasing exposure to a diversity of foraging places and patterns,
        can further augment feeding efficiency.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

        during translocation and acclimation in an endangered large mammal, the Grevy''s
        zebra", "abstract": "Fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis provides
        a non\u2010invasive method for studying the physiological response of wildlife
        to a variety of stressors and is a ground\u2010breaking monitoring technique
        in wildlife management and conservation. The conservation benefits of successful
        wildlife translocation restocking efforts are significant but understandably
        stressful for the animals being captured, removed from familiar habitat, held
        in captivity in many cases and subsequently released into an unfamiliar environment.
        It is imperative that we identify non\u2010invasive methods for evaluating
        stress in translocated animals, especially in endangered species. Twenty Grevy''s
        zebra Equus grevyi were translocated to Meru National Park as part of a Kenya
        Wildlife Service re\u2010population initiative. FGMs were monitored from the
        time of capture, during captivity and post\u2010release as an indicator of
        the stress of translocation and acclimation to the new environment. FGMs from
        representative non\u2010translocated zebra were used as a further control.
        When held in pens at Meru Park 3\u20134 and 5\u20136\u2003weeks after capture,
        the zebra had higher FGMs (25.1\u00b11.2 and 23.4\u00b11.3\u2003ng\u2003g\u22121)
        than either at the time of capture (14.6\u00b12.1\u2003ng\u2003g\u22121) or
        non\u2010translocated controls (16.2\u00b11.2\u2003ng\u2003g\u22121). This
        suggests that the stress of captivity elevated FGMs. FGM concentrations returned
        to pre\u2010capture concentrations c. 11\u201318\u2003weeks after the zebra
        were released into Meru Park. The return of FGM concentrations to baseline
        suggests successful acclimation to the new environment. This study supports
        the use of FGM analysis as an assessment technique in wildlife management
        projects involving the movement of endangered large mammals with application
        for monitoring stress in a wide array of conservation projects involving translocation,

        species conservation. For the endangered Grevy\u2019s zebra (Equus grevyi),
        as with many widely ranging vertebrates, human activities may be an important
        factor affecting space use. Grevy\u2019s zebras are grazing ungulates inhabiting
        the savannahs of central-northern Kenya and Ethiopia. Past research on their
        social organization indicates that reproductive status shapes associations
        and movements. Here, we examine how habitat use varies across four reproductive
        classes: lactating and nonlactating females, bachelors and territorial males.
        We also test whether Grevy\u2019s zebra avoid locations close to active livestock
        corrals, or bomas. We find that forage quality, forage quantity and habitat
        openness of locations used by Grevy\u2019s zebra vary significantly depending
        on individual reproductive state. Lactating females and bachelors use areas
        with green, short grass and mediumdense bush more frequently than nonlactating
        females or territorial males. We hypothesize that lactating females trade
        off forage quantity and safety to access nutrients in growing grass. Across
        reproductive classes, Grevy\u2019s zebra choose locations further from active
        bomas than if they used the area randomly. Our results suggest that Grevy\u2019s
        zebra may require a range of vegetation characteristics for different reproductive
        classes. Further, they may need areas free from competition or disturbance

        their movement patterns in the times of day and habitats of greatest lion
        danger. We studied a population of approximately 600 plains zebra living in

        patch was lower if lions had also been observed on that patch during the same

        lions were more active. Zebra sightings and global positioning system radio

        "title": "Male harassment influences female movements and associations in
        Grevy''s zebra (Equus grevyi)", "abstract": "In traditional models for social
        organization, female movements and association patterns track resource distribution,
        whereas males track females. More recently, this model has been expanded to
        include feedback effects of male behavior, especially sexual harassment, on
        female decisions. In Grevy''s zebra (Equus grevyi), males defend territories
        containing resources attractive to females, who form unstable groups. Past
        research has explained female behavior based on resource distribution and
        needs alone. Lactating females have been found to have restricted movements
        and fewer male associates than nonlactating females, a pattern we find in
        our study. This pattern has previously been attributed solely to the higher
        water needs of lactation. However, in our population, both lactating and nonlactating
        females are typically close to water. We test the hypothesis that male harassment
        also influences female ranging and associations with males. This effect is
        predicted to be greater for lactating females because harassment has higher
        costs to them. We find that lactating females experience higher harassment
        rates than those of nonlactating females. Lactating females tend to move faster
        during harassment periods, whereas nonlactating individuals do not. Lactating
        females experience lower harassment rates if they spend more time with a particular
        male, whereas nonlactating females'' harassment rates do not depend on their
        allocation of time to a primary male. We suggest that females concentrate
        their time with one male in order to reduce male harassment. Even in species
        such as Grevy''s zebra without strong male--female bonds, social interactions
        may be a significant driver of female distribution. Copyright 2007, Oxford

        productivity in an African savanna", "abstract": "Despite conceptual recognition
        that indirect effects initiated by large herbivores are likely to have profound
        impacts on ecological community structure and function, the existing literature
        on indirect effects focuses largely on the role of predators. As a result,
        we know neither the frequency and extent of herbivore-initiated indirect effects
        nor the mechanisms that regulate their strength. We examined the effects of
        ungulates on taxa (plants, arthropods, and an insectivorous lizard) representing
        several trophic levels, using a series of large, long-term, ungulate-exclusion
        plots that span a landscape-scale productivity gradient in an African savanna.
        At each of six sites, lizards, trees, and the numerically dominant order of
        arthropods (Coleoptera) were more abundant in the absence of ungulates. The
        effect of ungulates on arthropods was mediated by herbaceous vegetation cover.
        The effect on lizards was simultaneously mediated by both tree density (lizard
        microhabitat) and arthropod abundance (lizard food). The magnitudes of the
        experimental effects on all response variables (trees, arthropods, and lizards)
        were negatively correlated with two distinct measures of primary productivity.
        These results demonstrate strong cascading effects of ungulates, both trophic
        and nontrophic, and support the hypothesis that productivity regulates the
        strength of these effects. Hence, the strongest indirect effects (and thus,
        the greatest risks to ecosystem integrity after large mammals are extirpated)
        are likely to occur in low-productivity habitats.", "venue": "Proceedings

        arid environments in the world. All live in fissionfusion societies, but demography
        varies and the deserts in which they live often differ in subtle ways. Characterizing
        details of social structure of wild ass populations has been a challenge and
        has made it difficult to determine causes and consequences of any differences
        that might exist. We use network theory to compare the social structures of
        two populations of Asiatic asses/onagers inhabiting the Negev desert, Israel
        and khur of the Little Rann of Kuch, India and show that populations differ
        in important structural ways that represent adaptive responses to variations

        that onagers inhabiting more variable environments then khur also live in
        larger, more cohesive groups than khur. Presumably networks with this structure
        facilitate the spread of information and foster cooperation. We also show
        that demography matters since social fragmentation increases as populations
        grow. Increases in the number of components in populations, reductions in
        the number of associates and diminished cliquishness within components, appear
        to be adaptive responses to integrating increasing numbers of individuals

        varies with phenotype. In our larger populations, non-lactating females who
        are most challenged in finding sparse feeding sites, are more selective than
        lactating females in their choice of strong associates. Presumably networks
        with this structure enhance foraging success by increasing information flow

        Change on the Dynamics of Asiatic Wild Ass", "abstract": "Abstract:\u2002
        Theory proposes that increased environmental stochasticity negatively impacts
        population viability. Thus, in addition to the directional changes predicted
        for weather parameters under global climate change (GCC), the increase in
        variance of these parameters may also have a negative effect on biodiversity.
        As a case study, we assessed the impact of interannual variance in precipitation
        on the viability of an Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus) population reintroduced
        in Makhtesh Ramon Nature Reserve, Israel. We monitored the population from
        1985 to 1999 to determine what environmental factors affect reproductive success.
        Annual precipitation during the year before conception, drought conditions
        during gestation, and population size determined reproductive success. We
        used the parameters derived from this model to assess population performance
        under various scenarios in a Leslie matrix type model with demographic and
        environmental stochasticity. Specifically, we used a change in the precipitation
        regime in our study area to formulate a GCC scenario and compared the simulated
        dynamics of the population with a no\u2010change scenario. The coefficient
        of variation in population size under the global change scenario was 30% higher
        than under the no\u2010change scenario. Minor die\u2010offs (\u226515%) following
        droughts increased extinction probability nearly 10\u2010fold. Our results
        support the idea that an increase in environmental stochasticity due to GCC

        insights from zebras with comparisons to primates", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION
        Animal societies derive from the social relationships that exist among its
        members (Hinde, 1983). Behavioural ecologists have traditionally focused on
        the core relationships defining a mating system as a means toward understanding
        the role of ecology in the evolution of sociality (e.g. Jarman, 1974; Bradbury
        & Vehrencamp, 1977). Typically, these core relationships emerge from the operation
        of both natural and sexual selection and how they differently affect the behaviour
        of females and males (Rubenstein, 1986; van Schaik, 1989). However, emphasis
        on mating systems has tended to marginalise the importance to social evolution
        of interactions and relationships that extend beyond the basic breeding unit.
        This is even true for the small subset of species with multi-level societies,
        where breeding units and other social subgroups are themselves organised into
        more complex social groups within a population. By examining how natural and
        sexual selection operate within multi-level societies, however, a more complete
        understanding of the function and evolution of sociality emerges than would
        by investigating the dynamics of mating systems alone (e.g. Dunbar, 1988).
        Although the societies of many primate species are multi-levelled, the relative
        simplicity of societies of plains zebras ( Equus burchelli ) where only two
        tiers exist \u2013 the core breeding units and the herds they often comprise
        \u2013 can provide insights into the rules that give form to multi-level societies.
        In this chapter we begin by highlighting the environmental and sociosexual
        factors that shape zebra mating systems and herd dynamics.", "venue": "",

        "title": "Dynamics of fish shoals: identifying key decision rules", "abstract":
        "Social aggregations of fish are extremely common in nature. Pitcher (1983)
        defines a social aggregation of fish as a shoal, with a highly polarized shoal
        constituting a school. The ultimate causes of fish shoaling have been extensively
        studied and are well established, with the main causes being protection from
        predators and enhanced foraging ability. The proximate mechanisms by which
        groups are maintained are less well understood. Several models exist that
        examine these decision rules. A common theme to these models is the existence
        of a region at large nearest-neighbour distances (NND), where an individual
        will move towards its nearest neighbour, and a region of repulsion at small
        NND, where the individual will move away from its nearest neighbour. Recent
        models (Gueron et al., 1996; Couzin and Krause, 2003) suggest that shoaling
        decisions may not be instantaneous, instead being hierarchical as fish assess
        the presence or absence of one or more neighbours in zones of attraction,
        repulsion and neutrality. Here a mixed shoal of creek chubs (Semotilus atromaculatus)
        and blacknose dace (Rhinichthys atratulus) was examined in the field through
        video recording and digitization of images. Shoal dynamics were examined both
        under normal, undisturbed conditions, and in the presence of a simulated predator.
        By tracking the movements of individual fish over time, we find evidence for
        both attraction and repulsion zones. But three other novel features emerge
        as well. First, between regions where focal fish are attracted to, or are
        repulsed by, neighbours, there appears to be a \u2018neutral zone\u2019, where
        no consistent response occurs. Second, changes in NND at far distances, more
        so than at close distances, are affected not only by the position of nearest
        neighbours, but by the orientation of their velocity vectors as well. Third,
        the effect of increased fear level of fish induced by the appearance of simulated
        predators is a decrease in both the average NND and the sizes of the stress,
        attraction and neutral behavioural zones.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount":

        These criteria are assumed to be reasonable surrogates for the true network
        objectives. Caution is warranted, however, because the relationships between
        the selection criteria and the reserve\u2010network objectives may be inconsistent.
        Conflicts are also likely to arise because no single reserve network will
        be optimal with respect to multiple objectives (or selection criteria) simultaneously.
        Instead, reserve planners must compromise between conflicting demands. We
        field tested the relationships between a variety of selection criteria and
        the objectives of a reserve network for the sandplain natural communities
        on Martha''s Vineyard Island, Massachusetts (U.S.A.). Selection criteria that
        correlated with the reserve\u2010network objectives were used in a multi\u2010objective

        with each objective independently and those that offered optimal tradeoffs
        between the reserve\u2010network objectives. From these 10\u2010patch networks,

        and early experiences with ZebraNet", "abstract": "Over the past decade, mobile
        computing and wireless communication have become increasingly important drivers
        of many new computing applications. The field of wireless sensor networks
        particularly focuses on applications involving autonomous use of compute,
        sensing, and wireless communication devices for both scientific and commercial
        purposes. This paper examines the research decisions and design tradeoffs
        that arise when applying wireless peer-to-peer networking techniques in a
        mobile sensor network designed to support wildlife tracking for biology research.The
        ZebraNet system includes custom tracking collars (nodes) carried by animals
        under study across a large, wild area; the collars operate as a peer-to-peer
        network to deliver logged data back to researchers. The collars include global
        positioning system (GPS), Flash memory, wireless transceivers, and a small
        CPU; essentially each node is a small, wireless computing device. Since there
        is no cellular service or broadcast communication covering the region where
        animals are studied, ad hoc, peer-to-peer routing is needed. Although numerous
        ad hoc protocols exist, additional challenges arise because the researchers
        themselves are mobile and thus there is no fixed base station towards which
        to aim data. Overall, our goal is to use the least energy, storage, and other
        resources necessary to maintain a reliable system with a very high `data homing''
        success rate. We plan to deploy a 30-node ZebraNet system at the Mpala Research
        Centre in central Kenya. More broadly, we believe that the domain-centric

        behavior, such as space\u2010use patterns, are important to the success of
        animal reintroductions. We studied space\u2010use patterns in a growing population
        of Asiatic wild ass (\u2003\u2003\u2003Equus hemionus) reintroduced into the
        Ramon erosion cirque in the Negev desert, Israel. Between 1988 and 1995 we
        used direct observation to determine the location and association of males
        and females. All adult females and dominant males were individually recognized.
        Home ranges of dominant males overlapped little, suggesting that in this population
        males are territorial. After the first release of males and females into the
        wild, only one territory was established, and it covered most of the 20,000
        ha of the cirque. After 6 years the number of male territories increased as
        the number of males in the population increased, and average territory size
        decreased. Male territories were near permanent and ephemeral water sources,
        but the water sources were at the peripheries of the territories and were
        not centers of activity. When there was only one territorial male, female
        home ranges were almost entirely within the territory. As male territory size
        decreased, so did the spatial association of females with a single male. During
        the breeding season, males spent more time in close association with female
        groups, adopting what may temporarily appear to be a harem breeding strategy.
        Although demographic and environmental factors pose a greater threat to small
        populations, our data support the hypothesis that in small, reintroduced populations
        of territorial, polygynous species, effective population size (\u2003\u2003Ne\u2003\u200a)
        may be dangerously small. Our data suggest that this situation may last for
        several years until new males are recruited into the population. Thereafter,
        rapid male turnover and female use of several male territories may ameliorate
        this problem. We found no relationship between male turnover rate and female
        reproductive success. The establishment of more male territories is key to
        increasing Ne and should be the basis for planning reserves for territorial,
        polygynous species.", "venue": "Conservation Biology", "year": 2000, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Leadership in fish shoals", "abstract": "Leadership is not an inherent
        quality of animal groups that show directional locomotion. However, there
        are other factors that may be responsible for the occurrence of leadership
        in fish shoals, such as individual differences in nutritional state between
        group members. It appears that front fish have a strong influence on directional
        shoal movements and that individuals that occupy such positions are often
        characterised by larger body lengths and lower nutritional state. Potential
        interactions between the two factors and their importance for positioning
        within shoals need further attention. Initiation of directional movement in
        stationary shoals and position preferences in mobile shoals need to be addressed
        separately because they are potentially subject to different constraints.
        Individuals that initiate a swimming direction may not necessarily be capable
        of the sustained high swimming performance required to keep the front position
        or have the motivation to do so, for that matter. More empirical and theoretical
        work is necessary to look at the factors controlling positioning behaviour
        within shoals, as well as overall shoal shape and structure. Tracking of marked
        individuals whose positioning behaviour is monitored over extended time periods
        of hours or days would be useful. There is an indication that shoal positions
        are rotated by individuals according to their nutritional needs, with hungry
        fish occupying front positions only for as long as necessary to regain their
        nutritional balance. This suggests that shoal members effectively take turns
        at being leaders. There is a need for three-dimensional recordings of shoaling
        behaviour using high-speed video systems that allow a detailed analysis of
        information transfer in shoals of different size. The relationship between
        leadership and shoal size might provide an interesting field for future research.

        time and assessment quality", "abstract": "In this study, we investigated
        the role of assessment time in group size discrimination and in particular
        the trade-off between the time cost involved in gathering information and
        the potential benefits derived from the acquired information. In a first experiment,
        we presented individual chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, with a choice between
        4 vs 4 and 8 vs 8 conspecific stimulus fish. After release we recorded the
        time taken by test fish to make a choice between the two stimulus shoals in
        the presence and absence of a fright stimulus. Test fish significantly reduced
        their response time in the presence of a fright stimulus and larger shoals
        (8 vs 8) were more quickly approached than smaller ones (4 vs 4). In a control
        experiment, chub were given a choice between an empty cylinder and a shoal
        (of 4 or 8 fish). By subtracting the response time in the control treatment
        from that in the choice treatment, we estimated the time test fish spent choosing
        between stimulus shoals to be 24-55% of the overall response time. These results
        indicate that choosing between different groups is associated with a significant
        time cost. In a second experiment, we presented test fish with stimulus shoals
        that differed in size: 4 vs 5, 4 vs 6, 4 vs 7 and 4 vs 8, to investigate how
        the response time of fish and their ability to distinguish between shoals
        of different size were affected by the magnitude of the shoal size difference
        and the presence and absence of a fright stimulus. The ability to discriminate

        whereas response time decreased. Both response time and discrimination ability
        were significantly reduced in the presence of a fright stimulus. The latter
        suggests that the benefits derived from group size discrimination were increasingly
        outweighed by the time costs of making group size assessments in the presence
        of potential danger; i.e. making fast assessments became relatively more important

        of being in the front", "abstract": "We modified Hamilton''s (1971) selfish
        herd model by introducing directional movement to the prey groups and the
        predators. The consequences of this modification with regards to differential
        predation risks are compared to Hamilton''s original model (using stationary
        prey groups) and tested against empirical data. In model 1, we replicated
        Hamilton''s original predator-prey system. In models 2 and 3, prey groups
        were mobile and predators were mobile (model 2) or stationary (model 3). Our
        results indicate that additional to the positive risk gradient from centre
        to periphery predicted by Hamilton''s model for stationary groups, there might
        be another positive risk gradient from the rear to the front part in moving
        groups. Furthermore, models 2 and 3 suggest that moving groups should generally
        exhibit an elongated shape (longer than wide along the axis of locomotion)
        if risk minimisation is the only factor concerned. Also smaller inter-individual
        distances are predicted for front individuals than individuals elsewhere in
        the group. Empirical data based on the three-dimensional structure of fish
        shoals (using roach, Rutilus rutilus) were consistent with the above two predictions.
        A second experiment which involved lake chub, Semotilus atromaculatus, as
        prey and rock bass, Ambloplites rupestris, as predators, provided direct support
        for the hypothesis that individuals in front positions of groups incurred
        a significantly higher predation risk than fish in rear positions. Finally,
        we discuss the differential risks of different group positions in the context
        of potential foraging gains which provides the basis for a dynamic model of
        position preferences in group-living animals.", "venue": "", "year": 1997,

        "Abstract The dynamic behavior of small herds is investigated by means of
        simulations of two-dimensional discrete-stochastic models. An individual-based
        approach is used to relate collective behavior to individual decisions. In
        our model, the motion of an individual in a herd is assumed to be the combined
        result of both density-independent and density-dependent decisions, in the
        latter case based on the influence of surrounding neighbors; assumed decision
        rules are hierarchical, balancing short range repulsion against long-range
        attraction. The probability of fragmentation of the model herd depends on
        parameter values. We explore the variety and characteristics of spatial patterns
        that develop during migration, for herds that are homogeneous and heterogeneous
        regarding intrinsic walking speeds. Group integrity can be maintained even
        in mixed populations, but fragmentation results for these more easily than
        for a homogeneous herd. Observations of natural populations suggest that animals
        move away from individuals that intrude too closely into their environment,
        but are attracted to individuals at a distance. Between these extremes, there
        appears to be a neutral zone, within which other individuals engender no response.
        We explore the importance of this neutral zone, and offer evolutionary interpretations.
        In particular, the neutral zone, if not too large, permits the individual
        to remain in contact with the herd, while reducing the frequency with which
        acceleration or deceleration must be undertaken. This offers obvious energetic
        benefits.", "venue": "", "year": 1996, "referenceCount": 34, "citationCount":

        Herd", "abstract": "Reintroduction is the release of animals into an area
        where they were extir- pated or have significantly declined. Little is known
        about the factors that determine the success or failure of ungulate reintroduction.
        We studied the dynamics of a reintroduced Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus)
        population for 10 yr (1983-1993) following the first successful release into
        the wild. A total of 14 adult females and 14 adult males were released into
        a nature reserve in the Negev Desert of southern Israel. Over this 10-yr span
        the female population has grown to only 16 adults. Reproductive success of
        reintroduced females was low in the first 5 yr following release (0.0-0.8
        foals.female-l yr-''), but increased to 0.5- 1.0 foals-female-1''yr-'' in
        the last 5 yr. Reproductive success of wild-born females -3 yr old was higher
        than that of reintroduced females of similar ages, and ranged from 0.5-1.0
        foals female''-lyr-1. Our study and data from the E. hem.ionus studbook suggest
        that young nonprimiparous females produced primarily males, while primiparous
        and old females produced primarily females. We attribute the low reproductive
        success following reintro- duction to the stress caused by capture, transport,
        and release procedures; we consider the age-dependent progeny sex ratio within
        the framework of Trivers and Willard''s (1973) maternal allocation hypothesis.
        We conclude that the slow growth of the female population was due to: (a)
        low reproductive success of females in the early years following reintro-
        duction, and (b) a male-skewed progeny sex ratio among prime-aged reintroduced
        females. A simple stochastic Leslie matrix model suggests that high survival
        and improved repro- ductive success of reintroduced females at later stages
        of the study, and the reproductive success of wild-born females, make the
        population relatively unsusceptible to extinction from random demographic
        processes. In-depth knowledge of the dynamics of reintroduced populations
        is vital for the correct assessment of their viability. We offer suggestions
        for increasing the efficacy of future wild ass reintroductions.", "venue":

        destruction on the species that inhabit tropical areas is now receiving increased
        attention in the media. In contrast, the slow but inexorable changes in climate
        that are a by-product of rainforest de- struction have only recently entered
        the limelight. The accumulation of gases in the atmosphere due to the burning
        of fossil fuels and the re- duced photosynthetic potential of a deforested
        Earth produce climatic effects that are likely to be profound. In two papers
        that are destined to become citation classicsl,2, Robert Peters of the World
        Wildlife Fund made the logical connection be- tween the current trends towards
        a warmer climate and the fact that the present sites of many nature re- serves
        may soon no longer enjoy the meteorological conditions necessary for the well-being
        of the species they were established to support. A con- ference convened by
        the World Wildlife Fund, held in Washington in October 1988, brought together
        speakers from a variety of different disciplines to discuss the potential
        consequences for biodiversity of the currently available predictions for climate
        change. This article comple- ments two other recent reports of the conference3e4.

        "Seeking common principles of social evolution in different taxonomic groups,
        the contributors to this volume discuss eighteen groups of birds and mammals
        for which long-term field studies have been carried out. They examine how
        social organization is shaped by the interaction between proximate ecological
        pressures and culture\"--the social traditions already in place and shaped
        by local and phylogenetic history.Originally published in 1987.The Princeton
        Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available
        previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton
        University Press. These paperback editions preserve the original texts of
        these important books while presenting them in durable paperback editions.
        The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the

        water striders, Gems remigis , when competing for food and mates. Individuals
        of both sexes vie for positions in the fastest flowing portions of streams.
        Here prey capture rates are highest, as are those of swimming and aggression.
        Only the largest females, and males with the largest first appendages, can
        regularly maintain positions in these areas. The remaining females are arranged
        along the flow gradient according to their size with the smallest holding
        positions in pools of slow moving water. For the remaining males neither overall
        size, nor the size of the first appendages, appears to determine which males
        swim near the edge of streams, or which males swim as satellites behind those
        occupying the fast flowing productive areas. Preliminary data show that mating
        success of edge and satellite males are about equal, but significantly less
        than that of the centrally positioned males with the largest first appendages.
        Thus although it appears that morphological phenotype influences male competitive
        behavior, when the absolute size of the critical trait is small males adopt
        behavior after assessing the actions of others. For these \u201csubordinate\u201d

        by the fact that altruists are likely to encounter diminishing returns on
        their investments in kin. Furthermore, returns to altruism will vary because
        of phenotypic variation among recipients. Differences in fitness conversion
        efficiencies may outweigh relatedness considerations so that a distant relative
        may be more valuable than a close relative. Or else, if all kin are superefficient
        at converting investment into fitness, an even distribution of investment
        among kin may be optimal irrespective of differences in relatedness. It is
        necessary to ascertain whether the principal consequence of investment results
        in increased fecundity or increased survivorship of recipients because the
        optimal distribution of investment may differ considerably in each case.",

        "abstract": "SUMMARY (1) Populations of Everglades pygmy sunfish (Elassoma
        evergladei, family Centrachidae) were manipulated in both the laboratory and
        the field to determine how individuals responded to changes in the intensity
        of competition. (2) In laboratory experiments, individually identifiable fish
        were raised at different densities (sixteen, eight, four, and one fish per
        tank) and each individual''s competitive ability was measured by its growth
        rate and reproductive condition. For females, estimates of reproductive potential
        were ovary weight and egg number. For males, reproductive ability was estimated
        by recording the frequency of occurrence of bobbing, a sexual behaviour. In
        field experiments fish were raised at the same densities but in screened enclosures
        to evaluate the realism of the laboratory experiments. (3) Individual fish
        differed in their growth rates, and these differences were magnified under
        competitive conditions. Increased density also increased the variation among
        females within a population with respect to ovary size and egg number. (4)
        Increased population density markedly decreased the growth rate of the ''average''
        fish in the population, but only slightly the growth of the ''best'' competitors.
        In each density there were always some fish who grew as quickly as the ''average''
        fish of a population half as large. (5) Increases in population size also
        produced non-linear reductions in estimates of both male and female potential
        reproductive success. For females these reductions could be attributed in
        part to density-induced reductions in growth rate. But density also had a
        direct effect on female reproductive success: for females of similar size
        or growing at a similar rate, those raised at higher densities had larger
        ovaries and more eggs.", "venue": "", "year": 1981, "referenceCount": 23,

        \nDans la population equine de l\u2018ile de Shacklesford Banks au large de
        la cote est est USA, des changements majeurs de l''organisation sociale sont
        apparus. Au lieu de vivre classiquement en harems occupant des territoires
        se \u201cchevauchant\u201d, on s''est rendu compte que certains harems defendaient
        leur territoire et meme que certains chevaux n''appartenaient meme pas a des
        groupes fixes. L''existence de ces variations sociales semble etre due a l''habitat
        et aux caracteristiques geographiques uniques de l\u2019ile. Les territoires,
        dont les limites couraient le long de l\u2018ile, n''existaient que la ou
        celle-ci est etroite, la visibilite non obstruee et ou les principales zones
        de vegetation courent le long de l''axe principal de l\u2019ile. Ce n''est
        qu\u2018a ces endroits que les difficultes de defense etaient reduites et
        les posibilites de se nourrir et d''assurer la garde pour les m\u00e2les etaient
        superieures. Dans les zones de hautes dunes de sable et de foret epaisse,
        des assemblages provisoires ont ete observes et des harems sans territoire
        fixe occupaient les zones semi-ouvertes accidentees avec des m\u00e2les celibataires.
        \n \nUne fois les territoires defendus, de nombreux aspects des relations
        sociales individuelles changent. Les etalons a territoire ont moins tendance
        a influencer les activites quotidiennes de leurs groupes et plus a s''occuper
        de leurs femelles dominantes et a regrouper leurs femelles subordonnees que
        les etalons sans territoire. De plus, les distances individuelles sont generalement
        plus grandes entre animaux vivant dans des harems territoriaux par opposition
        a des harems non territoriaux. \n \nZusammenfassung \nBei einer Pferdepopulation
        auf Shacklesford Banks, einer Insel vor der amerikanischen Ostkuste, haben
        sich grosere soziale Organisationsveranderungen ereignet. Anstatt in den typischen
        Harems in sich uberschneidenden Heimatgebieten zu leben, wurde festgestellt,
        das einige Harems ihre Territorien verteidigten und einige Pferde noch nicht
        einmal in festen Gruppen lebten. Das Bestehen dieser sozialen Variationen
        schien mit dem einzigartigen Lebensraum und den geographischen Besonderheiten
        der Insel in Zusammenhang zu stehen. Territorien, deren Grenzen uber die ganze
        Breite der Insel verliefen, gab es nur an den Stellen, wo die Insel schmal
        und die Sicht unbegrenzt war und wo die Vegetationszonen entlang der Langsachse
        der Insel verliefen. Nur hier waren die Schwierigkeiten der Verteidigung reduziert
        und die Ernahrung sowie die Moglichkeit der mannlichen Partnerbewachung besser.
        Wo die Sanddunen hoch und die Walder dicht waren, fanden zeitweise Zusammenschlusse
        statt, und nichtterritoriale Harems bewohnten zusammen mit den weibchenlosen
        Mannchen die uneinheitliche, halboffene Landschaft. Mit dem Beginn der Territoriumsverteidigung
        veranderten sich auch zahlreiche Aspekte der individuellen sozialen Verhaltnisse.
        Territoriale Hengste neigten weniger dazu, das tagliche Aktivitatsmuster ihrer
        Gruppe zu beeinflussen, und tendierten eher dazu, ihre dominanten Weibchen
        zu versorgen und zu pflegen und ihre untergeordneten Weibchen zusammenzutreiben
        als ihre nicht-territorialen Gegenstucke. Bei territorialen Harems wurden
        auch grosere Abstande zwischen den einzelnen Tieren beobachtet als bei nichtterritorialen.
        \n \nSummary \nIn a horse population on Shackleford Banks, an island off the
        American east coast, major changes in social organisation have occurred. Instead
        of typically living in harems occupying overlapping home ranges, it was found
        that some harems defended territories and some horses did not even live in
        fixed membership groups. The existence of these social variations appeared
        to be correlated with the unique habitat and geographical features of the
        island. Territories, whose boundaries ran the width of the island, only occurred
        where the island was narrow, the visibility unrestricted and the essential
        vegetation zones ran along the island''s long axis. Only here were the difficulties
        in defending reduced and feeding and male mate-guarding opportunities increased.
        Where the sand dunes were high and forest dense temporary assemblages occurred
        and non-territorial harems occupied the patchy semi-open area with the batchelor
        males. \n \nOnce territories were defended many aspects of individual social
        relationships became altered. Territorial stallions were less likely to influence
        the daily activity patterns of their groups and more likely to groom their
        dominant females and round-up their subordinate females than were their non-territorial
        counterparts. In addition, interpersonal distances were likely to be greater
        among horses living in territorial, as opposed to nonterritorial, harems.",

        SIZE", "abstract": "Darwin (1871, p. 568) wrote \"sexual selection depends
        on the advantage which certain individuals have over others of the same sex
        and species solely in respect to reproduction.\" This selection may act in
        several ways. Two extremes are either the individuals of one sex, usually
        males (but see Trivers, 1972), compete amongst themselves, with the winners
        acquiring the most mates; or the members of one sex, usually females, discriminate
        among members of the other sex choosing to mate with the most \"attractive\"
        individuals. The first extreme of sexual selection, competition among males,
        has been documented by field studies on baboons (De Vore, 1965), dungflies
        (Parker, 1970), elephant seals (Le Boeuff, 1974), lizards (Trivers, 1972,
        1976), prairie chickens (Robel, 1966), and sage grouse (Scott, 1942). For
        example, Le Boeuff (1974) found that less than one third of the males in a
        breeding aggregation accounted for all of the matings and that copulation
        frequency was correlated with social rank. Competition among males may be
        incited in turn by the behavior of females (Cox and Le Boeuff, 1977). The
        second extreme of sexual selection, female choice among alternate mates, has
        not been studied as vigorously, and some biologists (Huxley, 1938; Lack, 1968)
        have doubted its importance to evolution. However, Trivers (1972) has theoretically
        shown the adaptive advantage that a female can gain by choosing the best of
        alternative mates and O''Donald (1972, 1973) with computer simulations has

        (4) motile-particle deposition, and (5) electrostatic attraction. For these

        characteristics of the filter, the particles, and the flow affect the intensity
        of particle capture. By comparing the magnitudes of these indexes it is possible
        to determine the main mechanism a filter is using to capture particles. Awareness

        crayfish Orconectes virilis was observed in the laboratory, with attention
        to the effects of size, past experience, and displays. Character analysis
        was utilized to quantify the relative importance of these three factors. I)
        In short fights, larger animals and animals which had won previous fights
        had a decided advantage. 2) In long fights, size and past experience seemed
        to have little influence on who would win. 3) Initiating an interaction gave
        an animal and advantage in short fights or when both were the same size. 4)
        Model presentations indicated that postures assumed during fights were effective
        visual stimuli and that the white areas on appendages are important components
        of displays. 5) The greatest reduction in uncertainty concerning which behavior
        pattern would occur at any time in a fight came from knowing the just previous
        act of the other crayfish. 6) The amount of information transmitted from one
        crayfish to another by displays increased during fights to a peak of 160 bits
        (53% uncertainty reduction) in the middle of fights. 7) Partitioning the data
        into long or short fights and into initiator-won or defender-won fights increased
        the apparent importance of inter-animal communication.", "venue": "", "year":

        "title": "An Examination of Social Participation Found among a National Sample
        of Black and White Elderly", "abstract": "Family and kin often are the primary
        source for emotional support in the later years. Older people are expected
        to attach a relatively higher value to the emotional aspects of life as other
        social functions diminish. They are expected to develop a greater orientation
        to affective, expressive, and affectional goals (Rosow, 1967). Consequently,
        the family and kinship system becomes the major social institution for the
        social participation of elderly people. At a time of life when emotional security
        is so greatly challenged (Simpson and McKinney, 1969), one\u2019s family and
        kin are expected to provide the necessary support for one\u2019s morale or
        well-being. In this article I will identify and describe the Black older person,
        and examine his social participation (in comparison with White aged) with
        family and kin. Social participation is here defined as the activity with
        other people that contributes to one\u2019s social relationships which he
        comes to depend on for emotional support and responsiveness and which maintain
        him in many subtle ways (Lehr and Rudinger, 1969). To provide a framework
        for this examination, one assumption is made and one hypothesis is posed.
        It is assumed that: There are demographic differences between Black and White
        elderly; that is, when income, marital status, education, occupation, and
        religion are examined by sex, residential location and race are expected to
        differ significantly. It is hypothesized that: Household situations are different
        for Black and White elderly. It is proposed that these differences show that
        the elderly Black are more likely to live alone or in household situations
        without spouse and that White elderly are more likely to live with a spouse
        as a couple, or in household situations with a spouse. It is further hypothesized
        that Black elderly persons living alone or without a spouse have a low state
        of morale or well-being in old age.", "venue": "", "year": 1971, "referenceCount":

        "<p>Marine fisheries are social-ecological systems important for human health
        and livelihoods. However, research approaches that consider human&#8211;nature
        interactions within as well as between adjacent and distant fisheries are
        scarce. As such, we measured and modeled marine fisheries catches at local
        and regional scales over 65 years (1950&#8211;2014), assessed cross-scalar
        interactions among fishing types (artisanal, subsistence, industrial, recreational),
        and predicted future catches using the metacoupling framework, a new approach
        for evaluating human-nature interactions within and across adjacent and distant
        fisheries (metacouplings). Across taxa examined (mahi-mahi [<em>Coryphaena
        hippurus</em>], Atlantic bluefin tuna [<em>Thunnus thynnus</em>], cods [Gadidae]),
        75% of catches (8.5 million metric tons [MMT]) were made by nations in their
        own exclusive economic zones (EEZs; Type 1 fishing). However, catches in adjacent
        EEZs (Type 2 fishing, 1.0 MMT) and distant EEZs and the high seas (Type 3
        fishing, 1.9 MMT) increased substantially for all taxa at certain times, becoming
        consistently important for tuna and cods after 1980. Moreover, Types 1&#8211;3
        fishing interacted in ways that affect humans differentially across fisheries.
        For instance, tuna artisanal and subsistence catches (Type 1) decreased with
        increasing Type 2 and Type 3 industrial fishing, respectively. Cod subsistence
        catches declined with increasing Type 2/3 industrial fishing and Type 1 artisanal
        fishing, whereas fishing-type interactions were largely positive for mahi-mahi,
        causing catches to increase across sectors. Overall, metacouplings affect
        humans in positive and negative ways that vary across scales and fisheries
        systems, galvanizing the need for metacoupling-informed fisheries research,
        policy, and management programs. We&#8217;ve since extended this research
        approach to include Atlantic herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), the subject
        of a journal article in press.</p>", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount":

        the gambling industry to act responsibly in their provision of gambling, only
        modest advances have been made to establish best practices in this area. Worldwide,
        few governments even approach what William Eadington, in Trends in gambling
        and responsible gaming in the US and elsewhere (2003, http://www.888betsoff.com/links/04
        presentations/Eadington.pdf), calls a stage-four level of responsible gambling
        stewardship, that is, the unconditional acceptance of strong measures to attenuate
        gambling-related harms. One of the cornerstones of a gambling regime oriented
        toward consumer safety and public interest is a commitment by government and
        the gambling industry to meet commendable standards for accountability and
        social responsibility. After studying the government\u2019s legislative framework
        for the operation and regulation of gambling in the province of Ontario (Canada),
        reviewing the province\u2019s gambling-related mission and public-policy statements,
        and interviewing key actors in the government\u2019s gambling administration,
        a template was developed for an optimally socially responsible and accountable
        gambling regime that operates in the public interest. The template, along
        with suggestions for improving accountability and social responsibility in
        the provision of gambling, is presented.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount":
