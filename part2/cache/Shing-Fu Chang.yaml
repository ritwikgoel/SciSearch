        (HDCEs) is a NP-hard problem. Although a number of scheduling approaches have
        been proposed for workflow scheduling in HDCEs, there is still a room and
        need for improvement. To fill the gaps, this study formulates workflow scheduling
        problem in HDCEs as a complete, solvable and extensible integer programming
        mathematical model with precedence and resource constraints that provides
        a theoretical foundation for developing workflow scheduling strategy. Then,
        this study develops a novel two-stage multi-population genetic algorithm with
        heuristics for workflow scheduling. In particular, two-stage multi-population
        coevolution strategy is employed with designed novel methods for population
        initialization, genetic operation, individual decoding and improvement. To
        estimate the validity, extensive experiments are designed and conducted on
        various scenarios based on real and random workflow applications. The results
        have shown the practical viability of the proposed algorithm outperforming
        conventional approaches.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Cloud Computing",

        "title": "Energy-Efficient Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Surveillance Utilizing
        Artificial Intelligence (AI)", "abstract": "Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles
        (UAVs) enhance connectivity and accessibility for civilian and military applications.
        A group of UAVs with on-board cameras usually monitors or collects information
        about designated areas. The UAVs can build a distributed network to share/exchange
        and to process collected sensing data before sending to a data processing
        center. A huge data transmission among them may cause latency and high-energy
        consumption. This paper deploys artificial intelligent (AI) techniques to
        process the video data streaming among the UAVs. Thus, each distributed UAV
        only needs to send a certain required information to each other. Each UAV
        processes data utilizing AI and only sends the data that matters to the others.
        The UAVs, formed as a connected network, communicate within a short communication
        range and share their own data to each other. Convolution neural network (CNN)
        technique extracts feature from images automatically that the UAVs only send
        the moving objects instead of the whole frames. This significantly reduces
        redundant information for either each UAV or the whole network and saves a
        huge energy consumption for the network. The UAVs can also save energy for
        their motion in the sensing field. In addition, a flocking control algorithm
        is deployed to lead the group of UAVs in the working fields and to avoid obstacles
        if needed. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the

        role in the supply chain will buy diverse components from different suppliers,
        warehouse and resell them to a number of electronics manufacturers with vendor-managed

        demand uncertainty. However, demand fluctuation and supply chain complexity
        are increasing due to shortening product life cycle in the consumer electronics
        era and long lead time for capacity expansion for high-tech manufacturing.
        Focusing realistic needs of a leading distributor for semiconductor components
        and modules, this study aims to construct a UNISON framework based on deep
        reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamically selecting the optimal demand forecast

        smart production for Industry 3.5. Deep RL that integrates deep learning architecture

        "title": "Empirical Study of Multi-Objective Parameter Optimization in Wire
        Bonding Process", "abstract": "Wire bonding is one of the key processes which
        connects the wafer die and the lead frame in the IC packaging process. It
        is noted that process parameters influence both the speed and quality of bonding.
        Parameters, such as descending speed and cycles affect the bonding speed;
        while parameters such as bonding force and ultrasonic energy level affect
        the strength of joint. Both situations will affect the output (unit per hour,
        UPH), and lead to the variation of the production capacity as well.Nowadays,
        most companies in Taiwan still follow the rule of thumb when setting the process
        parameters. However, the large number of parameters in the bonding process
        makes it difficult for engineers to find appropriate parameters at once efficiently
        based on their experience only. When new products are introduced into mass
        production, engineers must go through multiple adjustments in a repeated trial
        and error way to find out the appropriate parameters, which takes lots of
        time, manpower and material resources.Using data mining techniques to establish
        predictive models for process parameters can not only increase the production
        capacity but also reduce the cost of the operation during adjustments. However,
        most studies in the field of wire bonding parameter optimization focused on
        increasing the bonding quality, while little consider the operation time and
        quality simultaneously. In this study, a data mining framework is proposed
        to extract the relationship between the bonding speed, bonding quality and
        the parameters.This study aims to increase production capacity by enhancing
        the bonding quality and the bonding speed simultaneously via recommending
        optimized process parameters. The proposed framework is based on a defect
        classification model constructed by random forest (RF) and extreme gradient
        boosting (XGBoost) method, and a multi-objective process parameters optimization
        model applying particle swarm optimization (PSO) method.An empirical study
        was conducted in a leading IC packaging and assembly company in Taiwan. The
        empirical result on 2 testing products reveals that the proposed approach
        increases the bonding quality by 70%, whereas the bonding speed is enhanced
        by 20%; overall, the proposed approach benefits output UPH by 26.6%, 5.0%
        for each product. Besides improving the production capacity, the proposed
        framework can also recommend parameters systematically and more quickly to
        enhance engineers\u2019 parameter tuning efficiency on-line and achieve the
        goal of reducing the introduction time of new products.", "venue": "Impact",

        Wire Bonding Process in IC Packaging Industry and Empirical Study", "abstract":
        "In the wire bonding process, different setting value of manufacturing parameters
        affect the quality of the solder joints and the speed of wire bonding significantly.
        And when a new product is introduced, it is difficult to quickly obtain effective
        parameters simply by relying on the experience of the engineers. The study
        aims to propose a data mining framework to help the IC packaging factories
        to increase production capacity by reducing the number of downtimes and speeding
        up the wire bonding time. The proposed data mining framework employed random
        forest and XGBoost method to classify the occurrence of defect, MARS algorithm
        to predict the wire bonding time, and genetic algorithm to search for the
        manufacturing parameters. By exploring the production data, the proposed framework
        finally provides a set of recommended manufacturing parameters of the second
        bonding process. This study cooperates with a leading assembly company in
        Taiwan to validate the proposed framework. The empirical result reveals that
        it improves the packaging yield by 0.03%. The domain engineers can also find
        parameters more systematically and quickly by the proposed framework.", "venue":

        A Case of High-Mixed Wafer Fabrication", "abstract": "It is vital to have
        an exclusive modification in semiconductor production process because of meeting
        differentiated customer demands in dynamic and competitive global minuscule
        semiconductor technology market and the highly complex fabrication process.
        In this paper, we propose a control system based on the dynamic mixed-effect
        least-square support vector regression (LS-SVR) control system for overlay
        error compensation with stochastic metrology delay to minimize the misalignment
        of the patterning process. Moreover, for the stability of the control system
        in the presence of metrology delay and to deal with nonlinearity among the
        overlay factors, the novel Lyapunov-based kernel function is merged with the
        LS-SVR controller. The proposed controller\u2019s operation has been validated
        and implemented by a major semiconductor manufacturer in Taiwan. The experiments
        are verified that mixed-effect LS-SVR controller has the higher validity and
        higher efficiency in comparison with the exponentially weighted moving average
        (EWMA) and threaded EWMA controllers which had been previously implemented
        at the company or applied in similar studies. Note to Practitioners\u2014Due
        to high production complexity in semiconductor manufacturing process, a meticulous
        and intelligent process control is needed to achieve higher throughput and
        customer satisfaction. Monitoring a complex system is challenging because
        the process components and variables operate autonomously and interoperate
        with other manufacturing segments. This paper proposes a novel run-to-run
        (R2R) control system to compensate the overlay error during the photolithography
        process that efficiently deals with the high-mixed manufacturing environment
        and metrology delay.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and

        for Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Under Uncertain Processing Time for Semiconductor
        Manufacturing", "abstract": "Semiconductor manufacturing is a complicated
        flexible job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) of combinatorial complexity. Because
        of the adoption of advanced process control and advanced equipment control,
        the processing time in advanced wafer fabs become uncertain. Existing approaches
        considering constant processing time may not be appropriate to address the
        present problem in a real setting. In practice, processing times can be represented
        as intervals with the most probable completion time somewhere near the middle
        of the interval. A fuzzy number that is a generalized interval can represent
        this processing time interval exactly and naturally. This paper developed
        a hybrid approach integrating a particle swarm optimization algorithm with
        a Cauchy distribution and genetic operators (HPSO+GA) for solving an FJSP
        by finding a job sequence that minimizes the makespan with uncertain processing
        time. In particular, the proposed hybridized HPSO+GA approach employs PSO
        for creating operation sequences and assigning the time and resources for
        each operation, and then uses genetic operators to update the particles for
        improving the solution. To estimate the validity of the proposed approaches,
        experiments were conducted to compare the proposed approach with conventional
        approaches. The results show the practical viability of this approach. This

        machine is one of the most electricity-consuming parts of factory facilities

        to test the validity of the proposed approach. The proposed algorithm was
        compared with conventional approaches for both convergence and diversity.
        The results have shown the practical viability of this approach in efficiently
        and effectively generating near-optimal portfolio alternatives for portfolio
        selection. The approach also enables the scheduling of the selected projects
        to achieve R&D portfolio objectives. The developed solution was fully implemented
        and adopted by the company.", "venue": "IEEE transactions on semiconductor

        "title": "An empirical study of demand forecasting of non-volatile memory
        for smart production of semiconductor manufacturing", "abstract": "As high-speed
        computing is crucial to empower intelligent manufacturing for Industry 4.0,
        non-volatile memory (NVM) is critical semiconductor component of the cloud
        and data centre for the infrastructures. The NVM manufacturing is capital
        intensive, in which capacity utilisation significantly affects the capital
        effectiveness and profitability of semiconductor companies. Since capacity
        migration and expansion involve long lead times, demand forecasting plays
        a critical role for smart production of NVM manufacturers for revenue management.
        However, the shortening product life cycles of integrated circuits (IC), the
        fluctuations of semiconductor supply chains, and uncertainty involved in demand
        forecasting make the present problem increasingly difficult in the consumer
        electronics era. Focusing on the realistic needs of NVM demand forecasting,
        this study aims to develop a decision framework that integrates an improved
        technology diffusion model and a proposed adjustment mechanism to incorporate
        domain insights. An empirical study was conducted in a leading semiconductor
        company for validation. A comparison of alternative approaches is also provided.
        The results have shown the practical viability of the proposed approach.",

        response and filter design ideas to derive new product design directions.
        Two empirical studies were conducted with the collaboration of a world leading
        electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company. The derived results can
        support the confirmation of the target segments from the perspective of marketing
        and clarifying key factors. Based on UXDOE, this study investigated the influence
        of UX on 14 notebook prototypes and wearable product design practices. The
        results of empirical studies have shown practical viability of the proposed
        approach. This study filters design ideas of esthetics and indicate several

        intelligence has become a crucial issue for maintaining competitive advantages.
        Industry 4.0, proposed by Germany, is one of the large-scale projects to achieve
        manufacturing intelligence and smart production. Others include the Advanced
        Manufacturing Partnership 2.0 (AMP2.0) from the United States, Industry 4.1J
        of Japan and Made in China 2025. On the other hand, most of the emerging countries
        may not be ready for the migration of Industry 4.0 directly since their industrial
        infrastructures are different with the leading countries. This study aims
        to propose Industry 3.5 as a hybrid strategy between existing Industry 3.0
        and to-be Industry 4.0, in which digital decision-making, big data analytics,
        and manufacturing intelligence are integrated to empower smart production
        with disruptive innovations that can be realized in existing industrial infrastructure.
        To estimate the validity of the proposed Industry 3.5, an empirical study
        was conducted in a thin film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) manufacturing
        factory in Taiwan. A smart daily planning and scheduling (DPS) system is developed
        to enhance manufacturing intelligence for smart production without a fully
        automation facility as the Cyber-Physical System proposed in Industry 4.0.

        size of integrated circuits driven by continuous technology migrations for
        wafer fabrication, the control of tightening critical dimensions is critical
        for yield enhancement, while physical failure analysis is increasingly difficult.
        In particular, the yield ramp up stage for implementing new technology node
        involves new production processes, unstable machine configurations, big data
        with multiple co-linearity and high dimensionality that can hardly rely on
        previous experience for detecting root causes. This research aims to propose
        a novel data-driven approach for Analysing semiconductor manufacturing big
        data for low yield (namely, excursions) diagnosis to detect process root causes
        for yield enhancement. The proposed approach has shown practical viability

        in semiconductor manufacturing", "abstract": "Nowadays, there are more attentions
        on cost control and yield enhancement in the semiconductor industry. Many
        manufacturers have the ability to collect the physical data called Status
        Variables Identification (SVID) by sensors embedded in the advanced machines
        during the manufacturing process. To maintain the competitive advantages,
        process monitoring and quick response to yield problem are pivotal in detecting
        the cause of the faults with the help of the sensor data. To state the physical
        nature of certain SVID, we usually transform SVID into Fault Detection and
        Classification parameters (FDC parameters) using statistical indicators. The
        data containing FDC parameters is called FDC data. This study aims to develop
        a multivariate analysis model to find out the crucial factors which may lead
        to process excursion among a large amount of FDC data. We proposed a 2-phase
        multivariate analysis framework: (1) the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
        Operator (LASSO) is applied for key operation screening. (2) And Random Forest
        (RF) is used to rank the FDC parameters based on the key operations. Based

        for 200-mm wafer fabs, this paper aims to propose a novel approach for manual
        material handling system (MMHS) to mimic functionalities of the automated
        material handling system in the advanced fabs without intensive capital investment
        to deliver the wafer lots manually and systematically. In particular, a mathematical
        model is developed to optimize the routing plan with two objectives that minimize
        the total traveling distance in all routes or minimize the number of manpower
        needed in all routes. Furthermore, a route planning approach is proposed to
        utilize the routes that reduce the technician traveling distance and transportation
        time for implementation. Also, a manpower loading index was developed for
        evaluating the number of needed technicians in the proposed MMHS. To estimate
        the validity of the proposed MMHS, we developed a simulation environment based
        on empirical data with different transportation requirement scenarios for
        comparison. The results have shown practical viability of the proposed approach.",

        "With the feature size shrinkage in advanced technology nodes, the modeling
        of process variations has become more critical for troubleshooting and yield
        enhancement. Misalignment among equipment tools or chambers in process stages
        is a major source of process variations. Because a process flow contains hundreds
        of stages during semiconductor fabrication, tool/chamber misalignment may
        more significantly affect the variation of transistor parameters in a wafer
        acceptance test. This study proposes a big data analytic framework that simultaneously
        considers the mean difference between tools and wafer-to-wafer variation and
        identifies possible root causes for yield enhancement. An empirical study

        Interposer", "abstract": "In recent years, the 2.5D IC (Integrated Circuit)
        package with TSV (Through Silicon Vias) has become important for high-bandwidth
        and high-performance applications. It is well known that 2.5D technology requires
        significant innovation in the areas of process technology, packaging, design,
        thermals, and test solutions leading to several hundred new technologies in
        a single product. With these complex material sets and process steps combined
        with new design requirements, methods, and components, a significant amount
        of research and engineering development is required to bring a successful
        product to market. After an 8 year development, in July of 2015 AMD reported
        it began shipment of a new generation of AMD Radeon Fury graphics cards, based
        on the development of the \"Fiji\" GPU and the first generation of High Bandwidth
        Memory (HBM1). This announcement is the next major step in an era for 2.5D
        IC package technology which will be used in a wide variety of applications.
        Given the scope of this undertaking many collaborations were required. This
        paper provides an overview of the collaboration between AMD and ASE. It chronicles
        the work from initial proof of concept to technology feasibility to product
        development to production ramp and ultimately high volume production. Details
        of several functional prototypes are outlined including warpage characterization,
        stress reduction, materials selection methodologies, and the use of finite
        element analysis (FEA) and advanced Warpage Metrology Analyzer (WMA) for optimization.
        The result is a reliable 2.5D process flow with >99% assembly yield for a
        1011mm2 interposer with 5 dies attached in a 300+W 55x55mm2 package.", "venue":

        the phase angle over the local oscillator rather than over the output X-band
        signal for transmission. Alternatively, by dynamically adjusting the amplitude
        and phase of the FMCW signals generated by direct digital synthesis (DDS)

        lots are to provide marketing and engineering with extra flexibility regarding
        delivery lead times, and in turn enhance its competitive advantages against
        other companies. On the other hand, hot lots are among major sources of disruption
        of the smoothness of the manufacturing flow. They can lead to a significant
        increase of cycle time of normal lots, and in turn result in delayed delivery
        times and serious service deteriorations. Due to the complex nature of semiconductor
        manufacturing, evaluating the impact of hot lots on the cycle time of normal
        lots presents major challenges. In this paper, we propose a methodology, called
        progressive simulation metamodelling (PSM), that allows for an efficient development
        of the response surface between the cycle time of normal lots and the percentage
        of hot lots in semiconductor manufacturing. The response surface generated
        by the proposed PSM is like an easy-to-use analytical model, but with the
        fidelity of simulation that takes into account all important manufacturing
        details. The specially-designed mechanisms, including identifying the critical
        region and sequentially adding design points in the critical region, further
        grants PSM computational advantages compared to the traditional response surface

        hybrid genetic algorithm based on auto-tuning strategy", "abstract": "The
        re-entrant flow shop scheduling problem considering time windows constraint
        is one of the most important problems in hard-disc drive (HDD) manufacturing
        systems. In order to maximise the system throughput, the problem of minimising
        the makespan with zero loss is considered. In this paper, evolutionary techniques
        are proposed to solve the complex re-entrant scheduling problem with time
        windows constraint in manufacturing HDD devices with lot size. This problem
        can be formulated as a deterministic Fm\u2009|\u2009fmls, rcrc, temp\u2009|\u2009Cmax
        problem. A hybrid genetic algorithm was used for constructing chromosomes
        by checking and repairing time window constraints, and improving chromosomes
        by a left-shift heuristic as a local search algorithm. An adaptive hybrid
        genetic algorithm was eventually developed to solve this problem by using
        fuzzy logic control in order to enhance the search ability of the genetic
        algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments were carried out to demonstrate
        the efficiency of the developed approaches.", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount":

        Scheduling", "abstract": "The thin-film transistor-liquid crystal display
        (TFT-LCD) module assembly production is a flexible job-shop scheduling problem
        that is critical to satisfy the customer demands on time. On the module assembly
        shop floor, each workstation has identical and non-identical parallel machines
        that access the jobs at various processing velocities depending on the product
        families. To satisfy the various jobs, the machines need to be set up as the
        numerous tools to conduct consecutive products. This study aims to propose
        a novel approach to address the TFT-LCD module assembly scheduling problem
        by simultaneously considering the following multiple and often conflicting
        objectives such as the makespan, the weighted number of tardy jobs, and the
        total machine setup time, subject to the constraints of product families,
        non-identical parallel machines, and sequence-dependent setup times. In particular,
        we developed a multiobjective hybrid genetic algorithm (MO-HGA) that hybridizes
        with the variable neighborhood descent (VND) algorithm as a local search and
        TOPSIS evaluation technique to derive the best compromised solution. To estimate
        the validity of the proposed MO-HGA, experiments based on empirical data were
        conducted to compare the results with conventional approaches. The results
        have shown the validity of this approach. This study concludes with a discussion

        in semiconductor industry, semiconductor companies have to continuously advance
        manufacturing technology and improve productivity to maintain competitive
        advantages. Die cost is significantly influenced by wafer productivity that
        is determined by yield rate and the number of gross dies per wafer. However,
        little research has been done on design for manufacturing and productivity

        Product Appearance Design", "abstract": "\u2014 In the era of rapidly increasing
        notebook market, consumer electronics manufacturers are facing a highly dynamic
        and competitive environment. In particular, the product appearance is the
        first part for user to distinguish the product from the product of other brands.
        Notebook product should differ in its appearance to engage users and contribute
        to the user experience (UX). The UX evaluates various product concepts to
        find the design for user needs; in addition, help the designer to further
        understand the product appearance preference of different market segment.
        However, few studies have been done for exploring the relationship between
        consumer background and the reaction of product appearance. This study aims
        to propose a data mining framework to capture the user\u2019s information
        and the important relation between product appearance factors. The proposed
        framework consists of problem definition and structuring, data preparation,
        rules generation, and results evaluation and interpretation. An empirical
        study has been done in Taiwan that recruited 168 subjects from different background
        to experience the appearance performance of 11 different portable computers.
        The results assist the designers to develop product strategies based on the
        characteristics of consumers and the product concept that related to the UX,
        which help to launch the products to the right customers and increase the
        market shares. The results have shown the practical feasibility of the proposed

        Distribution for Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem", "abstract": "Flexible
        job-shop scheduling problem (FJSP) has been well known as one of the most
        difficult NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. This problem FJSP is
        an extension of job-shop scheduling problem (JSP) which is to create a sequence
        of operations satisfying the precedence relationship together with assignment
        of time and resources for each operation. Thus, the FJSP model is closer to
        the real factory situation and greater complexity than JSP model due to the
        need to determine the assignment of operations to machines. This paper proposes
        a hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm combined with genetic
        algorithm (GA) and Cauchy distribution to solve the flexible job shop scheduling
        problem. The objective is to find a job sequence that minimizes the makespan.
        The hybrid PSO combined with GA is based on the particle swarm optimization
        for creating operation sequences and assign operations on machines, and for
        improving by the genetic operators such as crossover and mutation to update
        particles. Finally, the proposed method is illustrated with a numerical example
        and numerical experiment results show that the effectiveness of the approach
        by the hybrid PSO combined with GA and Cauchy distribution (PSO + GA with
        CD).", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 1,

        conservation and carbon reduction development. Under this trend, light-emitting
        diodes (LEDs) are becoming the focus of the lighting industry. Because of
        the different levels or types of chips and substrates, the characteristics
        of products will be different. LED products are categorized according to characteristics
        such as luminescence efficiency, wavelength (color), and the reference voltage
        level. Traditionally, lack of good communication channels for production and
        sales department led to excessive inventories, even though the demand was
        satisfied. These products face the risk of being unsalable due to the short
        product life cycle. Therefore, this study developed a system for excelling
        enterprise resources (SEER) for LED manufacturing that optimizes chip procurement
        and production planning by linear programming. The system considered the deviation
        of the output distribution during the production to allocate the amount of
        chip and process to maximize profit. This study chooses the LED packaging
        company in Taiwan Hsinchu Science Park as an empirical case. We analyzed the
        different planning criteria to find some management rules and let this system
        become a communication tool between the production and sales department.",

        "Yield improvement is an important issue in semiconductor-manufacturing supply
        chains, including color filter and micro-lens manufacturing. In the color
        filter and micro-lens processes, it is critical to quickly identify the defect

        and subsequently production planning problems have raised many important research
        issues. The reentrant flow-shop (RFS) scheduling problem with time windows
        constraint for harddisk devices (HDD) manufacturing is one such problem of
        the expanded semiconductor industry. The RFS scheduling problem with the objective
        of minimizing the makespan of jobs is considered. Meeting this objective is
        directly related to maximizing the system throughput which is the most important
        of HDD industry requirements. Moreover, most manufacturing systems have to
        handle the quality of semiconductor material. The time windows constraint
        in the manufacturing system must then be considered. In this paper, we propose
        a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) for improving chromosomes/offspring by checking
        and repairing time window constraint and improving offspring by leftshift
        routines as a local search algorithm to solve effectively the RFS scheduling

        using a bi-objective genetic algorithm", "abstract": "Increasing global competition
        has forced high-tech companies to focus on their core competences and outsource
        other activities to maintain their competitive advantages in the supply chains.
        While most companies rely on domain experts to coordinate strategic outsourcing
        decisions among a number of qualified vendors with different capabilities,
        the present problem can be formulated into a complex nonlinear, multi-dimensional,
        multi-objective combinatorial optimisation problem. Focused on real settings,
        this study aims to fill the gap via developing a bi-objective genetic algorithm
        (boGA) for determining the outsourcing order allocation with nonlinear cost
        structure, while minimising both the total alignment gap and the total allocation
        cost. The proposed boGA incorporates specific random key representation to
        facilitate encoding and decoding. This study also develops a bi-objective
        Pareto solution generation algorithm to enable efficient searching of Pareto
        solutions in multiple ranks and designs a composite Pareto ranking selection
        with uniform sum rank weighting for effective selection. To estimate its validity,
        the proposed boGA was validated with realistic cases from a leading semiconductor
        company in Hsinchu Science Park in Taiwan. The optimal boGA parameters were
        tested using a set of experiments. Scenario analyses were conducted to evaluate
        the performance of the proposed algorithm under different demand conditions
        using the metrics in the literature. The results have shown the practical
        viability of the proposed algorithm to solve the present problem of monthly
        outsourcing decisions for the case company in practicable computation time.
        This algorithm can determine the near-optimal Pareto front for decision makers

        Algorithm (CEDA) to overcome the challenges mentioned before. The CEDA is
        established based on divide-and-conquer strategy and a co-evolutionary framework.
        Considerable experiments have been conducted and the results confirmed that
        CEDA outperforms recent research results for scheduling problems in FMS (Flexible
        Manufacturing Systems).", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 21,

        "abstract": "Scheduling is one of the most significant fields in manufacturing
        system. In this paper, we also consider how to handle materials during searching
        the optimal solutions of scheduling problem, because its impact in practical
        flexible manufacturing system (FMS) cannot be ignored. So we used the state-of-art
        automated guided vehicle (AGV) as a material-handling system in the FMS. We
        focus on the combination of an operation scheduling, which means to obtain
        the optimization of manufacturing scheduling, and the routing of AGVs, which
        is to transport materials of different operations between different machines
        in FMS. We use network structure to model FMS with AGV system as a material
        handling system. System constraints and decision variables about FMS especially
        related to AGVs dispatching can be presented on the network. That is to say
        that network modeling describes both operation scheduling information and
        AGV routing path information on a directed network model. We propose a random
        key-based particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with crossover and mutation
        operation to avoid premature convergence and to maintain diversity of the

        the complexity of processes involved in semiconductor manufacturing, increasingly
        high inspection costs associated with defective wafers has become a critical
        concern of modern manufacturers. More importantly, because of high-dimensional
        wafer bin maps (WBMs), it is difficult to capture the variations of each dimension
        via traditional pattern recognition or classification methods. By contrast,
        this work proposes a novel two-phase morphology-based similarity search consisting
        of: (1) training sample generation based on the morphological method and (2)
        SVM categorization for test datasets according to the variant degrees of similarities.
        The morphology-based samples contain five kinds of features, including original
        morphology definitions in addition to our proposed features. The second phase,
        using SVM for similarity searches, extends the usage of pattern recognition
        to real applications in large sample dimensions. The preliminary results demonstrate
        the usefulness of our approach in the context of yield improvements in semiconductor

        These data are usually used for fault detection and classification (FDC).
        However, unusual measurements may reflect a wafer defect or a change in equipment
        conditions. Early detection of the equipment condition changes assists with
        efficient maintenance. This study aimed to develop hierarchical indices that
        can be used for the conditional-based maintenance (CBM). For convenience,
        only the highest level index is used for real-time monitoring. Once this index
        decays, engineers could simply drill down to lower indices to identify the
        root cause. For validation, the proposed approach is conducted in a leading
        semiconductor foundry in Taiwan. The result shows that the highest index indicates
        the change of equipment conditions right after the preventive maintenance
        (PM).", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 23, "citationCount":

        of reducing the lengthy cycle times as a means to deal with the highly variable

        issue for semiconductor wafer fabrication companies to attain competitive
        advantages. \u2593 Semiconductor manufacturing has long time been recognized

        has been focusing on the concept of the borderless fab, which expands capacity

        for semiconductor wafer fabrication companies to maintain competitive advantages
        as the semiconductor industry is becoming more dynamic and changing faster.
        According to Little''s Law, while maintaining the same throughput level, the
        reduction in Work-in-Process (WIP) will result in cycle time reduction. On
        one hand, the existing queueing models for predicting the WIP of tool sets
        in wafer fabrication facilities (fab) have limitations in real settings. On
        the other hand, little research has been done to predict the WIP of tool sets
        with tool dedication and waiting time constraint so as to control the corresponding
        WIP levels of various tool sets to reduce cycle time without affecting throughput.
        This study aims to fill the gap by proposing a manufacturing intelligence
        (MI) approach based on neural networks (NNs) to exploit the value of the wealthy
        production data and tool data for predicting the WIP levels of the tool sets
        for cycle time reduction. To validate this approach, empirical data were collected
        and analyzed in a leading semiconductor company. The comparison results have
        shown practical viability of this approach. Furthermore, the proposed approach
        can identify and improve the critical input factors for reducing the WIP to

        under uncertainty", "abstract": "Capacity planning in semiconductor manufacturing
        industry is a challenging task due to its high capital investments, volatile
        demands, and the long lead time. Current approaches to handle this problem
        are to model it as an optimization problem where the uncertain demand is either
        based on a single forecast, or is decomposed via a finite-scenario structure
        with an assigned probability for each scenario to reflect the likelihood of
        occurrence. However, when the uncertainty cannot be decomposed into finite
        scenarios or when the number of possible scenarios is extremely large, traditional
        approaches such as the mathematical programming either cannot deal with the
        problem or may require unreasonable computing time. In this paper, we consider
        a multiple-period capacity planning problem where the uncertain demand is
        modeled as a continuous stochastic process over the planning horizon. Moreover,
        the long lead time and capacity migrations between different products are
        taken into account to accurately determine the optimal capacity plan. A new
        framework based on sample path method in simulation optimization is proposed
        to solve the problem. Comparing to traditional methods, the new framework
        is much more efficient in terms of the required computing time, as is demonstrated

        \u201cthe industry as a whole\u201d: Semiconductor industry as illustration",
        "abstract": "The discipline of industrial engineering has been declining in
        many countries in light of the changes of industry structures in developed
        countries, in which the competition is no longer among individual companies
        while the collaboration among horizontally specialized value providers are
        critical for the success of the individual companies as well as the whole
        supply chain. There should be a systematic methodology of \u201cindustrial
        engineering\u201d that focuses on \u201cindustry as a whole\u201d as the subject
        of study to differentiate our discipline from others such as electrical engineering
        or chemical engineering. Focusing on semiconductor industry as the specific
        subject, this study aims to propose a conceptual methodology of industrial
        engineering to investigate semiconductor industry. In particular, semiconductor
        industry is one of the most complicated and capital-intensive industries.
        Driven by Moore''s Law, semiconductor industry has a clock speed faster than
        other industries and thus can provide an important benchmark for other industries.
        In the presentation, we propose a framework to explain the evolution of the
        semiconductor industry from the point of view of modularity and integration
        driven by technical and economical considerations to simplify complex production
        problems. Several case studies of the companies in different positions of
        the semiconductor value chain are illustrated to discuss some of the challenges
        and ongoing changes. TSMC established a pure wafer foundry business model
        in 1987 that assumes all the costs of capital expenditure and expenses in
        wafer fabrication never competes with its clients of fabless design houses
        and IDMs. The pure foundry can easily scale up or down its production capacity
        according to an individual customer''s needs, while maximizing fab utilization
        with a portfolio of various customers. Such a business model freed fabless
        and IDM designers from the burden of capital investment for advanced technology
        capacity. Thus, IC designers can concentrate on chip design for various applications
        including PC and consumer electronics. Meanwhile, the semiconductor industry
        is moving to more narrow specialization such as Ardentec that focuses on the
        middle layer of wafer sort between front-end of IC design and wafer fabrication
        and backend of IC packaging and final testing. Nevertheless, Global Unichip
        Corporation that positions itself as a design foundry focusing on SoC (System
        on a Chip) is trying to virtually integrate the supply chain to deal with
        technical challenges driven by Moore''s Law and technological inseparability
        involved in SoC and SiP (System in Package). This talk will conclude with
        discussions of the implications of semiconductor industry evolution to computers
        and industrial engineering research.", "venue": "The 40th International Conference

        "The term \"White Box\" is often used to describe products without a brand
        name. Such products are assembled from standardized parts, and they became
        a very popular category of desktop PCs. Hsinchu, Taiwan based MediaTek is
        a fabless semiconductor company that unleashed a white box market in mobile
        phone handsets by offering an innovative \"complete solution\" for 2.5G and
        2.7G handset manufacturers, dramatically lowering the barriers to entry into
        the business. Besides enabling many Chinese branded manufacturers to enter
        the business, the grey market in components unleashed a complementary market
        of \"Shanzhai\" makers. Together these firms captured a significant fraction
        of the China market, as well as exports (both legal and grey) to 102 countries.
        CEO Ming-Kai Tsai is faced with the question of the best growth path. While
        multiple tier one handset makers are dismissive of MediaTek, perhaps because
        of its role in enabling the Shanzhai, the company''s offerings have enabled
        an \"army of ants\" to challenge the leaders. Can MediaTek move up-market

        to estimate indirect workforce requirements of semiconductor fabrication facilities
        (fabs) so that the workforce can be fairly allocated. There is a concern in
        a real setting to fairly allocate the overall corporate workforce among the
        fabs, particularly when they compete in performance, and properly determining
        the actual requirement is the most critical in the decision process. The actual
        requirements of the workforce, especially the indirect workforce, for fabs
        may be indeterminate due to the lack of a well-defined workforce-output relationship.
        This paper presents a non-parametric frontier approach for estimating the
        indirect workforce, and the estimate is based on the best past performance
        adjusted to reflect the expected productivity growth. An empirical study was
        conducted in a leading foundry in Taiwan that has a number of 8-inch fabs.
        The proposed (re)allocation approach can provide an explicit decision support
        mechanism to balance the workloads in light of various production environments
        to enable an equitable basis for performance evaluation to foster constructive
        competition among the fabs.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount":

        This research aims to develop an intelligent approach that integrates Genetic
        Algorithm (GA) and Data Mining (DM) approaches to resolve the physical therapy
        scheduling problems to reduce patient waiting time and thus enhance service
        quality. In particular, this approach employed the attribute-oriented induction
        method to extract the patterns of the solutions generated from the GA approach.
        Thus, the decision rules derived from the patterns can be applied to resolve
        similar therapy scheduling problems with much lesser computational effort.

        the practical viability of this approach.", "venue": "International Journal

        High-Tech Industry through Data Mining and Digital Management", "abstract":
        "As global competition continues to intensity in high-tech industry such as
        the semiconductor industry, wafer fabs have been placing more importance on
        the increase of die yield and the reduction of costs. Because of automatic
        manufacturing and information integration technologies, a large amount of
        raw data has been increasingly accumulated from various sources. Mining potentially
        useful information from such large databases becomes very important for high-tech
        industry to enhance operational excellence and thus maintain competitive advantages.
        However, little research has been done on manufacturing data of high-tech
        industry. Due to the complex fabrication processes, the data integration,
        system design, and requirement for cooperation among domain experts, IT specialists,
        and statisticians, the development and deployment of data mining applications
        is difficult. This chapter aims to describe characteristics of various data
        mining empirical studies in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly defect
        diagnosis and yield enhancement. We analyze engineering data and manufacturing
        data in different cases and discuss specific needs for data preparation in
        light of different characteristics of these data. This study concludes with
        several critical success factors for the development of data mining applications

        "Economic efficiency analysis of semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs)
        involves tradeoffs among cost, yield, and cycle time. Due to the disparate
        units involved, direct evaluation and comparison is difficult. This article
        employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) to determine relative efficiencies
        among fabs over time on the basis of empirical data, whereby cycle time performance
        is transformed into monetary value according to an estimated price decline
        rate. Two alternative DEA models are formulated to evaluate the influence
        of cycle time and other performance attributes. The results show that cycle
        time and yield follow increasing returns to scale, just as do cost and resource
        utilization. Statistical analyses are performed to investigate the DEA results,
        leading to specific improvement directions and opportunities for relatively
        inefficient fabs. Note to Practitioners-Speed of manufacturing is an important
        metric of factory performance, yet it has long been a challenge to integrate
        its value into overall performance evaluation. However, for many semiconductor
        products, a predictable rate of decline in selling prices makes it possible
        to transform time value into monetary value. This study employs a novel method
        to incorporate a speed metric into economic efficiency evaluation and thereby
        provide a guideline for improving fab efficiency in manufacturing practice.
        Furthermore, this study integrates factory productivity and cycle time into
        a relative efficiency analysis model that jointly evaluates the impact of
        these two factors in manufacturing performance. In particular, we validate
        this approach with data from ten leading wafer fabs obtained by the Competitive
        Semiconductor Manufacturing Program and we discuss managerial implications.",

        the number of gross dies per wafer and throughput. However, gross die number
        is influenced by die size in design phase, while the existing size of integrated
        circuit die was designed without considering the effect on wafer throughput
        in fabrication phase. This research aims to develop a die size optimization
        algorithm based on decision tree to construct the rules between the number
        of gross dies per wafer, mask utilization, and the die feature including length,
        width, and area. Without losing generality, an empirical study has been done
        for validation by using transformed data from a fab in Taiwan.", "venue":

        "title": "Data mining for improving the solder bumping process in the semiconductor
        packaging industry", "abstract": "Modern semiconductor manufacturing is very
        complex and expensive. Maintaining high quality and yield enhancement have
        been recognized as important factors to build core competences for semiconductor
        manufacturing companies. Data mining can find potentially useful information
        from huge databases. This paper proposes a data-mining framework based on
        decision-tree induction for improving the yield of the solder bumping process
        in which the various (physical and chemical) input variables that affect the
        bumping process exhibit highly complex interactions. We conducted an empirical
        study in a semiconductor fabrication facility in Taiwan to validate this approach.
        The results show that the proposed approach can effectively derive the causal
        relationships among controllable input process factors and the target class
        to enhance the yield. Copyright \u00a9 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "venue":

        "title": "Factor Analysis in Data Mining", "abstract": "The rapid growth and
        advances of information technology enable data to be accumulated faster and
        in much larger quantities (i.e., data warehousing). Faced with vast new information
        resources, scientists, engineers, and business people need efficient analytical
        techniques to extract useful information and effectively uncover new, valuable
        knowledge patterns. Data preparation is the beginning activity of exploring
        for potentially useful information. However, there may be redundant dimensions
        (i.e., variables) in the data, even after the data are well prepared. In this
        case, the performance of data-mining methods will be affected negatively by
        this redundancy. Factor Analysis (FA) is known to be a commonly used method,
        among others, to reduce data dimensions to a small number of substantial characteristics.
        FA is a statistical technique used to find an underlying structure in a set
        of measured variables. FA proceeds with finding new independent variables
        (factors) that describe the patterns of relationships among original dependent
        variables. With FA, a data miner can determine whether or not some variables
        should be grouped as a distinguishing factor, based on how these variables
        are related. Thus, the number of factors will be smaller than the number of
        original variables in the data, enhancing the performance of the data-mining
        task. In addition, the factors may be able to reveal underlying attributes
        that cannot be observed or interpreted explicitly so that, in effect, a reconstructed
        version of the data is created and used to make hypothesized conclusions.
        In general, FA is used with many data-mining methods (e.g., neural network,
        clustering). BACKGROUND", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "referenceCount": 11,

        the competitive advantages of their organizations. Therefore, developing Executive
        Information System (EIS) has become an important issue for both research and
        practical needs. However, few studies have been done to apply EIS in the hospital
        management. This study proposes a framework for constructing a Hospital Executive
        Information System (HEIS) based on the methodologies including system engineering,
        EIS, decision analysis, and key performance indexes. Furthermore, using a
        hospital as an empirical study, we construct a web-based HEIS with three functional
        modules including: i) an information preparation and visualization module;
        ii) an information retrieval and decision support module; and iii) a knowledge
        management module. The results of the empirical study show that HEIS can help
        managers to grasp important information before making decisions and thus improve
        the quality of their decisions.", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount":

        innovation of new process technologies in the semiconductor industry, especially
        12 inches Fab, along with continuously growing amounts of data, it is difficult
        to find root cause when problems occur in some process steps. It causes large
        amount of wafer scrapping. The analysis methods of traditional EDA system
        rely on experience of senior engineers. They need to define the suspected
        process step by their experience and then perform analysis. The analysis methods
        consume large amounts of human resources in order to determine the root cause
        of process and yield excursions. Hence, it is important that a knowledge retention
        method be incorporated to improve the efficiency of root cause analysis. Data
        mining, a new data analysis method that combines information science and technology
        of statistical analysis, is developed recently. The new generation data analysis
        method includes statistical, information science and mathematical calculation
        to find correlation between the target parameter, for example yield and other
        parameters. It will provide important clue to the analyzer. In addition, it
        also provides a direction to find root cause rapidly. It is difficult to find
        the correlation between the target parameter and other parameters by traditional
        statistical analysis method, and data mining can solve the blind point of
        the traditional method. This article discusses the design of how to define

        The indexes for semiconductor manufacturing management are complicated and
        interrelated. Therefore, it is hard to clarify the relationships among the
        indexes and to derive useful rules for production management. Existing approaches
        rely on following individual indexes without considering the production system
        as a whole. This study aims to fill the gap by reviewing the related studies
        on semiconductor manufacturing management and developing a complete set of
        performance indexes in hierarchy. In addition, we apply data mining techniques
        for analyzing production data collected in a semiconductor fab in Taiwan to
        validate this approach. The empirically derived patterns among the critical
        indexes were useful for supporting production management decisions. The results
        demonstrate the practical viability of this approach. This study concludes
        with results and discussion on future research.", "venue": "", "year": 2004,

        "title": "Global Manufacturing Network and Supply Chain Management for the
        Electronics Industry", "abstract": "Manufacturing industry is experiencing
        several fundamental changes. From industrial sector perspectives, in many
        industries such as home electronics appliance, computer, telecommunication,
        semiconductor, and even bio-technology, the traditional vertical-integrated
        company based business model has been dramatically replaced by collaborations
        between many fragmented but complementary and specialized value stars and
        value constellations. From geographic perspectives, more and more activities
        of value creation in manufacturing are reallocated in developing nations,
        especially in the Far East region where is emerging as a new factory of the
        world. From business dynamics perspectives, it is interesting to observe that,
        when some companies are seeking subcontracting or even hollowing-out by positioning
        themselves to engage with variously final customers directly, at the same
        time, others are accumulating up the outsourced tasks and sharply focusing
        on few core capable skills to provide operational service in a very professional
        way. It is more exciting to understand not only the interactions between original
        equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and electronics manufacturing service (EMS)
        providers but also their evolutionary adaptations and even place exchanges.
        In general, globalization between nations and collaboration between firms
        are deeply challenging the existing business models and classical concepts
        such as manufacturing, service, supply chain, and even firm or enterprise.
        This special issue of the International Journal of Business aims to address
        the critical issues involved in global manufacturing network by using electronics
        industry as a reference model. Conceptual models and quantitative analysis
        methodologies are proposed to deal with wide range of challenges of global
        manufacturing and supply chain via validation with empirical research and
        observation in real setting. Within the broad themes, this special issue addresses
        the following specific topics: * a transformation process from an technology
        imitator towards a leading innovator, * performance evaluation of research
        and development, * synchronization of global manufacturing and supply chain,
        * a new statistical process control methodology for LED industry, and * evaluation
        of government''s semiconductor industry development strategy. This special
        issue not only covers the different levels of management and decision issues
        in the global manufacturing network and supply chain but also provides more
        up-dated management experiences and background from the Far East region where
        is becoming a more and more important region powering the world economy. The
        articles provide fresh insights and experiences from the newly developed and
        developing nations including China, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea. From
        the papers'' research and discussions, several key issues and academic agenda
        have been also arisen. Firstly, global manufacturing network and supply chain
        is a very complex system. This special issue just explored a very limited
        part of it. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        this study data envelopment analysis (DEA) models were applied to evaluate
        the relative efficiencies of twenty-two electricity distribution districts
        of the Taiwan Power Company (TPC) in Taiwan. The empirical study showed that
        the TPC districts have good overall efficiency. We found that eleven districts
        were inefficient. Most of the inefficient districts suffer from scale inefficiency
        to a greater degree than technical inefficiency. We suggested the specific
        improvement directions for the corresponding inefficient districts. This study
        also investigated district reorganization to increase the efficiency. The
        proposed district reorganization alternatives have higher efficiency scores
        than the current one.", "venue": "IEEE Power Engineering Review", "year":

        "abstract": "Semiconductor manufacturing industry competes by increasing yield
        and lowering die costs, thereby taking advantage of significant capital investments.
        Many studies focus on defect reduction to improve yield rate. However, the
        problem of optimizing wafer exposure patterns has received little attention.
        In this paper, given the specific patterning constraints, we develop a two-dimensional
        (2-D) cutting algorithm to maximize the gross die yields of the eight-inch
        wafer and larger circular wafers. The empirical results that we implemented
        in a wafer fabrication factory in Taiwan validate the practical viability
        of this approach. Similar approaches can readily be applied to other wafer
        patterning.", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 8, "citationCount":

        "title": "A cost-based heuristic for statistically determining sampling frequency
        in a wafer fab", "abstract": "In wafer fabrication, because of the long cycle
        time, the high yield uncertainty and the high manufacturing cost, earlier
        process monitoring and control are critical. Thus, a number of inspection
        and measurement stations are set in the fabrication process to assure that
        the wafer quality meets the specific requirements. Researchers have applied
        the acceptance sampling plan to determine whether a lot is accepted or not.
        Due to the limited capacities and costs for in-line wafer inspections, only
        certain wafers are inspected among a specific number of lots. Thus, it is
        important to determine the sampling strategy that minimizes the total expected
        costs, including the inspection costs, false-alarm costs, out-of-control costs,
        in-control costs, and the costs from the false-passed wafers. In this study,
        we developed a cost-based heuristic for statistically determining the sampling
        frequency in wafer fab based on the economics, control chart design, Bayesian
        decision analysis, and the acceptance sampling strategy. We aimed to determine
        the optimal sampling frequency that trades off the various risks (i.e. the
        aggregation of cost and probability).", "venue": "2000 Semiconductor Manufacturing

        here for the modelling of shop floor control systems. The major idea is to
        convert the static structure and the dynamic behaviour of a controlled system
        into the functional specification of a controlling system by using some modelling
        techniques. Then the shop floor control logic is translated into the language
        of the G2 expert system. In this way, it is easier to achieve the computer-integrated
        manufacturing (CIM) at the shop floor level. The proposed method is different
        from the procedure-oriented method, which is based on the functional decomposition
        of a system, and has the potential to be applied to more complex systems.
        During the modelling process, its modularity and reusability can dramatically
        reduce the complexity in system analysis and provides more flexibility for
        system development. The design of the shop floor control system of a mould-filling
        shop is used to illustrate the proposed method.", "venue": "International

        debugging", "abstract": "One of the interesting problems in hardware-software
        co-design is that of debugging embedded software in conjunction with hardware.
        Currently, most software designers wait until a working hardware prototype
        is available before debugging software. Bugs discovered in hardware during
        the software debugging phase require re-design and re-fabrication, thereby
        not only delaying the project but also increasing cost. It also puts software
        debugging on hold until a new hardware prototype is available. In this paper
        we describe a hardware-software co-simulator that can be used in the design,
        debugging and verification of embedded systems. This tool contains simulators
        for different parts of the system and a backplane which is used to integrate
        the simulators. This enables us to simulate hardware, software and their interaction
        efficiently. We also address the problem of simulation speed. Currently, the
        more accurate (in terms of timing) the models used, the longer it takes to
        simulate a system. Our main contribution is a set of techniques to speed up
        simulation of processors and peripherals without significant loss in timing
        accuracy. Finally, we describe applications used to test the co-simulator
        and our experience in using it.", "venue": "Proceedings of ASP-DAC''95/CHDL''95/VLSI''95

        "title": "Teaching geometry effectively with dynamic software Report", "abstract":
        "This workshop examined issues related to the effective teaching of geometry
        with dynamic geometry software. The discussions mainly focused on the development
        and use of curriculum-related sketches that are either partially constructed,
        or pre-constructed. Examples of web-based and program-based sketches created
        with Geometer''s Sketchpad and Cinderella were presented and discussed in
        light of research results and the experience of participants. An important
        theme throughout the discussions was how to address the needs of teachers
        \u2013 to develop greater geometric knowledge, to access welldesigned materials,
        and to acquire technological skills. In light of the theme of critical thinking
        we began by examining how pre-constructed dynamic geometry sketches can help
        students think about and analyse mathematical ideas. In our definition of
        pre-constructed sketches we included both web-based and program-based dynamic
        geometry sketches, whether prepared by teachers, by researchers, or by professional
        applet designers. Some of these could more properly be named \u201cpartially-constructed\u201d,
        since students are able to alter any program-based sketch and some web-based
        sketches. Sinclair presented some results from a study that involved grade
        12 students using preconstructed web-based sketches. Her research showed that
        to benefit from using dynamic pre-constructed sketches, students must learn:
        a) to notice (i.e., to notice detail in static images, to notice change in
        dynamic images and to apply mathematical knowledge to make sense of the information);
        b) to pose (their own) questions; and c) to explore. The development of these
        skills depends both on pedagogical interventions and on the creation of appropriate
        learning objects. With regard to pedagogy, teachers who want to use dynamic
        software activities face new challenges. For example, there is a great deal
        of talk about \u201cinvestigations\u201d in mathematics classes; however,
        unlike investigators who continually re-evaluate their progress, and determine
        how to proceed, students often rely on the teacher to suggest the next step
        or ask the question that will guide further exploration. Sinclair found that
        students working in pairs in a lab environment are often unable to engage
        in fruitful ongoing investigation if they cannot pose their own questions.
        We discussed the importance of helping inservice and preservice teachers learn
        how to make effective use of dynamic software tasks. Good design decisions
        (i.e., what colours to use; whether to display tick marks or measurements;
        whether to animate) are intimately related to knowledge of what helps us",
