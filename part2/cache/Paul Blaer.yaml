        The Autonomous Vehicle for Exploration and Navigation of Urban Environments
        (AVENUE) mobile robot was successfully used to generate such maps in both
        manual and autonomous modes of operation. The resulting database contained
        a wealth of information for many different positions in the region, with a
        list of all access points viewable from each location together with a quality
        measure (the signal-to-noise ratio) of every detected signal. At a later time,
        the AVENUE system effectively used the data in this map to determine the approximate
        position of the robot as it traveled through the urban area.", "venue": "IEEE

        using color histogram matching of omnidirectional images. The system is intended
        for use as a navigational tool for the autonomous vehicle for exploration
        and navigation of urban environments (AVENUE) mobile robot. Our method makes
        use of omnidirectional images which are acquired from the robot''s on-board
        camera. The method is fast and rotation invariant. Our tests have indicated
        that normalized color histograms are best for an outdoor environment while
        normalization is not required for indoor work. The system quickly narrows
        down the robot''s location to one or two regions within the much larger test
        environment. Using this regional localization information, other vision systems
        that we have developed can further localize the robot.", "venue": "Proceedings

        "This paper is an overview of the AVENUE project at Columbia University. AVENUE''s
        main goal is to automate the site modeling process in urban environments.
        The first component of AVENUE is a 3-D modeling system which constructs complete
        3-D geometric models with photometric texture mapping acquired from different
        viewpoints. The second component is a planning system that plans the Next-Best-View
        for acquiring a model of the site. The third component is a mobile robot we
        have built that contains an integrated sensor suite for automatically performing
        the site modeling task. We present results for modeling buildings in New York
