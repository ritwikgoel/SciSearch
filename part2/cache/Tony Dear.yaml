        of robotics applications, but learning locomotion for robots with unconventional
        configurations is still limited. Prior work has shown that, despite the simple
        modeling of articulated swimmer robots, such systems struggle to find effective
        gaits using reinforcement learning due to the heterogeneity of the search
        space. In this work, we leverage insight from geometric models of these robots
        in order to focus on promising regions of the space and guide the learning
        process. We demonstrate that our augmented learning technique is able to produce

        "title": "Swim: A General-Purpose, High-Performing, and Efficient Activation
        Function for Locomotion Control Tasks", "abstract": "Activation functions
        play a significant role in the performance of deep learning algorithms. In
        particular, the Swish activation function tends to outperform ReLU on deeper
        models, including deep reinforcement learning models, across challenging tasks.
        Despite this progress, ReLU is the preferred function partly because it is
        more efficient than Swish. Furthermore, in contrast to the fields of computer
        vision and natural language processing, the deep reinforcement learning and
        robotics domains have seen less inclination to adopt new activation functions,
        such as Swish, and instead continue to use more traditional functions, like
        ReLU. To tackle those issues, we propose Swim, a general-purpose, efficient,
        and high-performing alternative to Swish, and then provide an analysis of
        its properties as well as an explanation for its high-performance relative
        to Swish, in terms of both reward-achievement and efficiency. We focus on
        testing Swim on MuJoCo''s locomotion continuous control tasks since they exhibit
        more complex dynamics and would therefore benefit most from a high-performing
        and efficient activation function. We also use the TD3 algorithm in conjunction
        with Swim and explain this choice in the context of the robot locomotion domain.
        We then conclude that Swim is a state-of-the-art activation function for continuous
        control locomotion tasks and recommend using it with TD3 as a working framework.",

        "title": "The Geometric Structure of Externally Actuated Planar Locomoting
        Systems in Ambient Media", "abstract": "Robots often interact with the world
        via attached parts such as wheels, joints, or appendages. In many systems,
        these interactions, and the manner in which they lead to locomotion, can be
        understood using the machinery of geometric mechanics, explaining how inputs
        in the shape space of a robot affect motion in its configuration space and
        the configuration space of its environment. In this paper we consider an opposite
        type of locomotion, wherein robots are influenced actively by interactions
        with an externally forced ambient medium. We investigate two examples of externally
        actuated systems; one for which locomotion is governed by a principal connection,
        and is usually considered to possess no drift dynamics, and another for which
        no such connection exists, with drift inherent in its locomotion. For the
        driftless system, we develop geometric tools based on previously understood
        internally actuated versions of the system and demonstrate their use for motion
        planning under external actuation. For the system possessing drift, we employ
        nonholonomic reduction to obtain a reduced representation of the system dynamics,
        illustrate geometric features conducive to studying locomotion, and derive

        locomoting robots assume control over all input degrees of freedom (DOFs).
        Many robots, such as those with non-holonomic constraints, may not require
        or even allow for direct command over all DOFs. In particular, a snake robot
        with more than three links with non-holonomic constraints cannot achieve arbitrary
        configurations in all of its joints while simultaneously locomoting. For such
        a system, we assume partial command over a subset of the joints, and allow
        the rest to evolve according to kinematic chained and dynamic models. Different
        combinations of actuated and passive joints, as well as joints with dynamic
        elements such as torsional springs, can drastically change the coupling interactions
        and stable oscillations of joints. We use tools from nonlinear analysis to
        understand emergent oscillation modes of various robot configurations and
        connect them to overall locomotion using geometric mechanics and feedback
        control for robots that may not fully utilize all available inputs. We also

        a number of systems with the structure of a principal ?fiber bundle. This

        to various robotic confi?gurations in diff?erent environments, but it also
        requires a number of assumptions that limit its usefulness to certain \\idealized\"

        or cannot make full use of the subsequent tools include those whose joints
        are not fully controllable, those with control inputs or dynamics external
        to their mechanism, and those whose external con?figurations do not forma

        structure have traditionally assumed a mapping from internal joint confi?gurations

        "title": "Experimental Gait Analysis of Waveboard Locomotion", "abstract":
        "Through modeling and experimentation, we analyze common gaits on a waveboard,
        an underactuated mechanical system whose motion is governed by both nonholonomic
        constraints and momentum conservation. We take advantage of the system''s
        symmetries to derive a reduced system model that differentiates between kinematic
        and dynamic components of motion. We evaluate this model using marker trajectory
        data gathered through an optical tracking system for various types of gaits.
        By extracting relevant trajectory parameters via state reconstruction and
        fitting our joint variables to an ellipse, we determine the kinematic components
        of gaits commonly used by human riders. In particular, we demonstrate that
        traditional forward motion is purely dynamic, while sustained turning motion
        contains kinematic components. In order to validate our model, we compare
        experimentally obtained trajectories with reconstructed displacements based
        on the model. Finally, we suggest an approach for further analysis of the
        dynamic components of these gaits. INTRODUCTION The waveboard, also known
        as the essboard, caster board, vigor board, and ripstik, is a skateboard variant
        in which two platforms, each resting upon a caster wheel, are constrained
        to rotate about the same axis and coupled with a torsional spring. It is a
        mixed mechanical system whose motion is governed by both nonholonomic velocity
        constraints and momentum conservation. It is modeled similarly to the variable
        inertia snakeboard examined by Shammas et al. [1], who used geometric mechanics
        to differentiate between kinematic and dynamic components of motion. Relative
        to traditional two-wheel drive systems, the waveboard possesses greater maneuverability
        and potentially higher efficiency at the expense of stability. Modeling insight
        could be used by designers to optimize kinematic parameters of waveboards
        in light of ergonomic considerations. More generally, analysis of the locomotive
        capabilities of this system informs control and planning of highly dynamic
        mobile robots. Although the waveboard itself has not appeared often in geometric
        mechanics literature, the snakeboard is a similar system that has received
        considerable attention in the context of underactuated systems and controllability
        of nonholonomic mechanical systems. The snakeboard was first analyzed as a
        nonholonomic mechanical system by Ostrowski et al. [2]. Shammas et al. [1]
        analyzed and generated gaits for mixed mechanical systems using height functions
        to analyze geometric phase shift, as well as a novel scaled momentum and gamma
        functions to evaluate dynamic phase shift. In [1, 3], Shammas et al. classified
        gaits into three different categories: purely kinematic, purely dynamic, and
        kino-dynamic. More recently, Shammas and de Oliveira provided an analytical
        solution to snakeboard motion planning [4]. Dear et al. [5] built upon their
        work using body coordinates and local trajectory information to address trajectory
        generation. Dear et al. [6] also incorporated dissipative friction in the
        traveling direction and skidding in the snakeboard model, investigating these
        effects on trajectory planning. Asnafi and Mahzoon [7] generated some flower-like
        gaits for the snakeboard. Similar geometric approaches can be applied to the
        waveboard in order to analyze its locomotive capabilities. This paper addresses
        the challenge of modeling and characterizing motions of the waveboard. In
        the next section, we present a model for the waveboard and derive its reconstruction
        equation. Subsequent sections describe experimental methodology and analysis
        of common types of gaits in the framework of geometric mechanics. Correlations
        between configurational variations and trajectory parameters are investigated,
        and numerically reconstructed forward motion displacements are compared with
        experimental data.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount": 10, "citationCount":

        objective of this work is emulating the aggressive and large angle correction
        maneuvers, like somersaults, that are performed by human divers. To this end,
        a planar three link robot, called DiverBot, is proposed. By considering a
        gravity-free scenario, a local connection is obtained between joint angles
        and the body orientation, resulting in a reduction in the system dynamics.
        An optimal control policy applied on this reduced configuration space yielded
        diving maneuvers that are dynamically feasible. Numerical results show that
        the DiverBot can execute one somersault without drift and multiple somersaults
        with minimal drift.", "venue": "IEEE/RJS International Conference on Intelligent

        "Biologically inspired robots perform many interesting and useful behaviors,
        but to effectively emulate their biological counterparts, robots often need
        to possess many degrees of freedom, complicating their mechanical design and
        making it difficult to apply standard control and motion planning strategies.
        To address this complexity, the robotics community has derived low-dimensional
        parameter-based controllers that naturally coordinate many degrees of freedom
        such as the serpenoid curves used to control snake robots. Controllers utilizing
        this parameterization for snake robots have been able to induce behaviors
        similar to that of the robots'' biological counterparts. A similar concept,
        called a control template, is used in the study of animal movements. However,
        much of the prior work on control templates has been limited to in-plane motion.
        In this work, we extend the usage of control templates to three dimensions
        to both better model and understand biology, as well as to help us gain better

        "We address trajectory generation for the snakeboard, a system commonly studied
        in the geometric mechanics community. Our approach derives a solution using
        body coordinates and local trajectory information, leading to a more intuitive
        solution compared to prior work. The simple forms of the solution clearly
        show how they depend on local curvature and desired velocity profile, allowing
        for a description of some simple motion primitives. We readily propose techniques
        to navigate paths, including those with sharp corners, by taking advantage
        of the snakeboard\u2019s singular configuration, as well as discuss some implications
        of torque limits.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount":
