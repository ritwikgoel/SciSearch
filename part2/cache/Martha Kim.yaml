        response to strict power constraints and diminishing single-core performance
        returns, the hardware industry has shifted en masse to parallel multicore
        chips. In theory, parallel processing can match historic performance gains
        while meeting modern power budgets, but as recent studies show, that this
        requires near-perfect application parallelization [7]. In practice, perfect
        or near-perfect parallelization is often unachievable: most algorithms have
        inherently serial portions and incur synchronization overheads in their parallel
        portions. Furthermore, parallel software requires drastic changes in how software
        is written, tested, and debugged. Application-specific integrated circuits
        (ASICs) are the gold standard for computational power and performance efficiency,
        but it is uneconomical and impractical to produce a custom chip for every
        application. As a result most chips are likely to remain programmable, and,
        ideally, deliver custom-caliber efficiency in a general-purpose setting. Hardware
        accelerators, such as graphics coprocessors, cryptographic accelerators [10]
        or network processors [5] provide this for their target domain, but have usually
        had awkward, ad hoc interfaces that made them difficult to utilize and tended
        to impede software portability. In this paper, we argue that general-purpose
        processors should be supplemented with abstract datatype processors (or ADPs)
        to deliver custom hardware performance in a form palatable to software. Abstract
        datatype instructions (or ADIs) implement operations on high-level data types
        such as hash tables, XML DOMs, relational database tables, and other types
        in common use in software. In object-oriented terminology, each ADI directly
        implements one public method of a class. By encapsulating richer algorithms
        and data than the usual fine-grained arithmetic, memory, and control-transfer
        instructions, ADIs provide ample implementation optimization opportunities
        in the form of an already familiar programming interface. Architects have
        made heroic efforts to quickly execute streams of fine-grained instructions,
        but their hands have been tied by the narrow scope of program information
        that conventional ISAs afford to hardware. ADIs release these restraints.
        Good software programming practice has long encouraged the use of carefully
        written, well-optimized libraries instead of manual implementations of all
        functionality; ADIs simply supply such libraries in a new form.", "venue":

        per die increases, be they processors, memory blocks, or custom accelerators,
        the on-chip interconnect the cores use to communicate gains importance. We
        begin this study with an area-performance analysis of the interconnect design

        performance across a range of traffic patterns. This indicates that there
        is an opportunity to gain performance by customizing the interconnect to a
        particular application or workload. We propose polymorphic on-chip networks
        to enable per-application network customization. This network can be configured
        prior to application runtime, to have the topology and buffering of arbitrary
        network designs. This paper proposes one such polymorphic network architecture.
        We demonstrate its modes of configurability, and evaluate the polymorphic
        network architecture design space, producing polymorphic fabrics that minimize
        the network area overhead. Finally, we expand the network on chip design space

        "title": "Architectural implications of brick and mortar silicon manufacturing",
        "abstract": "We introduce a novel chip fabrication technique called \"brick
        and mortar\", in which chips are made from small, pre-fabricated ASIC bricks
        and bonded in a designer-specified arrangement to an inter-brick communication
        backbone chip. The goal of brick and mortar assembly is to provide a low-overhead
        method to produce custom chips, yet with performance that tracks an ASIC more
        closely than an FPGA. This paper examines the architectural design choices
        in this chip-design system. These choices include the definition of reasonable
        bricks, both in functionality and size, as well as the communication interconnect
        that the I/O cap provides. To do this we synthesize candidate bricks, analyze
        their area and bandwidth demands, and present an architectural design for
        the inter-brick communication network. We discuss a sample chip design, a
        16-way CMP, and analyze the costs and benefits of designing chips with brick
        and mortar. We find that this method of producing chips incurs only a small
        performance loss (8%) compared to a fully custom ASIC, which is significantly
        less than the degradation seen from other low-overhead chip options, such
        as FPGAs. Finally, we measure the effect that architectural design decisions

        continue to provide an exponential increase in the availability of raw transistors.
        Effectively translating this resource into application performance, however,
        is an open challenge that conventional superscalar designs will not be able
        to meet. We present WaveScalar as a scalable alternative to conventional designs.
        WaveScalar is a dataflow instruction set and execution model designed for
        scalable, low-complexity/high-performance processors. Unlike previous dataflow
        machines, WaveScalar can efficiently provide the sequential memory semantics
        that imperative languages require. To allow programmers to easily express
        parallelism, WaveScalar supports pthread-style, coarse-grain multithreading
        and dataflow-style, fine-grain threading. In addition, it permits blending
        the two styles within an application, or even a single function.\n To execute
        WaveScalar programs, we have designed a scalable, tile-based processor architecture
        called the WaveCache. As a program executes, the WaveCache maps the program''s
        instructions onto its array of processing elements (PEs). The instructions
        remain at their processing elements for many invocations, and as the working
        set of instructions changes, the WaveCache removes unused instructions and
        maps new ones in their place. The instructions communicate directly with one
        another over a scalable, hierarchical on-chip interconnect, obviating the
        need for long wires and broadcast communication.\n This article presents the
        WaveScalar instruction set and evaluates a simulated implementation based
        on current technology. For single-threaded applications, the WaveCache achieves
        performance on par with conventional processors, but in less area. For coarse-grain
        threaded applications the WaveCache achieves nearly linear speedup with up
        to 64 threads and can sustain 7--14 multiply-accumulates per cycle on fine-grain
        threaded versions of well-known kernels. Finally, we apply both styles of
        threading to equake from Spec2000 and speed it up by 9x compared to the serial

        "This paper explores hierarchical instruction scheduling for a tiled processor.
        Our results show that at the top level of the hierarchy, a simple profile-driven
        algorithm effectively minimizes operand latency. After this schedule has been
        partitioned into large sections, the bottom-level algorithm must more carefully
        analyze program structure when producing the final schedule.Our analysis reveals
        that at this bottom level, good scheduling depends upon carefully balancing
        instruction contention for processing elements and operand latency between
        producer and consumer instructions. We develop a parameterizable instruction
        scheduler that more effectively optimizes this trade-off. We use this scheduler
        to determine the contention-latency sweet spot that generates the best instruction
        schedule for each application. To avoid this application-specific tuning,
        we also determine the parameters that produce the best performance across
        all applications. The result is a contention-latency setting that generates
        instruction schedules for all applications in our workload that come within

        "title": "Modeling instruction placement on a spatial architecture", "abstract":
        "In response to current technology scaling trends, architects are developing
        a new style of processor, known as spatial computers. A spatial computer is
        composed of hundreds or even thousands of simple, replicated processing elements
        (or PEs), frequently organized into a grid. Several current spatial computers,
        such as TRIPS, RAW, SmartMemories, nanoFabrics and WaveScalar, explicitly
        place a program''s instructions onto the grid. Designing instruction placement
        algorithms is an enormous challenge, as there are an exponential (in the size
        of the application) number of different mappings of instructions to PEs, and
        the choice of mapping greatly affects program performance. In this paper we
        develop an instruction placement performance model which can inform instruction
        placement. The model comprises three components, each of which captures a
        different aspect of spatial computing performance: inter-instruction operand
        latency, data cache coherence overhead, and contention for processing element
        resources. We evaluate the model on one spatial computer, WaveScalar, and
        find that predicted and actual performance correlate with a coefficient of
        -0.90. We demonstrate the model''s utility by using it to design a new placement
        algorithm, which outperforms our previous algorithms. Although developed in
        the context of WaveScalar, the model can serve as a foundation for tuning
        code, compiling software, and understanding the microarchitectural trade-offs

        "title": "Reducing control overhead in dataflow architectures", "abstract":
        "In recent years, computer architects have proposed tiled architectures in
        response to several emerging problems in processor design, such as design
        complexity, wire delay, and fabrication reliability. One of these architectures,
        WaveScalar, uses a dynamic, tagged-token dataflow execution model to simplify
        the design of the processor tiles and their interconnection network and to
        achieve good parallel performance. However, using a dataflow execution model
        reawakens old problems, including the instruction overhead required for control
        flow. Previous work compiling the functional language Id to the Monsoon Dataflow
        System found this overhead to be 2\u20133\u00d7 that of programs written in
        C and targeted to a MIPS R3000. In this paper, we present and analyze three
        compiler optimizations that significantly reduce control overhead with minimal
        additional hardware. We begin by describing how to translate imperative code
        into dataflow assembly and analyze the resulting control overhead. We report
        a similar 2\u20134\u00d7 instruction overhead, which suggests that the execution
        model, rather than a specific source language or target architecture, is responsible.
        Then, we present the compiler optimizations, each of which is designed to
        eliminate a particular type of control overhead, and analyze the extent to
        which they were able to do so. Finally, we evaluate the effect using all optimizations
        together has on program performance. Together, the optimizations reduce control
        overhead by 80% on average, increasing application performance between 21\u201337%.",

        "title": "Area-Performance Trade-offs in Tiled Dataflow Architectures", "abstract":
        "Tiled architectures, such as RAW, SmartMemories, TRIPS, and WaveScalar, promise
        to address several issues facing conventional processors, including complexity,
        wire-delay, and performance. The basic premise of these architectures is that
        larger, higher-performance implementations can be constructed by replicating
        the basic tile across the chip. This paper explores the area-performance trade-offs
        when designing one such tiled architecture, WaveScalar. We use a synthesizable
        RTL model and cycle-level simulator to perform an area/performance pareto
        analysis of over 200 WaveScalar processor designs ranging in size from 19mm2
        to 575mm2 and having a 22 FO4 cycle time. We demonstrate that, for multi-threaded
        workloads, WaveScalar performance scales almost ideally from 19 to 101mm 2
        when optimized for area efficiency and from 44 to 202mm2 when optimized for
        peak performance. Our analysis reveals that WaveScalar''s hierarchical interconnect
        plays an important role in overall scalability, and that WaveScalar achieves
        the same (or higher) performance in substantially less area than either an
        aggressive out-of-order superscalar or Sun''s Niagara CMP processor", "venue":

        evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in 46 eyes
        of 23 myopic children over the course of 4 years. Using serial OCT images
        acquired based on a fixed scan circle in the glaucoma progression analysis
        mode, general and sectoral RNFL thicknesses were acquired at the same position
        and the angular location of the peak was measured. The peripapillary choroidal
        thickness likewise was measured at eight positions in serial OCT images. Results
        The mean age at the baseline was 9.6\u00b11.7 years. The mean axial length
        increased from 24.80\u00b11.28 mm to 25.64\u00b11.35 mm. The global peripapillary
        RNFL thickness was 98.54\u00b112.06 \u00b5m at baseline. The global and sectoral
        RNFL thicknesses did not change during the 4 years. The angular location of
        RNFL peaks was also stable and was located in the superotemporal (64.18\u00b110.85\u00b0)
        and inferotemporal (293.98\u00b111.62\u00b0) sectors. The global peripapillary
        choroidal thickness was 145.40\u00b128.67 \u00b5m at the baseline. The global
        and sectoral choroidal thicknesses did not change during the 4 years. Conclusions
        The peripapillary RNFL and choroidal thicknesses as well as the locations

        central retinal vascular trunk (CRVT), as a surrogate of lamina cribrosa (LC)
        offset, was associated with the presence of glaucoma in normal-tension glaucoma
        (NTG) patients. Methods The position of the CRVT was measured as the deviation
        from the center of the Bruch\u2019s membrane opening (BMO), as delineated
        by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging. The offset index
        was calculated as the distance of the CRVT from the BMO center relative to
        that of the BMO margin. The angular deviation of CRVT was measured with the
        horizontal nasal midline as 0\u00b0 and the superior location as a positive
        value. The offset index and angular deviation were compared between glaucoma
        and fellow control eyes within individuals. Results NTG eyes had higher baseline
        intraocular pressure (P = 0.001), a larger \u03b2-zone parapapillary atrophy
        area (P = 0.013), and a larger offset index (P<0.001). In a generalized linear
        mixed-effects model, larger offset index was the only risk factor of NTG diagnosis
        (OR = 31.625, P<0.001). A generalized estimating equation regression model
        revealed that the offset index was larger in the NTG eyes than in the control
        eyes for all ranges of axial length, while it was the smallest for the axial
        length of 23.4 mm (all P<0.001). Conclusions The offset index was larger in

        effect of anisometropia", "abstract": "Abstract The effect of small anisometropia
        on visual fatigue when using virtual reality (VR) devices was investigated.
        Participants (n\u2009=\u200934) visited three times. In the first visit, VR
        exposure (10\u2009min) was conducted with the full correction of the refractive
        error of both eyes. Experimental anisometropia was induced by adding a\u2009+\u20091.0
        dioptre spherical lens either on the dominant eyes in the second visit or
        on the non-dominant eyes in the third visit. At each visit, the participants
        played a predetermined video game using a head-mounted display VR for 10\u2009min.
        Visual fatigue was assessed before and after playing VR game using the Virtual
        Reality Symptom Questionnaire (VRSQ) and high-frequency component of accommodative
        microfluctuation. Results showed that watching VR induced significant increase
        of VRSQ score, significant decrease in the maximum accommodation power and
        objective increase in visual fatigue. Experimental anisometropia induction
        either on the dominant or non-dominant eyes did not aggravate visual fatigue.
        Practitioner summary: Mild differences in refractive error (up to 1.0 dioptre)
        between both eyes do not significantly increase ocular fatigue by viewing
        virtual reality device (10\u2009min). The impact of small anisometropia may
        be limited in developing a virtual reality device. Abbreviations: VR: virtual

        "title": "A Case Report of Hemodialysis Graft-induced Increased Intraocular
        Pressure.", "abstract": "Dear Editor, Hemodialysis is performed in the patients
        with end-stage renal disease, and arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is regarded
        as the best type of hemodialysis access [1]. However, various complications,
        such as thrombosis, stenosis and infection have been reported [2]. In the
        field of ophthalmology, rare cases of increased intraocular pressure (IIOP)
        related to hemodialytic condition have been reported [2]. In this study, we
        report the case of a patient who presented with IIOP, severe headache, and
        prolonged choroidal detachment due to abnormal venous drainage. A 50-year-old
        Korean man, with end-stage renal disease and in a hemodialysis program for
        8 years, presented with IIOP in his left eye. His right eye was blinded due
        to a history of surgery for retinal detachment, and he was undergoing treatment
        for chronic open-angle glaucoma in his left eye. Visual acuity was 20 / 25,
        IOP was 18 mmHg, and spherical equivalent was -0.375 diopter. Ocular examination
        revealed regular pseudophakia, axial length of 23.13 mm and central corneal
        thickness of 507 \u03bcm. Fundus exam showed a pale optic disc and a diffuse
        superior thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. He underwent trabeculectomy
        due to IIOP even with the maximum tolerated medical therapy. After surgery,
        the IOP decreased to 9 mmHg, but choroidal detachment was developed. Nine
        days after surgery, he presented with severe headache and ocular pain. The
        IOP increased to 25 mmHg, and functional filtration bleb formed by trabeculectomy
        was not well elevated. In addition, although the IOP was elevated, no significant
        improvement in choroidal detachment was observed (Fig. 1A, 1B). Afterwards,
        the status of choroidal detachment tended to wax and wane, although the IOP
        was maintained relatively high. He underwent brain work-up, and result showed
        f low signs on left internal jugular vein (IJV) with a significant dilatation
        in the arterial phase (Fig. 1C). Due to the suspicion that the IIOP may be
        related to an abnormality in the hemodialytic vessels, he underwent fistulography
        to check the arteriovenous f low. Surprisingly, fistulography confirmed that
        the venous flow of the cephalic vein in the AVF circuit was directly joined
        to the IJV, and not to the subclavian vein, inducing venous reflux to the
        brain (Fig. 1D). He underwent a left cephalic vein ligation and new AVF formation
        in the right side. After surgery, the IOP decreased to 16 mmHg on the first
        day and 6 mmHg on the second day, and the patient\u2019s subjective symptoms
        also improved. After two weeks, IOP was stable and the visual acuity was improved
        to 20 / 40. In addition, a remarkable improvement of choroidal detachment
        over time was observed, which completely resolved after two months. He was

        behavior study for glaucoma treatment.", "abstract": "Incidence of glaucoma,
        a severe disease leading to irreversible loss of vision, is increasing with
        global aging populations. Lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only
        proven treatment method for glaucoma. Nitric oxide (NO) is an emerging material
        targeting the conventional outflow pathway by relaxing the trabecular meshwork
        (TM). However, there is little understanding on NO level effective to IOP
        lowering without toxicity. Here we report a novel long-term NO-releasing polydiazeniumdiolate
        (NOP) that enables lowering IOP via the conventional outflow pathway. NOP
        is composed of carbon-bound polydiazeniumdiolate, stable NO donor moiety.
        NO release was monitored with accurate parameters by detection of real-time
        gas and accumulated form. Based on the NO release information, the selected
        safe level of NOP exhibited effective TM relaxation and potential an IOP lowering
        effect in vivo without side effects. This work provides new insights to nitric
        oxide release behavior that should be considered for glaucoma treatment.",

        different growth between retinal and scleral layers during eyeball expansion.
        The shift index was compared between OAG and fellow control eyes within individuals
        (129 OAG patients). Although OAG eyes also had higher baseline IOP, a larger
        \u03b2-zone parapapillary atrophy area, a larger shift index was the only
        risk factor of OAG diagnosis in a generalized linear mixed-effects model.
        Further, a generalized estimating equation regression model revealed that
        the shift index was larger in the OAG eyes than in the control eyes for all
        ranges of axial length, while it was the smallest for the axial length of

        the center of the optic disc and Bruch''s membrane opening (BMO), as a function
        of myopia and open-angle glaucoma (OAG) subtypes. Methods In total, 118 patients
        with OAG were grouped by axial length (AL; high myopia, AL >26 mm; mild to
        moderate myopia, 24 \u2264 AL \u226426 mm; nonmyopia, AL <24 mm) and OAG subtype
        (normal-tension glaucoma [NTG], high-tension glaucoma [HTG]). The disc and
        BMO centers were determined by a merged image of red-free fundus photography
        and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The angular location of
        the RNFL defect close to the fovea (angle \u03b1) was measured from the disc
        center and BMO center, respectively (angle \u03b1disc and angle \u03b1BMO).
        The difference between angle \u03b1disc and \u03b1BMO (\u0394\u03b1), as well
        as the RNFL defect width (angle \u03b3), was evaluated. Results Angle \u03b1disc
        was smaller in myopic eyes and correlated significantly with AL (P = 0.001),
        whereas it did not differ among OAG subgroups. Angle \u03b1BMO and angle \u03b3
        were not different in the myopic and OAG subgroups. The \u0394 \u03b1 was
        larger for eyes with higher degree of myopia and had significant correlation
        with AL (P < 0.001) and was larger in NTG eyes than in HTG eyes (P = 0.023).
        Conclusions The angular location of the RNFL defect measured from the disc
        center, but not from the BMO center, was closer to the fovea for glaucomatous
        eyes with higher values of AL. The present study may facilitate understanding

        of a head-mounted display (HMD)-type virtual reality device. Methods: Healthy
        adult volunteers were examined for ocular fatigue before and after watching
        videos for 10 min with an HMD-type virtual reality device. Subjective ocular
        fatigue was measured using a questionnaire. Objective fatigue was measured
        using the critical flicker fusion frequency (CFF), high frequency component
        of accommodative microfluctuation, and accommodation amplitude. The accommodation
        amplitude was measured using the push-up method and the dynamic measurement
        mode of the autorefractometer. Changes in the spherical equivalent were also
        measured. Results: The questionnaire-based subjective ocular fatigue increased
        ( p = 0.020) after use of the HMD device. In the dominant eye, the high frequency
        component of accommodative microfluctuation increased ( p < 0.05). The accommodation
        amplitude using the push-up method was decreased in the nondominant eye (

        field defects. After a mean follow-up of 5 years, the number of bi-hemispheric
        visual field defects had increased to 34 (42%). A logistic regression analysis
        revealed that inferior deviation of vascular trunk was the only factor associated
        with initial inferior visual field defect (P = 0.001), while initial bi-hemispheric
        visual field defects were associated with worse mean deviation at initial
        visits (P<0.001). A conditional inference tree analysis showed that both the
        angular deviation (P<0.001) and initial mean deviation (P = 0.025) determined
        the initial hemispheres developing visual field defect. Conclusions Although
        both hemispheres were involved as glaucoma progression, the axons on the side
        counter to the vascular trunk deviation were damaged earlier in HTG. This
        finding implies the LC shift could add additional stress to axons exposed
        to high intraocular pressure.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

        neurodegeneration. Ubiquinol promotes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) survival
        against glaucomatous insults such as oxidative stress. Here we investigated
        the effect of ubiquinol on RGC survival and/or visual function in mouse models
        of glaucoma and oxidative stress. DBA/2J and age-matched DBA/2J-Gpnmb+ (D2-Gpnmb+),
        which do not develop intraocular pressure elevation, or C57BL/6J mice were
        fed with ubiquinol (1%) or control diet daily for 5 or 2 months. We assessed
        RGC survival by Brn3a immunohistochemistry and measured expression levels
        of active and total BAX, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma
        coactivator 1\u03b1, transcription factor A (TFAM) and oxidative phosphorylation
        (OXPHOS) complex protein. Following induction of oxidative stress by paraquat
        injection, we also assessed visual function. In glaucomatous retina, ubiquinol
        supplementation significantly promoted RGC survival, blocked BAX activation
        and increased TFAM and OXPHOS complex II protein expression. Also, ubiquinol
        supplementation ameliorated oxidative stress-induced visual dysfunction. These
        findings indicate that ubiquinol promotes RGC survival by increasing TFAM
        expression and OXPHOS complex II activity in glaucomatous neurodegeneration,
        and that ubiquinol enhances RGC survival and preserves visual function against

        Precis: The association between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and subsequent
        development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) was investigated using a nationwide,
        population-based, retrospective cohort in South Korea. POAG increases the
        risk of subsequent CKD development. Purpose: The purpose of this study was
        to investigate the risk of subsequent CKD development in patients with POAG.
        Methods: In this nationwide, population-based longitudinal cohort, 1,025,340
        beneficiaries in the 2002-2013 Korean National Health Insurance database were
        included. We identified patients with incident POAG and evaluated the risk
        of subsequent CKD development using diagnostic codes from the database after
        2-year wash-out periods. We applied time-varying covariate Cox regression
        analyses to determine the effect of POAG on the development of CKD: Model
        1 included only POAG as a time-varying covariate; Model 2 included Model 1
        and demographic information; and Model 3 included Model 2, comorbidity, comedication,
        and the Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Results: The fixed cohort included
        478,303 eligible subjects, and of these subjects, 1749 suffered incident POAG,
        and 3157 developed CKD. POAG was associated with an increased risk of CKD
        development [hazard ratio (HR)=7.63; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.89-9.87]
        in Model 1; HR=3.54 (95% CI, 2.73-4.58) in Model 2; and HR=2.90 (95% CI, 2.24-3.76)
        in Model 3]. Conclusion: POAG increased the risk of subsequent CKD in the
        general population, suggesting that POAG and CKD might share a common pathogenic

        of the central vascular trunk (CVT) and the characteristics of the optic nerve
        head (ONH) in newborns.\n\n\nMethods\nCVT position was evaluated based on
        fundus images obtained from newborns who had undergone eye-screening examinations.
        It was then graded according to the optic disc area as follows: grade 1, within
        central 4%; grade 2, within central 9%; grade 3, within central 16%; grade
        4, within central 25%; grade 5, outside central 25% of optic disc area. The
        direction of the CVT position was determined in cases of grade 2 or more as
        superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal, relative to the optic disc center.
        The ovality index and the vertical cup-to-disc ratio were determined as well.\n\n\nResults\nIn
        1000 fundus images from 1000 newborns, 87.1% showed grade 1 (95% confidence
        interval 84.7-88.8), and 10.7% showed grade 2. The most common CVT direction
        was central (87.1%, grade 1), followed by nasal (11.0%) and inferior (1.2%).
        The ovality index was 1.28 \u00b1 0.09 (range, 1.01-1.61). The ONH shape was
        vertically oval and highly uniform. The average vertical cup-to-disc ratio
        was 0.29 \u00b1 0.13 (range, 0.00-0.67).\n\n\nConclusions\nThe CVT of newborns
        was located in the central area of the ONH in most cases. The shape of the
        optic disc was vertically oval, and very similar among the newborns. Considering
        the high variability of ONH morphology and the diverse location of the CVT
        in adults, our result suggests that the shape of the ONH and the CVT position
        might change during eyeball growth.", "venue": "Investigative Ophthalmology

        1000 \u03bcM), and silica nanoparticles for 1, 2, and 3 days.\n\n\nResults\nSodium
        nitrite and SNP showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on A. castellanii
        viability. A more prominent inhibitory effect was observed with SNP (less
        than 10% of organisms survived at 7-day culture with 1000 \u03bcM) compared
        with sodium nitrite. However, more cytotoxicity on HCEC was observed with
        SNP. NO-releasing silica nanoparticles were successfully internalized into
        the amoebic cytoplasm and accumulated in large vacuoles. Although blank silica
        nanoparticles had no inhibitory effect on A. castellanii viability, NO-releasing
        silica nanoparticles showed a dose-dependent amoebicidal effect. Furthermore,
        no cystic transformation of A. castellanii was observed under a phase contrast
        microscope or transmission electron microscope after exogenous NO treatment.\n\n\nConclusions\nOur
        results demonstrated the anti-Acanthamoeba effect of exogenous NO. This finding
        suggests that NO-releasing drug platforms, including nano-carriers, can be
        a promising therapeutic strategy for Acanthamoeba keratitis.", "venue": "Investigative

        Boramae Myopia Cohort Study Report 3.", "abstract": "Purpose\nTo investigate
        changes of \u03b2-zone parapapillary atrophy (PPA) during axial elongation.\n\n\nMethods\nChange
        of \u03b2-zone PPA was evaluated by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
        (SD-OCT) in myopic children for 2 years, prospectively. Using the infrared
        images acquired by a fixed scan circle in the glaucoma progression analysis
        (GPA) mode, the retinal pigment epithelial opening (RPEO) and the clinical
        disc margin (CDM) were manually delineated. The area and position of \u03b2-zone
        PPA was calculated as the differences from those of the RPEO and CDM, respectively.
        The \u03b2-zone PPA was further differentiated into \u03b2BM PPA (\u03b2-zone
        PPA with Bruch''s membrane [BM]) and \u03b3-zone PPA (\u03b2-zone PPA without
        BM). The change of \u03b2-zone PPA was compared between the first and final
        visits.\n\n\nResults\nThe area of \u03b2-zone PPA increased in 35 eyes (76%).
        This increase was associated with RPEO area increase and CDM area decrease.
        The center of \u03b2-zone PPA moved along the direction of vascular trunk
        dragging, but to a lesser extent. The \u03b2-zone PPA enlargement was correlated
        with the extent of vascular trunk dragging (P = 0.014). In all eyes with \u03b2-zone
        PPA increase, the \u03b3-zone portion had increased. Even in childhood, \u03b2BM
        PPA existed next to their \u03b3-zone PPA in 11 eyes (24%), including 4 eyes
        that showed increase of both \u03b3-zone and \u03b2BM portion during axial
        elongation.\n\n\nConclusions\nEnlargement of \u03b2-zone PPA during axial
        elongation was affected by the extent and direction of vascular trunk dragging,
        thus implicating disproportionate growth between the retina and sclera.",

        the effect of uneventful cataract surgery on macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform
        layer (mGC-IPL) thickness in glaucoma patients. Methods. This retrospective
        study included 65 eyes of 65 subjects who underwent uneventful cataract surgery,
        including 13 glaucoma eyes and 52 normal eyes. Using spectral domain optical
        coherence tomography, the mGC-IPL thickness was measured and compared between
        glaucoma and normal eyes preoperatively as well as 1 month and 3 months postoperatively.
        Linear regression analysis was used to determine the factors associated with
        postoperative change in mGC-IPL thickness. Results. The mean mGC-IPL significantly
        increased in both groups 1 month and 3 months after surgery (all P values
        equal to or less than 0.001). The postoperative changes between groups were
        not significantly different (P = 0.171). In the multivariate regression analysis,
        preoperative mGC-IPL thickness showed a significant association with the change
        of average mGC-IPL thickness 1 month and 3 months after surgery (all P values
        < 0.001). Conclusions. The mean mGC-IPL thickness was increased after cataract
        surgery, and the postoperative mGC-IPL thickness changes were associated with
        preoperative mGC-IPL thickness in both groups and axial length in normal eye.
        The effects of cataract surgery on mean mGC-IPL thickness were not different

        To identify systemic comorbidities in patients with dry eye syndrome in South
        Korea. Methods: From 2010 to 2012, 17,364 participants aged 20 or older were
        randomly included in the nationwide Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination
        Survey V. The prevalence of dry eye syndrome and demographics of these patients
        were investigated. We performed conditional logistic regression analyses based
        on age, sex, residential area, education level, occupation type, and household
        income level to obtain the odds ratio for each systemic comorbidity among
        subjects with and without dry eye syndrome. Results: The prevalence of dry
        eye syndrome in this study was 10.4%. Age [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.02],
        female gender (AOR: 3.01), and indoor occupation (AOR: 1.30) were associated
        with a higher prevalence of dry eye syndrome and found to be less prevalent
        in those residing in rural areas (AOR: 0.73) and with lower education levels
        (AOR: 0.66\u20130.99). With regard to systemic comorbidities, dyslipidemia
        (AOR: 1.63), degenerative arthritis (AOR: 1.56), rheumatoid arthritis (AOR:
        1.44), thyroid disease (AOR: 1.79), and renal failure (AOR: 2.56) were associated
        with a significantly higher prevalence of dry eye syndrome. Conclusions: We
        found that patients with dry eye syndrome have a higher prevalence of several
        systemic comorbidities. A more comprehensive therapeutic approach considering
        the effect of systemic medication may be necessary in these patients.", "venue":

        "title": "Cross-Modal and Intra-Modal Characteristics of Visual Function and
        Speech Perception Performance in Postlingually Deafened, Cochlear Implant
        Users", "abstract": "Evidence of visual-auditory cross-modal plasticity in
        deaf individuals has been widely reported. Superior visual abilities of deaf
        individuals have been shown to result in enhanced reactivity to visual events
        and/or enhanced peripheral spatial attention. The goal of this study was to
        investigate the association between visual-auditory cross-modal plasticity
        and speech perception in post-lingually deafened, adult cochlear implant (CI)
        users. Post-lingually deafened adults with CIs (N = 14) and a group of normal
        hearing, adult controls (N = 12) participated in this study. The CI participants
        were divided into a good performer group (good CI, N = 7) and a poor performer
        group (poor CI, N = 7) based on word recognition scores. Visual evoked potentials
        (VEP) were recorded from the temporal and occipital cortex to assess reactivity.
        Visual field (VF) testing was used to assess spatial attention and Goldmann
        perimetry measures were analyzed to identify differences across groups in
        the VF. The association of the amplitude of the P1 VEP response over the right
        temporal or occipital cortex among three groups (control, good CI, poor CI)
        was analyzed. In addition, the association between VF by different stimuli
        and word perception score was evaluated. The P1 VEP amplitude recorded from
        the right temporal cortex was larger in the group of poorly performing CI
        users than the group of good performers. The P1 amplitude recorded from electrodes
        near the occipital cortex was smaller for the poor performing group. P1 VEP
        amplitude in right temporal lobe was negatively correlated with speech perception
        outcomes for the CI participants (r = -0.736, P = 0.003). However, P1 VEP
        amplitude measures recorded from near the occipital cortex had a positive
        correlation with speech perception outcome in the CI participants (r = 0.775,
        P = 0.001). In VF analysis, CI users showed narrowed central VF (VF to low
        intensity stimuli). However, their far peripheral VF (VF to high intensity
        stimuli) was not different from the controls. In addition, the extent of their
        central VF was positively correlated with speech perception outcome (r = 0.669,
        P = 0.009). Persistent visual activation in right temporal cortex even after
        CI causes negative effect on outcome in post-lingual deaf adults. We interpret
        these results to suggest that insufficient intra-modal (visual) compensation

        "Purpose: To evaluate the correlation between lamina cribrosa (LC) morphology
        and glaucoma severity in patients with primary forms of open-angle glaucoma
        (OAG) using enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
        (SD-OCT) and Humphrey visual field test (HVF). Subjects and Methods: Patients
        with OAG (n = 166), divided into normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) and high-tension
        glaucoma (HTG) groups (n = 66 and n = 100), were imaged using SD-OCT to obtain
        horizontal B-scan images of the optic nerve head (ONH). Laminar depth (LD)
        and laminar thickness (LT) were measured at the center of ONH. Results: The
        mean (\u00b1standard deviation) values of LD, LT, and visual field mean deviation
        (MD) were 555.4 \u00b1 142.3 \u03bcm, 179.9 \u00b1 49.7 \u03bcm, and \u2212
        5.7 \u00b1 6.4 dB, respectively. In the multivariate linear regression analysis,
        LD, LT, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were significantly correlated with
        MD (P = 0.007, P = 0.037, and P = 0.004, respectively). In the subgroup analyses,
        only LD was associated with MD in the NTG group (n = 66), whereas LT and IOP
        were correlated with MD in the HTG group (n = 100). Neither axial length nor
        central corneal thickness was associated with LD or LT. Conclusions: Glaucoma
        severity, as measured by HVF MD, shows significant correlations with LD and
        LT, with greater severity associated with increasing LD and decreasing LT.
        Normal- and high-tension OAG patients have different associations with LD
        and LT, which implies that the pathogenesis of these two entities might be
        different.", "venue": "Indian Journal of Ophthalmology", "year": 2016, "referenceCount":

        fixed combination (DTFC) in patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). Methods:An
        open-label, 12-week, 2-center study was conducted. Thirty-seven patients with
        treatment-na\u00efve NTG received DTFC for 12 weeks to reduce IOP. Primary
        outcome measures were changes in IOP from baseline to 12 weeks of treatment

        baseline to 12 weeks of treatment a trough drug effect and 8 hours after drug
        administration. At each visit, IOP was measured at 9 AM and then DTFC was
        administered by a hospital personnel. IOP was also measured at 11 AM and 5
        PM At week 12, the IOP was measured at 1 and 3 PM as well. Results:The IOP

        investigate the additive diagnostic role of spectral-domain optical coherence
        tomography (SD-OCT) and red-free retinal nerve fiber layer photography (RNFLP)
        in making clinical glaucoma diagnosis.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFour diagnostic combination
        sets, including the most recent image from each measurement of 196 glaucoma
        eyes (including the 44 preperimetric glaucoma eyes) and 101 healthy eyes,
        were prepared: (1) stereo disc photography and Humphrey visual field (SH),
        (2) SH and SD-OCT (SHO), (3) SH and RNFLP (SHR), and (4) SHR and SD-OCT (SHRO).
        Each randomly sorted set was serially presented at 1-month intervals to five
        glaucoma specialists who were asked to evaluate them in a subjective and independent
        manner. The specialists'' glaucoma-diagnostic performances based on the sets
        were then compared.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor each specialist, adding SD-OCT to SH
        or SHR increased the glaucoma-diagnostic sensitivity but not to a level of
        statistical significance. For one specialist, adding RNFLP to SH significantly
        increased the sensitivity. Each specialist showed a high level of specificity
        regardless of the diagnostic set. The overall sensitivity of all specialists''
        assessments was significantly increased by adding RNFLP or the combination
        of SD-OCT and RNFLP to SH (P < 0.001); however, adding SD-OCT to SH or SHR
        did not significantly increase the sensitivity. A similar relationship was
        noted also for the preperimetric glaucoma subgroup.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn contrast
        to RNFLP, SD-OCT did not significantly enhance the diagnostic accuracy of
        detecting glaucoma or even of preperimetric glaucoma. Our results suggest
        that, at least for glaucoma specialists, the additive diagnostic role of OCT

        Low Signal Strength Cases", "abstract": "Purpose To determine the lowest limit
        of signal strength that is still effective for accurate analysis of optic
        coherence tomography (OCT) values, we investigated the reproducibility of
        OCT scans by signal strength (SS). Methods A total of 668 subjects were scanned
        for measurements of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness using the Stratus
        OCT twice on the same day. The variability of overall RNFL thickness parameters
        obtained at different SS was analyzed and compared by repeated-measures of
        ANOVA and Spearman''s correlation coefficient. Values of the intraclass correlation
        coefficient (ICC) and variability (standard deviation) of RNFL thickness were
        obtained. The false positive ratio was analyzed. Results When SS was 3, the
        variability of RNFL thickness was significantly different (low ICC, high variability)
        in comparison to when SS was 4 or greater. Significant negative correlations
        were observed between variability in RNFL thickness and signal strength. The
        difference of variability of average RNFL thickness between SS 4 (4.94 \u00b5m)
        and SS 6 (4.41 \u00b5m) was 0.53 \u00b5m. Conclusions Clinically, the difference
        of variability of average RNFL thickness between SS 4 and SS 6 was quite small.
        High SS is important, however, when signal strength is low due to uncorrectable
        factors in patients in need of OCT for glaucoma and retinal disease. Our results
        suggest that SS 4 is the lowest acceptable limit of signal strength for obtaining
        reproducible scanning images.", "venue": "Korean Journal of Ophthalmology",

        width induced by phacoemulsification and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation
        in normal eyes using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT).
        Methods Forty-five eyes (45 patients) underwent AS-OCT imaging to evaluate
        anterior chamber configuration before and 2 days after phacoemulsification
        and IOL implantation. We analyzed the central ACD and angle width using different
        methods: anterior chamber angle (ACA), trabecular-iris angle (TIA), angle
        opening distance (AOD), and trabecular iris surface area (TISA) in the nasal
        and temporal quadrants. Comparison between preoperative and postoperative
        measurement was done using paired t-tests and each of the angle parameters
        was analyzed with Pearson correlation testing. Subgroup analyses according
        to the IOL and axial length were performed with a general multivariate linear
        model adjusted for age. Results Before surgery, the mean anterior chamber
        angle widths were 23.21 \u00b1 6.70\u00b0 in the nasal quadrant and 24.89
        \u00b1 7.66\u00b0 in the temporal quadrant. The mean central ACD was 2.75
        \u00b1 0.43 mm. After phacoemulsification and IOL implantation, the anterior
        chamber angle width increased significantly to 35.16 \u00b1 4.65\u00b0 in
        the nasal quadrant (p = 0.001) and 36.03 \u00b1 4.86\u00b0 in the temporal
        quadrant (p = 0.001). Also, central ACD increased to 4.14 \u00b1 0.31 mm (p
        = 0.001). AOD, TISA, and TIA increased significantly after cataract surgery
        and showed positive correlation with ACA. Conclusions After cataract surgery,
        the ACD and angle width significantly increased in eyes with cataract. AS-OCT

        and venule oxygen saturation (SO2) using a conventional fundus camera, retinal
        oximetry based on nonsimultaneous image acquisition was developed and evaluated.
        Two retinal images were sequentially acquired using a conventional fundus
        camera with two bandpass filters (568 nm: isobestic, 600 nm: nonisobestic
        wavelength), one after another, instead of a built-in green filter. The images
        were registered to compensate for the differences caused by eye movements
        during the image acquisition. Retinal SO2 was measured using two wavelength
        oximetry. To evaluate sensitivity of the proposed method, SO2 in the arterioles
        and venules before and after inhalation of 100% O2 were compared, respectively,
        in 11 healthy subjects. After inhalation of 100% O2, SO2 increased from 96.0
        \u00b1 6.0% to 98.8% \u00b1 7.1% in the arterioles (p = 0.002) and from 54.0

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo determine whether retinal nerve fiber layer defect
        (RNFLD) is associated with cerebral small vessel diseases (SVDs) and to identify
        risk factors for RNFLD.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA total of 4421 Korean subjects who
        underwent health checkups including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
        and fundus photography between January 2008 and October 2009 were included
        in this study. Co-morbid systemic diseases including hypertension, diabetes
        mellitus, and stroke or ocular diseases were evaluated using detailed questionnaires
        and medical records. Two experienced ophthalmologists assessed RNFLD on fundus
        photographs, according to the definition that describes the condition as marked
        thinning or absence of retinal nerve fiber layer bundles.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRNFLD
        was detected in 238 of 4395 eligible subjects, and the estimated prevalence
        was 5.4%. Multivariate regression analysis results showed the prevalence of
        RNFLD to be significantly higher in hypertensive subjects (odds ratio [OR],
        1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-2.34), in those with cerebral SVD
        based on MRI (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.17-2.12), and in male (OR, 1.47; 95% CI,
        1.10-1.96) and older subjects (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00-1.03). Among the cases
        of cerebral SVD, white matter lesions (WMLs) were associated with RNFLD, whereas
        lacunar infarctions were not significantly associated with it.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe
        results indicate that RNFLD may be related to the presence of cerebral SVD,
        particularly WMLs. Furthermore, being older and male and having hypertension
        increase the risk of RNFLD.", "venue": "Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual

        "Speed and ease of accelerator design is a growing need. High level programming
        languages have provided significant gains in the software world, but lag in
        the hardware realm. We present a hardware implementation of a garbage collector,
        which automates memory management, one of the major conveniences of modern
        software languages. Our garbage collector is integrated with a Haskell to
        hardware HLS flow. The collector runs concurrently with the application, using
        already-idle memory slots to do its work with little to no impact on performance.
        To achieve this, our collector exploits rapid synchronization that is straightforward
        in hardware but very difficult in software. With this synchronization, the
        collector is able to safely pop in and out of very fine pockets of idleness
        on a cycle by cycle, heap by heap basis. In most cases our collector incurred
        negligible overhead, and slowed the application only when the heaps were so
        tiny that the application was unable to proceed with its operation until the
        collector had freed more space. Our experiments further show that our concurrent
        collector performs best under an eager collection policy that collects garbage
        well-before the application exhausts the available memory. Although this eager
        strategy performs more collection operations than strictly necessary, the
        application never pauses and the collector operates entirely in the background.",

        Handshaking admits compositionality: our circuits can be connected with or

        cycle. While bounding buffer sizes can cause the system to deadlock prematurely,
        the system is guaranteed to produce the same, correct, data before then. Thus,

        variety of designs, ranging from accelerators tightly coupled with CPUs (and
        using their MMUs) to fully independent accelerators that have their own MMUs.
        We find that regardless of the CPU-accelerator communication, accelerators
        should not rely on the CPU MMU for any aspect of address translation, and
        instead must have its own, local, fully-fledged MMU. That MMU, however, can
        and should be as application-specific as the accelerator itself, as our data
        indicates that even a 100% hit rate in a small, standard L1 Translation Lookaside
        Buffer (TLB) presents a substantial accelerator performance overhead. Furthermore,
        we isolate the benefits of individual MMU components (e.g., TLBs versus page
        table walkers) and discover that their relative performance, area, and energy
        are workload dependent, with their interplay resulting in different area-optimal

        "abstract": "Previous database accelerator proposals such as the Q100 provide
        a fixed set of database operators, chosen to support a target query workload.
        Some queries may not be well-supported by a fixed accelerator, typically because
        they need more resources/operators of a particular kind than the accelerator
        provides. By Amdahl''s law, these queries become relatively more expensive
        as they are not fully accelerated. We propose a second-level accelerator,
        DB-Mesh, to take up some of this workload. DB-Mesh is an asynchronous systolic
        array that is more generic than the Q100, and can be configured to run a variety
        of operators with configurable parameters such as record widths. We demonstrate
        DB-Mesh applied to nested loops joins, an operator that is not directly supported
        on the Q100. We show that a na\u00efve implementation has the potential for
        deadlock, and show how to avoid deadlock with a careful design. We also demonstrate
        how the data flow policy used in the array influences system throughput.",

        spatial architectures composed of ensembles of autonomous fixed-ISA processing
        elements offer a compelling design point between the flexibility of an FPGA
        and the compute density of a GPU or shared-memory many-core. The design regularity
        of spatial architectures demands examination of the processing element microarchitecture
        early in the design process to optimize overall effciency.This paper considers
        the microarchitectural issues surrounding pipelining a spatial processing
        element with triggered-instruction control. We propose two new techniques
        to mitigate pipeline hazards particular to spatial accelerators and non-program-counter
        architectures, evaluating them using in-vivo performance counters from an
        FPGA prototype coupled with a rigorous VLSI power and timing estimation methodology.
        We consider the effect of modern, post-Dennard-scaling CMOS technology on
        the energy-delay tradeoffs and identify a set of microarchitectures optimal
        for both high-performance and low-power application settings. Our analysis
        reveals the effectiveness of our hazard mitigation techniques as well as the
        range of microarchitectures designers might consider when selecting a processing

        in dynamic thermal management", "abstract": "Today''s microprocessors and
        Systems-on-Chip are thermally limited. Many, therefore, employ dynamic thermal
        management (DTM) to maximize performance under a reliability constraint. Accurate
        thermal monitoring is critical as temperature underestimation can hurt reliability
        by excessively aging devices and overestimation can hurt performance by unnecessarily
        throttling computing components. Placing temperature sensors close to potential
        hotspots can help accuracy, but it is non-trivial as hotspots often form inside
        digital blocks consisting of densely placed digital cells. Large sensors can
        disrupt cell placement thereby increasing wire lengths and circuit delays.
        Furthermore, the sensor needs to operate from the same digital power grid
        as the circuit, one that can be scaled down to near-threshold regime via dynamic
        voltage scaling. Absent this ability, a separate power grid and dedicated
        supply voltage for the sensors further increases area overhead. In this paper,
        we present a sensor circuit that is compact and deeply voltage-scalable and
        can be embedded among digital cells with little disruption. Simulation results

        are detected since phases that occur at a finer granularity goes undetected

        phases using interval sizes on the order of tens, hundreds, and thousands
        of program cycles. This is in stark contrast with prior phase detection studies
        where the interval size is on the order of several thousands to millions of
        cycles. The primary goal of this study is to begin to fill a gap in the literature
        on phase detection by characterizing super fine-grained program phases and
        demonstrating an application where detection of these relatively short-lived
        phases can be instrumental. Traditional models for phase detection including
        basic block vectors and working set signatures are used to detect super fine-grained

        "title": "Fast Computational GPU Design with GT-Pin", "abstract": "As computational
        applications become common for graphics processing units, new hardware designs
        must be developed to meet the unique needs of these workloads. Performance
        simulation is an important step in appraising how well a candidate design
        will serve these needs, but unfortunately, computational GPU programs are
        so large that simulating them in detail is prohibitively slow. This work addresses
        the need to understand very large computational GPU programs in three ways.
        First, it introduces a fast tracing tool that uses binary instrumentation
        for in-depth analyses of native executions on existing architectures. Second,
        it characterizes 25 commercial and benchmark OpenCL applications, which average
        308 billion GPU instructions apiece and are by far the largest benchmarks
        that have been natively profiled at this level of detail. Third, it accelerates
        simulation of future hardware by pinpointing small subsets of OpenCL applications
        that can be simulated as representative surrogates in lieu of full-length
        programs. Our fast selection method requires no simulation itself and allows
        the user to navigate the accuracy/simulation speed trade-off space, from extremely
        accurate with reasonable speedups (35X increase in simulation speed for 0.3%
        error) to reasonably accurate with extreme speedups (223X simulation speedup
        for 3.0% error).", "venue": "IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization",

        database applications. As a proof of concept, we present the instruction set
        architecture, microarchitecture, and hardware implementation of one DPU, called
        Q100. The Q100 has a collection of heterogeneous ASIC tiles that process relational
        tables and columns quickly and energy-efficiently. The architecture uses coarse
        grained in- structions that manipulate streams of data, thereby maximizing
        pipeline and data parallelism, and minimizing the need to time multiplex the
        accelerator tiles and spill inter- mediate results to memory. This work explores
        a Q100 de- sign space of 150 configurations, selecting three for further analysis:
        a small, power-conscious implementation, a high- performance implementation,
        and a balanced design that maximizes performance per Watt. We then demonstrate
        that the power-conscious Q100 handles the TPC-H queries with three orders

        "Data partitioning is a critical operation for manipulating large datasets
        because it subdivides tasks into pieces that are more amenable to efficient
        processing. It is often the limiting factor in database performance and represents
        a significant fraction of the overall runtime of large data queries. This
        article measures the performance and energy of state-of-the-art software partitioners,
        and describes and evaluates a hardware range partitioner that further improves
        efficiency.\n The software implementation is broken into two phases, allowing
        separate analysis of the partition function computation and data shuffling
        costs. Although range partitioning is commonly thought to be more expensive
        than simpler strategies such as hash partitioning, our measurements indicate
        that careful data movement and optimization of the partition function can
        allow it to approach the throughput and energy consumption of hash or radix
        partitioning.\n For further acceleration, we describe a hardware range partitioner,
        or HARP, a streaming framework that offers a seamless execution environment
        for this and other streaming accelerators, and a detailed analysis of a 32nm
        physical design that matches the throughput of four to eight software threads

        "Modern demand for energy-efficient computation has spurred research at all
        levels of the stack, from devices to microarchitecture, operating systems,
        compilers, and languages. Unfortunately, this breadth has resulted in a disjointed
        space, with technologies at different levels of the system stack rarely compared,
        let alone coordinated. This work begins to remedy the problem, conducting
        an experimental survey of the present state of energy management across the
        stack. Focusing on settings that are exposed to software, we measure the total
        energy, average power, and execution time of 41 benchmark applications in
        220 configurations, across a total of 200,000 program executions. Some of
        the more important findings of the survey include that effective parallelization
        and compiler optimizations have the potential to save far more energy than
        Linux''s frequency tuning algorithms; that certain non-complementary energy
        strategies can undercut each other''s savings by half when combined; and that
        while the power impacts of most strategies remain constant across applications,
        the runtime impacts vary, resulting in inconsistent energy impacts.", "venue":

        "title": "Trading Functionality for Power within Applications", "abstract":
        "When operating systems and hardware manage power and energy, they must be
        conservative in order to deliver requested resources while maintaining an
        expected rate of system throughput. Application-level energy management is
        more flexible, because applications can choose to request fewer resources
        or expect less performance, effectively trading accuracy or runtime for power.
        We propose to leverage this flexibility with energy exchanges, a C++ library
        extension that allows software to dynamically react to measured power and
        energy use by reducing functionality. 1. Background and Problem Given energy\u2019s
        status as a precious commodity, many have ideas about how to police its use.
        Solutions for power and energy management abound, from hardware to the operating
        system to the virtual machine and the compiler. At the base of the stack,
        hardware has become dynamically adjustable, offering a range of supply voltages,
        operating frequencies, and sleep states. In the middle, operating systems
        tune hardware based on the measured and expected needs of applications running
        above. For example, Linux has policies to manage processor idle states and
        frequency scaling [5], power-aware scheduling algorithms have been proposed
        to schedule applications such that resource slow-downs can be made for longer
        periods or at a larger scale [4]. Such hardware and operating system adjustments
        need no application-level changes. Sometimes, this is desirable: many application
        developers cannot or will not modify their programs. However, keeping applications
        out of the energy management picture limits efficiency potentials, because
        applications have three energy control mechanisms that lower levels do not.
        First, only applications have the ability to request fewer processing and
        memory resources; hardware", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount":

        "As software scalability lags behind hardware parallelism, understanding scaling
        behavior is more important than ever. This paper demonstrates how to use Parallel
        Block Vector (PBV) profiles to measure the scaling properties of multithreaded
        programs from a new perspective: the basic block''s view. Through this lens,
        we guide users through quick and simple methods to produce high-resolution
        application scaling analyses. This method requires no manual program modification,
        new hardware, or lengthy simulations, and captures the impact of architecture,
        operating systems, threading models, and inputs. We apply these techniques
        to a set of parallel benchmarks, and, as an example, demonstrate that when
        it comes to scaling, functions in an application do not behave monolithically.",

        is a widely accepted solution for performance and energy efficient computation

        This research explores the benefits and challenges of managing memory at the

        Laying a New Foundation for IT : Computer Architecture for 2025 and Beyond",
        "abstract": "Consortium (CCC) as a \" visioning exercise \" meant to promote
        forward thinking in computer research and then bring those ideas to a funded
        program. Executive Summary Computer architecture is a foundation of society\u02bcs
        Information Technology (IT). This foundation, however, was laid in the mid-20
        th-century when resources and aspirations were tens of thousands of times
        more modest than they are today. In some ways this foundation was for a bungalow
        and now we are building skyscrapers on top of the very same foundation. Through
        decades of technology and intellectual advances in computer architecture design,
        this bungalow has been extended and built upon to fuel the exponential growth
        in the IT economy,which has spurred the wider economy and societal changes
        at large. That bungalow foundation has reached its limits, the better half
        of a decade ago. To continue to deliver performance improvements, industry
        has turned to largely evolutionary multicore designs. While this approach
        is taking us to new capability levels, it has its own limitations: much parallel
        software is unlikely to performance-scale indefinitely following Moore\u02bcs
        Law, and important applications, whole or in part, are not amenable to it.
        Thus continued ILP efficiency scaling is required. On September 20-21 a group
        of researchers met in Seattle to address one seemingly simple question: what
        now in instruction-level-parallelism (ILP) research? The consensus, articulated
        here in this report, is a broad and radical research agenda for computer architecture
        for 2025 and beyond. First, the fundamental boundary between hardware and
        software must change, as the workshop attendees believed that the necessary
        performance gains cannot be achieved through advances in conventional microarchitectures
        (Section 3). Old debates such as RISC vs. CISC, or VLIW vs. Superscalar are
        moot. Instead, we argue in this report that research questioning the very
        foundations of the execution model is required. Questions such as: Is there
        a need for the current rigid boundary between software and hardware? Do processors
        need precise state? Is the von Neumann model the right approach? Should memory
        be accessed sequentially and with no high-level knowledge of program usage?
        The answers to these questions were last settled over half a century ago under
        extremely different technological constraints: scarcity of logic resources
        versus abundance; abundance of power versus too little to power entire chips
        we could fabricate; limited software infrastructures, compared to millions
        of lines of code in complex applications; no consideration of security beyond
        a handshake, compared to \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount":

        "The hardware industry\u2019s rapid development of multicore and many core
        hardware has outpaced the software industry\u2019s transition from sequential
        to parallel programs. Most applications are still sequential, and many cores
        on parallel machines remain unused. We propose a tool that uses data-dependence
        profiling and binary rewriting to parallelize executables without access to
        source code. Our technique uses Bernstein\u2019s conditions to identify independent
        sets of basic blocks that can be executed in parallel, introducing a level
        of granularity between fine-grained instruction level and coarsegrained task
        level parallelism. We analyze dynamically generated control and data dependence
        graphs to find independent sets of basic blocks which can be parallelized.
        We then propose to parallelize these candidates using binary rewriting techniques.
        Our technique aims to demonstrate the parallelism that remains in serial application
        by exposing concrete opportunities for paral-", "venue": "", "year": 2011,

        "title": "Brick and mortar chip fabrication", "abstract": "While Moore''s
        Law has advanced the semiconductor and technology industries, it has simultaneously
        driven up the cost of engineering a chip in a modern silicon process. The
        result is that fewer and fewer chips are produced in larger and larger volumes,
        stifling hardware diversity. \nThis thesis introduces brick and mortar chips,
        which aim to obtain the benefits of Moore''s Law without the financial side
        effects. Brick and mortar chips are made from small, pre-fabricated hardware
        components (called bricks) that are bonded in a designer-specified arrangement
        to a communication backbone chip which serves as the mortar (called the I/O
        cap). \nOur research examines several aspects of this chip manufacturing system.
        We develop a family of functional bricks, demonstrating a methodology for
        developing families that make efficient use of physical computation and communication
        resources. For high-performance communication between arbitrary combinations
        of bricks we propose a polymorphic on-chip network. This network allows a
        single I/O cap to be configured to implement the ideal network for any particular
        application. We analyze a low-cost, physical component assembly technique
        called fluidic self-assembly, and find that the chip production rate is intertwined
        with the architectural design of the components. To minimize application execution
        time on these partitioned chips, we develop software partitioning and mapping
        techniques which balance communication costs against computational resource
        contention. \nWe close with a case study: an analysis of a brick and mortar
        implementation of a chip multiprocessor. Despite this being a highly latency
        sensitive design, our measurements indicate a worst case 36% average slowdown
        in application execution compared to a traditional, monolithic chip. Based
        on this, our cost analysis, and a survey of related technologies, we conclude
        that brick and mortar offers the best available performance for its price.",

        the relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the
        cancer stem cell-vascular niche complex in human retinoblastoma tissue. Methods
        Six human retinoblastoma specimens primarily enucleated for Reese-Ellsworth
        classification stage 5a were stained to detect cancer stem cell markers, including
        ABCG2 for the stem cell marker and MCM2 for the neural stem cell marker, as
        well as to detect VEGF for the angiogenic cytokine. Using immunofluorescence,
        the expression of these proteins was analyzed, and their relative locations
        noted. Results In non-neoplastic retina of tumor-bearing eyes, ABCG2 and MCM2
        were sporadically expressed in the ganglion cell layer and the inner nuclear
        layer, whereas VEGF was sporadically expressed in inner retina where retinal
        vessels are abundantly distributed. In the tumor, ABCG2 was strongly expressed
        out of Wintersteiner rosettes, whereas MCM2 and VEGF were strongly stained
        in the rosettes. Interestingly, the outer portion of the rosettes was positive
        for MCM2, and the inner portion of the rosettes was positive for VEGF. Conclusions
        Our data demonstrated that MCM2 and VEGF are strongly expressed in the rosettes
        of the tumor, which were far from the area of ABCG2-positive cells. Although
        VEGF might not directly contribute to the cancer stem cell-vascular niche
        complex, it could play some role in the differentiation of tumor cells to
        build up the rosettes.", "venue": "Korean Journal of Ophthalmology", "year":

        carriers for glaucoma treatment, may induce mild dose-dependent cytotoxicity
        but not so severe as to compromise a mammalian target of rapamycin pathway
        in immortalized trabecular meshwork cells.\n\n\nPURPOSE\nNanoparticle-based
        ophthalmic drug delivery is a promising field of drug development. In this
        study, we evaluated the effect of nonporous silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) on
        human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells.\n\n\nMETHODS\nTM cells were exposed
        to different concentrations (0 to 100\u2592\u00b5g/mL) of SiNPs (50, 100,
        and 150\u2592nm) for up to 48 hours. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
        confirmed the intracellular distribution of SiNPs. Cellular viability assay,
        reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, autophagy, and activation of the
        mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were evaluated. Histologic analysis
        of the TM structure was performed after intracameral injection of SiNPs (0.05\u2592mL
        of 200\u2592\u00b5g/mL concentration) in rabbits.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSiNPs were
        taken up by TM cells and localized in the cytoplasm. Neither nuclear entry
        nor mitochondrial damage was observed. SiNPs induced a mild but dose-dependent
        increase of lactate dehydrogenase. However, neither increase of intracellular
        ROS levels nor apoptosis was observed after SiNPs exposure. Significant co-activation
        of autophagy and the mTOR pathway was observed with exposure to SiNPs. Aqueous
        plexus structure was well maintained without inflammation in rabbits after
        SiNPs exposure.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSiNPs induce mild and dose-dependent cytotoxicity
        in TM cells. However, the toxicity level is not enough to compromise the mTOR
        pathway of TM cells and histologic structure of the aqueous plexus tissue.",
