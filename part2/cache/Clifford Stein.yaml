        "This paper describes a volume rendering system for unstructured data, especially
        finite element data, that creates images with very high accuracy. The system
        will currently handle meshes whose cells are either linear or quadratic tetrahedra.
        Compromises or approximations are not introduced for the sake of efficiency.
        Whenever possible, exact mathematical solutions for the radiance integrals
        involved and for interpolation are used. The system will also handle meshes
        with mixed cell types: tetrahedra, bricks, prisms, wedges, and pyramids, but
        not with high accuracy. Accurate semi-transparent shaded isosurfaces may be
        embedded in the volume rendering. For very small cells, subpixel accumulation
        by splatting is used to avoid sampling error. A revision to an existing accurate
        visibility ordering algorithm is described, which includes a correction and
        a method for dramatically increasing its efficiency. Finally, hardware assisted
        projection and compositing are extended from tetrahedra to arbitrary convex
        polyhedra.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics",

        for mantle dynamics", "abstract": "The viscosity of planetary mantle material
        is strongly temperature dependent. This dependence is described by an Arrhenius
        law. But for the realistic viscosity contrast that appears over the depth
        of the mantle, strong gradients in the upper thermal boundary layer occur.
        These strong gradients are not realizable in numerical models. Therefore,
        the Frank\u2010Kamenetskii approximation, leading to a linearized exponential
        viscosity function, is commonly used. Much research on the plate\u2010mantle
        system has been done applying the Frank\u2010Kamenetskii rheology. The question
        though still arises, if these results can be reproduced when using the Arrhenius
        law. Here it has to be kept in mind, that in numerical models the realistic
        viscosity contrast appearing over the mantle can neither be coped with by
        the Arrhenius nor the Frank\u2010Kamenetskii approach. Thus, the computational
        aspects to date only allow for viscosity contrasts being moderate as compared
        to realistic values and extrapolations to planet\u2010like values have to
        be made for both rheologies. Comparing results obtained by the commonly used
        forms of the Arrhenius and the Frank\u2010Kamenetskii approach, we observe
        the same change in flow behavior from mobile\u2010lid to stagnant\u2010lid
        convection. The differences are only of quantitative nature: In the stagnant\u2010lid
        regime, some Arrhenius formulations lead to a thinner top boundary layer which
        results in values of lithospheric thicknesses being more realistic. Here it
        has to be noted that different forms of the Arrhenius law have been used which
        differ among themselves. When properly scaled, the differences between the
        Frank\u2010Kamenetskii and Arrhenius rheology can, however, be strongly diminished.
        To understand general features in the plate tectonics\u2010mantle convection
        system an additional stress dependence of the viscosity has to be considered.
        The discrepancies between the various viscosity formulations are then of even
        less importance, because for an Earth\u2010like convection regime, the top
        viscosity is more strongly influenced by the stress dependence rather than
        by the temperature dependence.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount":

        "Oceanic plates are an integral part of the Earth''s mantle and thus play
        an important role in its dynamics and evolution. To allow plate behavior to
        arise naturally in numerical mantle convection models, self\u2010consistent
        plate generation methods apply a fully rheological approach (featuring a temperature\u2010,
        pressure\u2010 and stress\u2010dependent viscosity). However, due to the extreme
        local viscosity changes that the self\u2010generation of model plates entails,
        their computational requirements are demanding. Alternative plate modeling
        methods specify the existence of plates explicitly but can also obtain dynamically
        determined velocities (e.g., by employing a force\u2010balance method). Here
        we present modifications to a force\u2010balance model by utilizing a rheology\u2010dependent
        viscosity profile. Accordingly, plate viscosity and plate thickness are no
        longer prescribed by the modeler but now follow as a dynamic consequence of
        the temperature and stress dependence of the viscosity and the model''s evolution.
        We describe the new method and present benchmark results for a rheologically
        self\u2010consistent mantle convection model and the modified force\u2010balance
        plate model. Our results show that both plate modeling methods lead to the
        same system behavior for a wide range of system parameters making the new
        method a powerful tool to also achieve plate\u2010like surface motion naturally.",

        "title": "Sea floor flattening as response to plate deformations in mixed-mode
        heated self-consistent mantle convection", "abstract": "There is a longstanding
        debate about the cause of the flattening observed in sea floor bathymetry
        at old ages. The two classic models, the half space cooling model (HSCM) and
        the plate model (PM), both describe the dependence of topography, heat flow,
        and geoid on the age of the plate [1]. They are based on two-dimensional heat
        conduction and adequately describe Earth''s sea floor younger than 80 Myrs.
        At older ages the depth of the sea floor is shallower than predicted by HSCM
        [2]. Applying a self-consistent numerical model of mixedmode heated mantle
        convection, we find that the flattening of the surface topography is dynamically
        plausible and that it is controlled by the deformations of the surface plate,
        which appear with increasing heating rates. Stein et al. [3] argued that mantle
        convection tends to change from a mobile-lid to a stagnant-lid type of convection
        with increasing internal heating rate.We observe a typical surface topography
        in each of the end-member cases and in between the topography shows characteristics
        of both regimes. In the transitional interval we find that the topography
        follows a sqrt-age-dependence at young ages and starts to oscillate around
        an equilibrated level when it becomes older. This behaviour is likewise observed
        for the boundary of the plate. While HSCM adequately explains topography at
        young ages, it underestimates the values at the older ages, which positively
        deviate. The PM perfectly follows the time averaged topography for all ages,
        while the oscillations can be understand as a time-dependent deviation.",

        predictions is a recent framework that has been used to overcome pessimistic
        worst-case bounds in incomplete information settings. In the context of scheduling,
        very recent work has leveraged machine-learned predictions to design algorithms
        that achieve improved approximation ratios in settings where the processing
        times of the jobs are initially unknown. In this paper, we study the speed-robust
        scheduling problem where the speeds of the machines, instead of the processing
        times of the jobs, are unknown and augment this problem with predictions.
        Our main result is an algorithm that achieves a $\\min\\{\\eta^2(1+\\alpha),
        (2 + 2/\\alpha)\\}$ approximation, for any $\\alpha \\in (0,1)$, where $\\eta
        \\geq 1$ is the prediction error. When the predictions are accurate, this
        approximation outperforms the best known approximation for speed-robust scheduling
        without predictions of $2-1/m$, where $m$ is the number of machines, while
        simultaneously maintaining a worst-case approximation of $2 + 2/\\alpha$ even
        when the predictions are arbitrarily wrong. In addition, we obtain improved
        approximations for three special cases: equal job sizes, infinitesimal job
        sizes, and binary machine speeds. We also complement our algorithmic results
        with lower bounds. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithm against

        "title": "Estimating the Longest Increasing Subsequence in Nearly Optimal
        Time", "abstract": "Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) is a fundamental
        statistic of a sequence, and has been studied for decades. While the LIS of
        a sequence of length n can be computed exactly in time $O(n\\log n)$, the
        complexity of estimating the (length of the) LIS in sublinear time, especially
        when LIS $\\ll n$, is still open. We show that for any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$
        and $\\lambda=o(1)$, there exists a (randomized) non-adaptive algorithm that,
        given a sequence of length n with LIS $\\geq\\lambda n$, approximates the
        LIS up to a factor of $1/\\lambda^{o(1)}$ in $ n^{o(1)}/\\lambda$ time. Our
        algorithm improves upon prior work substantially in terms of both approximation
        and run-time: (i) we provide the first sub-polynomial approximation for LIS
        in sub-linear time; and (ii) our run-time complexity essentially matches the
        trivial sample complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(1/\\lambda)$, which is required
        to obtain any non-trivial approximation of the LIS. As part of our solution,
        we develop two novel ideas which may be of independent interest. First, we
        define a new Genuine-LIS problem, in which each sequence element may be either
        genuine or corrupted. In this model, the user receives unrestricted access
        to the actual sequence, but does not know a priori which elements are genuine.
        The goal is to estimate the LIS using genuine elements only, with the minimal
        number of tests for genuineness. The second idea, Precision Tree, enables
        accurate estimations for composition of general functions from \u201ccoarse\u201d
        (sub-)estimates. Precision Tree essentially generalizes classical precision
        sampling, which works only for summations. As a central tool, the Precision
        Tree is pre-processed on a set of samples, which thereafter is repeatedly
        used by multiple components of the algorithm, improving their amortized complexity.",

        "title": "Incremental Edge Orientation in Forests", "abstract": "For any forest
        $G = (V, E)$ it is possible to orient the edges $E$ so that no vertex in $V$
        has out-degree greater than $1$. This paper considers the incremental edge-orientation
        problem, in which the edges $E$ arrive over time and the algorithm must maintain
        a low-out-degree edge orientation at all times. We give an algorithm that
        maintains a maximum out-degree of $3$ while flipping at most $O(\\log \\log
        n)$ edge orientations per edge insertion, with high probability in $n$. The
        algorithm requires worst-case time $O(\\log n \\log \\log n)$ per insertion,
        and takes amortized time $O(1)$. The previous state of the art required up
        to $O(\\log n / \\log \\log n)$ edge flips per insertion. We then apply our
        edge-orientation results to the problem of dynamic Cuckoo hashing. The problem
        of designing simple families $\\mathcal{H}$ of hash functions that are compatible
        with Cuckoo hashing has received extensive attention. These families $\\mathcal{H}$
        are known to satisfy \\emph{static guarantees}, but do not come typically
        with \\emph{dynamic guarantees} for the running time of inserts and deletes.
        We show how to transform static guarantees (for $1$-associativity) into near-state-of-the-art
        dynamic guarantees (for $O(1)$-associativity) in a black-box fashion. Rather
        than relying on the family $\\mathcal{H}$ to supply randomness, as in past
        work, we instead rely on randomness within our table-maintenance algorithm.",

        "title": "Matching Drivers to Riders: A Two-Stage Robust Approach", "abstract":
        "Matching demand (riders) to supply (drivers) efficiently is a fundamental
        problem for ride-sharing platforms who need to match the riders (almost) as
        soon as the request arrives with only partial knowledge about future ride
        requests. A myopic approach that computes an optimal matching for current
        requests ignoring future uncertainty can be highly sub-optimal. In this paper,
        we consider a two-stage robust optimization framework for this matching problem
        where future demand uncertainty is modeled using a set of demand scenarios
        (specified explicitly or implicitly). The goal is to match the current request
        to drivers (in the first stage) so that the cost of first stage matching and
        the worst case cost over all scenarios for the second stage matching is minimized.
        We show that the two-stage robust matching is NP-hard under various cost functions
        and present constant approximation algorithms for different settings of our
        two-stage problem. Furthermore, we test our algorithms on real-life taxi data
        from the city of Shenzhen and show that they substantially improve upon myopic
        solutions and reduce the maximum wait time of the second-stage riders by an
        average of $30\\%$ in our experimental results.", "venue": "International

        consider virtual circuit routing protocols with an objective of minimizing
        energy in a network of components that are speed scalable, and that may be
        shut down when idle. We assume the standard model for component power: the
        power consumed by a component with load (speed) s is \\sigma + s\\alpha ,
        where \\sigma is the static power and the exponent \\alpha > 1. We obtain
        a very simple O(logk)approximation algorithm for multicommodity routing, where
        k is the number of demand pairs. This improves upon previous results by several
        logarithmic factors. The key step in our algorithm is a random sampling technique
        that we call hallucination, which is reminiscent of the sample-augment framework
        for buy-at-bulk problems, and sampling in cut-sparsification algorithms. We
        also consider the online setting of the problem, where demand pairs arrive
        over time. We show that our offline algorithm naturally extends to the online
        setting, and obtain a randomized competitive ratio of \\~ O(log k), which
        is the first nontrivial bound. The analysis of this algorithm involves the
        study of priority multicommodity flows, where edges and demand-pairs have
        priorities and each demandpair must route its flow only on edges of lower
        priority. We establish a polylogarithmic flow-cut gap for these priority flows,
        which we believe is of independent interest. Finally, we show how our technique
        can be used to achieve a randomized (O(logm), O(log m)) bicriteria competitive
        algorithm for the uniform capacitated network design problem, where m is the
        number of edges. Here, every edge has a cost ce and uniform capacity q, and
        the goal is to choose the minimum cost subgraph that can support the given
        multicommodity demand. This is the first online algorithm for this problem.
        In fact, our approach also improves prior results in the offline setting by
        several logarithmic factors.", "venue": "", "year": 2020, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Queuing Safely for Elevator Systems Amidst a Pandemic", "abstract":
        "The requirement of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic has presented
        significant challenges for high-rise buildings, which heavily rely on elevators
        for vertical transportation. In particular, the need for social distancing
        has reduced elevator capacity by by at least half and as much as two-thirds
        the normal amount. This reduction is a serious concern, as reduced elevator
        capacities cause large queues to build up in lobbies, which makes social distancing
        a challenge. The objective of this study was to propose simple interventions
        for safely managing the elevator queues that drastically reduce the waiting
        time and length of lobby queues. We use mathematical modeling, epidemiological
        principles, and simulation to design and evaluate our interventions. The key
        idea is to explicitly or implicitly group passengers that are going to the
        same floor into the same elevator as much as possible. In the Cohorting intervention,
        we attempt to find passengers going to the same floor as the first person
        in the queue. In the Queue Splitting intervention, we create a different queue
        for different groups of floors. Based on simulation studies, Cohorting and
        Queue Splitting can significantly reduce queue length and wait time, while
        also maintaining safety from viral transmission in otherwise crowded elevators,
        building lobbies, and entrances. The interventions we propose do not require
        programming the elevators, and rely on using signage and/or a queue manager
        to guide passengers.", "venue": "Social Science Research Network", "year":

        "abstract": "Many modern parallel systems, such as MapReduce, Hadoop and Spark,
        can be modeled well by the MPC model. The MPC model captures well coarse-grained
        computation on large data --- data is distributed to processors, each of which
        has a sublinear (in the input data) amount of memory and we alternate between
        rounds of computation and rounds of communication, where each machine can
        communicate an amount of data as large as the size of its memory. This model
        is stronger than the classical PRAM model, and it is an intriguing question
        to design algorithms whose running time is smaller than in the PRAM model.
        \nIn this paper, we study two fundamental problems, $2$-edge connectivity
        and $2$-vertex connectivity (biconnectivity). PRAM algorithms which run in
        $O(\\log n)$ time have been known for many years. We give algorithms using
        roughly log diameter rounds in the MPC model. Our main results are, for an
        $n$-vertex, $m$-edge graph of diameter $D$ and bi-diameter $D''$, 1) a $O(\\log
        D\\log\\log_{m/n} n)$ parallel time $2$-edge connectivity algorithm, 2) a
        $O(\\log D\\log^2\\log_{m/n}n+\\log D''\\log\\log_{m/n}n)$ parallel time biconnectivity
        algorithm, where the bi-diameter $D''$ is the largest cycle length over all
        the vertex pairs in the same biconnected component. Our results are fully
        scalable, meaning that the memory per processor can be $O(n^{\\delta})$ for
        arbitrary constant $\\delta>0$, and the total memory used is linear in the
        problem size. Our $2$-edge connectivity algorithm achieves the same parallel
        time as the connectivity algorithm of Andoni et al. (FOCS 2018). We also show
        an $\\Omega(\\log D'')$ conditional lower bound for the biconnectivity problem.",

        update-time (and thus broke the natural \u03a9(m) barrier) where m denotes
        the number of edges in the graph. This result was improved in a series of
        subsequent papers, though, the update-time remained polynomial. In particular,
        the fastest algorithm prior to our work had \u00d5 (min{\u221an, m^1/3}) update-time
        [Assadi et al. SODA''19]. Our algorithm maintains the lexicographically first
        MIS over a random order of the vertices. As a result, the same algorithm also
        maintains a 3-approximation of correlation clustering. We also show that a
        simpler variant of our algorithm can be used to maintain a random-order lexicographically
        first maximal matching in the same update-time.", "venue": "IEEE Annual Symposium

        shortest paths in undirected graphs, achieving poly(logn) depth and m poly(logn)
        work for n-nodes m-edges graphs. Although sequential algorithms with (nearly)
        optimal running time have been known for several decades, near-optimal parallel
        algorithms have turned out to be a much tougher challenge. For (1+\u03b5)-approximation,
        all prior algorithms with poly(logn) depth perform at least \u03a9(mn c )
        work for some constant c>0. Improving this long-standing upper bound obtained
        by Cohen (STOC\u201994) has been open for 25 years. We develop several new
        tools of independent interest. One of them is a new notion beyond hopsets
        \u2014 low hop emulator \u2014 a poly(logn)-approximate emulator graph in
        which every shortest path has at most O(loglogn) hops (edges). Direct applications
        of the low hop emulators are parallel algorithms for poly(logn)-approximate
        single source shortest path (SSSP), Bourgain\u2019s embedding, metric tree
        embedding, and low diameter decomposition, all with poly(logn) depth and m
        poly(logn) work. To boost the approximation ratio to (1+\u03b5), we introduce
        compressible preconditioners and apply it inside Sherman\u2019s framework

        cost flow (a.k.a., transshipment problem). Our algorithm computes a (1+\u03b5)-approximate
        uncapacitated minimum cost flow in poly(logn) depth using m poly(logn) work.

        "Often in a scheduling problem, there is uncertainty about the jobs to be
        processed. The issue of uncertainty regarding the machines has been much less
        studied. In this article, we study a scheduling environment in which jobs
        first need to be grouped into some sets before the number of machines is known,
        and then the sets need to be scheduled on machines without being separated.
        To evaluate algorithms in such an environment, we introduce the idea of an
        \u03b1-robust algorithm, one that is guaranteed to return a schedule on any
        number m of machines that is within an \u03b1 factor of the optimal schedule
        on m machine, where the optimum is not subject to the restriction that the
        sets cannot be separated. Under such environment, we give a (5\\3+\u03b5)-robust
        algorithm for scheduling on parallel machines to minimize makespan and show
        a lower bound 4\\3. For the special case when the jobs are infinitesimal,
        we give a 1.233-robust algorithm with an asymptotic lower bound of 1.207.

        processing frameworks, such as MapReduce, Hadoop, and Spark are popular systems
        for processing large amounts of data. The design of efficient algorithms in
        these frameworks is a challenging problem, as the systems both require parallelism---since
        datasets are so large that multiple machines are necessary---and limit the
        degree of parallelism---since the number of machines grows sublinearly in
        the size of the data. Although MapReduce is over a dozen years old~\\cite{dean2008mapreduce},
        many fundamental problems, such as Matrix Multiplication, 3-SUM, and All Pairs
        Shortest Paths, \nlack efficient MapReduce algorithms. We study these problems
        in the MapReduce setting. Our main contribution is to exhibit smooth trade-offs
        between the memory available on each machine, and the total number of machines
        necessary for each problem. Overall, we take the memory available to each
        machine as a parameter, and aim to minimize the number of rounds and number
        of machines. \nIn this paper, we build on the well-known MapReduce theoretical
        framework initiated by Karloff, Suri, and Vassilvitskii ~\\cite{karloff2010model}
        and give algorithms for many of these problems. The key to efficient algorithms
        in this setting lies in defining a sublinear number of large (polynomially
        sized) subproblems, that can then be solved in parallel. We give strategies
        for MapReduce-friendly partitioning, that result in new algorithms for all
        of the above problems. Specifically, we give constant round algorithms for
        the Orthogonal Vector (OV) and 3-SUM problems, and $O(\\log n)$-round algorithms
        for Matrix Multiplication, All Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), and Fast Fourier

        to contain a large matching, and which can be identified via local conditions.
        We then show how to use an EDCS to find 1.5-approximate matchings in several
        different models including Map Reduce, streaming and distributed computing.
        We can also use an EDCS to maintain a 1.5-optimal matching in a dynamic graph.

        "title": "Parallel Graph Connectivity in Log Diameter Rounds", "abstract":
        "Many modern parallel systems, such as MapReduce, Hadoop and Spark, can be
        modeled well by the MPC model. The MPC model captures well coarse-grained
        computation on large data \u2014 data is distributed to processors, each of
        which has a sublinear (in the input data) amount of memory and we alternate
        between rounds of computation and rounds of communication, where each machine
        can communicate an amount of data as large as the size of its memory. This
        model is stronger than the classical PRAM model, and it is an intriguing question
        to design algorithms whose running time is smaller than in the PRAM model.
        One fundamental graph problem is connectivity. On an undirected graph with
        n nodes and m edges, O(log n) round connectivity algorithms have been known
        for over 35 years. However, no algorithms with better complexity bounds were
        known. In this work, we give fully scalable, faster algorithms for the connectivity
        problem, by parameterizing the time complexity as a function of the diameter
        of the graph. Our main result is a O(log D log log_m/n n) time connectivity
        algorithm for diameter-d graphs, using \u0398(m) total memory. If our algorithm
        can use more memory, it can terminate in fewer rounds, and there is no lower
        bound on the memory per processor. We extend our results to related graph
        problems such as spanning forest, finding a DFS sequence, exact/approximate
        minimum spanning forest, and bottleneck spanning forest. We also show that
        achieving similar bounds for reachability in directed graphs would imply faster
        boolean matrix multiplication algorithms. We introduce several new algorithmic
        ideas. We describe a general technique called double exponential speed problem
        size reduction which roughly means that if we can use total memory n to reduce
        a problem from size n to n/k, for k=(N/n)^\u0398(1) in one phase, then we
        can solve the problem in O(loglog_N/n n) phases. In order to achieve this
        fast reduction for graph connectivity, we use a multistep algorithm. One key
        step is a carefully constructed truncated broadcasting scheme where each node
        broadcasts neighbor sets to its neighbors in a way that limits the size of
        the resulting neighbor sets. Another key step is random leader contraction,
        where we choose a smaller set of leaders than many previous works do.", "venue":

        "Often in a scheduling problem, there is uncertainty about the jobs to be
        processed. The issue of uncertainty regarding the machines has been much less
        studied. In this paper, we study a scheduling environment in which jobs first
        need to be grouped into some sets before the number of machines is known,
        and then the sets need to be scheduled on machines without being separated.
        In order to evaluate algorithms in such an environment, we introduce the idea
        of an \u03b1-robust algorithm, one which is guaranteed to return a schedule
        on any number m of machines that is within an \u03b1 factor of the optimal
        schedule on m machine, where the optimum is not subject to the restriction
        that the sets cannot be separated. Under such environment, we give a [EQUATION]-robust
        algorithm for scheduling on parallel machines to minimize makespan, and show
        a lower bound [EQUATION]. For the special case when the jobs are infinitesimal,
        we give a 1.233-robust algorithm with an asymptotic lower bound of 1.207.
        We also study a case of fair allocation, where the objective is to minimize
        the difference between the maximum and minimum machine load.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM

        "We study a fundamental model of resource allocation in which a finite number
        of resources must be assigned in an online manner to a heterogeneous stream
        of customers. The customers arrive randomly over time according to known stochastic
        processes. Each customer requires a specific amount of capacity and has a
        specific preference for each of the resources with some resources being feasible
        for the customer and some not. The system must find a feasible assignment
        of each customer to a resource or must reject the customer. The aim is to
        maximize the total expected capacity utilization of the resources over the
        horizon. This model has application in services, freight transportation, and
        online advertising. We present online algorithms with bounded competitive

        $k$-secretary problem, the goal is to select $k$ items in a randomly ordered
        input so as to maximize the expected value of a given monotone submodular
        function on the set of selected items. In this paper, we introduce a relaxation
        of this problem, which we refer to as submodular $k$-secretary problem with
        shortlists. In the proposed problem setting, the algorithm is allowed to choose
        more than $k$ items as part of a shortlist. Then, after seeing the entire
        input, the algorithm can choose a subset of size $k$ from the bigger set of
        items in the shortlist. We are interested in understanding to what extent
        this relaxation can improve the achievable competitive ratio for the submodular
        $k$-secretary problem. In particular, using an $O(k)$ shortlist, can an online
        algorithm achieve a competitive ratio close to the best achievable online
        approximation factor for this problem? We answer this question affirmatively
        by giving a polynomial time algorithm that achieves a $1-1/e-\\epsilon -O(k^{-1})$
        competitive ratio for any constant $\\epsilon > 0$, using a shortlist of size

        that our algorithm can be implemented in the streaming setting using a memory

        "abstract": "This paper investigates the task of load balancing where the
        objective function is to minimize the p-norm of loads, for p\\geq 1, in both
        static and incremental settings. We consider two closely related load balancing
        problems. In the bipartite matching problem we are given a bipartite graph
        G=(C\\cup S, E) and the goal is to assign each client c\\in C to a server
        s\\in S so that the p-norm of assignment loads on S is minimized. \nIn the
        graph orientation problem the goal is to orient (direct) the edges of a given
        undirected graph while minimizing the p-norm of the out-degrees. The graph
        orientation problem is a special case of the bipartite matching problem, but
        less complex, which leads to simpler algorithms. \n \nFor the graph orientation
        problem we show that the celebrated Chiba-Nishizeki peeling algorithm provides
        a simple linear time load balancing scheme whose output is an orientation
        that is 2-competitive, in a p-norm sense, for all p\\geq 1. For the bipartite
        matching problem we first provide an offline algorithm that computes an optimal
        assignment. We then extend this solution to the online bipartite matching
        problem with reassignments, where vertices from C arrive in an online fashion
        together with their corresponding edges, and we are allowed to reassign an
        amortized O(1) vertices from C each time a new vertex arrives. In this online
        scenario we show how to maintain a single assignment that is 8-competitive,
        in a p-norm sense, for all p\\geq 1.", "venue": "Information Technology Convergence

        "title": "Minimizing the Total Weighted Completion Time of Coflows in Datacenter
        Networks", "abstract": "Communications in datacenter jobs (such as the shuffle
        operations in MapReduce applications) often involve many parallel flows, which
        may be processed simultaneously. This highly parallel structure presents new
        scheduling challenges in optimizing job-level performance objectives in data
        centers. Chowdhury and Stoica introduced the coflow abstraction to capture
        these communication patterns, and recently Chowdhury et al. developed effective
        heuristics to schedule coflows. In this paper, we consider the problem of
        efficiently scheduling coflows with release dates so as to minimize the total
        weighted completion time, which has been shown to be strongly NP-hard. Our
        main result is the first polynomial-time deterministic approximation algorithm
        for this problem, with an approximation ratio of 67/3, and a randomized version
        of the algorithm, with a ratio of 9+16\u221a2/3. Our results use techniques
        from both combinatorial scheduling and matching theory, and rely on a clever
        grouping of coflows. We also run experiments on a Facebook trace to test the
        practical performance of several algorithms, including our deterministic algorithm.
        Our experiments suggest that simple algorithms provide effective approximations
        of the optimal, and that our deterministic algorithm has near-optimal performance.",

        "title": "A Fast Distributed Algorithm for \u03b1-Fair Packing Problems",
        "abstract": "Over the past two decades, fair resource allocation problems
        received considerable attention in a variety of application areas. While polynomial
        time distributed algorithms have been designed for max-min fair resource allocation,
        the design of distributed algorithms with convergence guarantees for the more
        general \ufffd\u2212fair allocations received little attention. In this paper,
        we study weighted \ufffd-fair packing problems, that is, the problems of maximizing
        the objective functions P j wjx 1 \ufffd j /(1 \u2212 \ufffd) when \ufffd
        6 1 and P j wj lnxj when \ufffd = 1 over linear constraints Ax \u2264 b, x
        \u2265 0, where wj are positive weights and A and b are non-negative. We consider
        the distributed computation model that was used for packing linear programs
        and network utility maximization problems. Under this model, we provide a
        distributed algorithm for general \ufffd. The algorithm uses simple local
        update rules and is stateless (namely, it allows asynchronous updates, is
        self-stabilizing, and allows incremental and local adjustments). It converges
        to approximate solutions in running times that have an inverse polynomial
        dependence on the approximation parameter \". The convergence time has polylogarithmic
        dependence on the problem size for \ufffd 6 1, and a nearly-linear dependence
        on the number of variables for \ufffd = 1. These are the best convergence
        times known for these problems.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        "This article concerns an online packet scheduling problem that arises as
        a natural model for buffer management at a network router. Packets arrive
        at a router at integer time steps, and are buffered upon arrival. Packets
        have non-negative weights and integer deadlines that are (weakly) increasing
        in their arrival times. In each integer time step, at most one packet can
        be sent. The objective is to maximize the sum of the weights of the packets
        that are sent by their deadlines. The main results include an optimal (\u03c6
        := (1 + \u221a 5)/2 \u2248 1.618)-competitive deterministic online algorithm,
        a (4/3 \u2248 1.33)-competitive randomized online algorithm against an oblivious
        adversary, and a 2-speed 1-competitive deterministic online algorithm. The
        analysis does not use a potential function explicitly, but instead modifies
        the adversary''s buffer and credits the adversary to account for these modifications.",

        in Peer-to-Peer Systems", "abstract": "Peer-to-peer file-sharing applications
        suffer from a fundamental problem of unfairness. Free-riders cause slower
        download times for others by contributing little or no upload bandwidth while
        consuming much download bandwidth. Previous attempts to address this fair
        bandwidth allocation problem suffer from slow peer discovery, inaccurate predictions
        of neighboring peers'' bandwidth allocations, underutilization of bandwidth,
        and complex parameter tuning. We present FairTorrent, a new deficit-based
        distributed algorithm that accurately rewards peers in accordance with their
        contribution. A FairTorrent peer simply uploads the next data block to a peer
        to whom it owes the most data as measured by a deficit counter. FairTorrent
        is resilient to exploitation by free-riders and strategic peers, is simple
        to implement, requires no bandwidth overallocation, no prediction of peers''
        rates, no centralized control, and no parameter tuning. We implemented FairTorrent
        in a BitTorrent client without modifications to the BitTorrent protocol and
        evaluated its performance against other widely used BitTorrent clients. Our
        results show that FairTorrent provides up to two orders of magnitude better
        fairness, up to five times better download times for contributing peers, and
        60%-100% better performance on average in live BitTorrent swarms.", "venue":

        "The vertex cover problem is a classical NP-complete problem for which the
        best worst-case approximation ratio is $2-o(1)$. In this paper, we use a collection
        of simple graph transformations, each of which guarantees an approximation
        ratio of $\\frac{3}{2}$, to find approximate vertex covers for a large collection
        of randomly generated graphs and test graphs from various sources. The graph
        reductions are extremely fast, and even though they by themselves are not
        guaranteed to find a vertex cover, we manage to find a $\\frac{3}{2}$-approximate
        vertex cover for almost every single graph in our collection. The few graphs
        that we cannot solve have specific structure: they are triangle-free, with
        a minimum degree of at least 3, a lower bound of $\\frac{n}{2}$ on the optimal
        vertex cover, and are unlikely to have a large bipartite subgraph.", "venue":

        "Peer-to-Peer file-sharing applications suffer from a fundamental problem
        of unfairness. Free-riders cause slower download times for others by contributing
        little or no upload bandwidth while consuming much download bandwidth. Previous
        attempts to address this fair bandwidth allocation problem suffer from slow
        peer discovery, inaccurate predictions of neighboring peers'' bandwidth allocations,
        underutilization of bandwidth, and complex parameter tuning. We present FairTorrent,
        a new deficit-based distributed algorithm that accurately rewards peers in
        accordance with their contribution. A FairTorrent peer simply uploads the
        next data block to a peer to whom it owes the most data as measured by a deficit
        counter. FairTorrent is resilient to exploitation by free-riders and strategic
        peers, is simple to implement, requires no bandwidth over-allocation, no prediction
        of peers'' rates, no centralized control, and no parameter tuning. We implemented
        FairTorrent in a BitTorrent client without modifications to the BitTorrent
        protocol, and evaluated its performance against other widely-used BitTorrent
        clients. Our results show that FairTorrent provides up to two orders of magnitude
        better fairness, up to five times better download times for contributing peers,
        and 60% to 100% better performance on average in live BitTorrent swarms.",

        "title": "On distributing symmetric streaming computations", "abstract": "A
        common approach for dealing with large data sets is to stream over the input
        in one pass, and perform computations using sublinear resources. For truly
        massive data sets, however, even making a single pass over the data is prohibitive.
        Therefore, streaming computations must be distribued over many machines. In
        practice, obtaining significant speedups using distributed computations has
        numerous challenges including synchronization, load balancing, overcoming
        processor failures, and data distribution. Successful Systems in practice
        such as Google''s MapReduce and Apache''s Hadoop address these problems by
        only allowing a certain class of highly distributable tasks defined by local
        computations that can be applied in any order to the input.\n The fundamental
        question that arises is: How does the class of computational tasks supported
        by these systems differ from the class for which streaming solutions exist?\n
        We introduce a simple algorithmic model for massive, unordered, distributed
        (mud) computation, as implemented by these systems. We show that in principle,
        mud algorithms are equivalent in power to symmetric streaming algorithms.
        More precisely, we show that any symmetric (order-invariant) function that
        can be computed by a steraming algorithm can also be computed by a mud algorithym,
        with comparable space and communication complexity. Our simulation uses Savitch''s
        theorem and therefore has superpolynomial time complexity. We extend our simulation
        result to some natural classes of approximate and randomized steraming algorithms.
        We also give negative results, using communication complexity arguments to
        prove that extensions to private randomness, promise problems and indeterminate
        functions are impossible. We also introduce an extension of the mud model
        to multiple keys and multiple rounds.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete

        "title": "Mitigating the Effect of Free-Riders in BitTorrent using Trusted
        Agents", "abstract": "Even though Peer-to-Peer (P2P) systems present a cost-effective
        and scalable solution to content distribution, most entertainment, media and
        software, content providers continue to rely on expensive, centralized solutions
        such as Content Delivery Networks. One of the main reasons is that the current
        P2P systems cannot guarantee reasonable performance as they depend on the
        willingness of users to contribute bandwidth. Moreover, even systems like
        BitTorrent, which employ a tit-for-tat protocol to encourage fair bandwidth
        exchange between users, are prone to free-riding (i.e. peers that do not upload).
        Our experiments on PlanetLab extend previous research [14, 12, 11] demonstrating
        that such selfish behavior can seriously degrade the performance of regular
        users in many more scenarios beyond simple free-riding: we observed an overhead
        of upto 430% for 80% of free-riding identities easily generated by a small
        set of selfish users. To mitigate the effects of selfish users, we propose
        a new P2P architecture that classifies peers with the help of a small number
        of trusted nodes that we call Trusted Auditors (TAs). TAs participate in P2P
        download like regular clients and detect free-riding identities by observing
        their neighbors\u2019 behavior. Using TAs, we can separate compliant users
        into a separate service pool resulting in better performance. Furthermore,
        we show that TAs are more effective ensuring the performance of the system
        than a mere increase in bandwidth capacity: for 80% of freeriding identities
        a single-TA system has a 6% download time overhead while without the TA and
        three times the bandwidth capacity we measure a 100% overhead.", "venue":

        "In the Internet, all information is aggregated into packets. The computers
        connected to the Internet communicate with each other by means of exchanging
        packets. All packets travel through communication links and network switches.
        If a burst of packets arrives at the same time, a network switch cannot transmit
        all of them on the fly. Inside a network switch, there are some output buffer(s).
        Arriving packets are queued in the output buffer(s), waiting to be delivered.
        \nMost current Internet switches adopt the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) buffering
        policy. Using the FIFO buffering policy, network switches send packets in
        the same order as they arrive. FIFO buffering policy cannot provide assured
        data transmission for time-critical applications or mission-critical applications
        due to unpredictable packet loss, end-to-end delay, out-of-order delivery,
        and jitter. \nIn the past ten years, there is rapid growth of network traffic
        and time-critical applications. The diversity of applications results in unpredictable
        packet flows and heterogeneous network traffic, and motivates us to study
        buffer management at the switch levels for providing better Quality of Service
        (QoS). The difficulty of achieving better QoS in the existing Internet infrastructure
        without sacrificing high resource utilization remains open. \nIn this thesis,
        we study a model in the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) QoS infrastructure,
        which is called the \"bounded-delay model\". We characterize packets by their
        deadlines by which they should be sent, and their payoffs when they are delivered
        on time. Our goal is to maximize the total value of packets sent by their
        deadlines. We design deterministic online packet scheduling algorithms for
        QoS queuing policies. We also develop novel and effective analysis techniques.
        Our algorithms perform better over existing solutions in terms of competitive
        ratio, which provides a worst-case performance guarantee for all traffic patterns.
        The ideas and approaches developed in this thesis explore the insights in
        similar online models with deadline constraints, and can be generalized and
        applied to other online scheduling problems.", "venue": "", "year": 2008,

        "While peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing is a powerful and cost-effective content
        distribution model, most paid-for digital-content providers (CPs) rely on
        direct download to deliver their content. CPs such as Apple iTunes that command
        a large base of paying users are hesitant to use a P2P model that could easily
        degrade their user base into yet another free file-sharing community. We present
        TP2, a system that makes P2P file sharing a viable delivery mechanism for
        paid digital content by providing the same security properties as the currently
        used direct-download model. TP2 introduces the novel notion of trusted auditors
        (TAs) \u2013 P2P peers that are controlled by the system operator. TAs monitor
        the behavior of other peers and help detect and prevent formation of illegal
        file-sharing clusters among the CP\u2019s user base. TAs both complement and
        exploit the strong authentication and authorization mechanisms that are used
        in TP2 to control access to content. It is important to note that TP2 does
        not attempt to solve the out-of-band file-sharing or DRM problems, which also
        exist in the direct-download systems currently in use. We analyze TP2 by modeling
        it as a novel game between misbehaving users who try to form unauthorized
        file-sharing clusters and TAs who curb the growth of such clusters. Our analysis
        shows that a small fraction of TAs is sufficient to protect the P2P system
        against unauthorized file sharing. In a system with as many as 60% of misbehaving
        users, even a small fraction of TAs can detect 99% of unauthorized cluster
        formation. We developed a simple economic model to show that even with such
        a large fraction of malicious nodes, TP2 can improve CP\u2019s profits (which
        could translate to user savings) by 62 to 122%, even while assuming conservative
        estimates of content and bandwidth costs. We implemented TP2 as a layer on
        top of BitTorrent and demonstrated experimentally using PlanetLab that our
        system provides trusted P2P file sharing with negligible performance overhead.",

        more mature, there is a realization that improving the performance of routers
        has the potential to substantially improve Internet performance in general.
        Currently, most routers forward packets in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
        However, the diversity of applications supported by modern IP-based networks
        has resulted in unpredictable packet flows, and heterogeneous network traffic.
        Thus, it is becoming more reasonable to consider differentiating between different
        types of packets, and perhaps to consider allowing packets to specify a deadline
        by which it must be processed. These issues have made buffer management at
        routers a critical issue in providing effective quality of service to the
        various applications that use the network.\n In this paper, we study an online
        problem in which each packet is described by its discrete arrival time, non-negative
        weight and discrete deadline; arriving packets are buffered for delivery and
        all packets have the same processing time. The packets arrive online, and
        our objective is to maximize the sum of weights of those packets that are
        sent by their deadlines. We describe an online deterministic algorithm with
        a competitive ratio of 1.854, improving the best previous known competitive
        ratio of 1.939 (Bartal et al. STACS 2004).\n The algorithmic framework we
        use has several interesting features. First, we do not use a potential function.
        Instead, after each step we modify the adversary''s buffer. Second, we introduce

        to the traditional goal of efficiently managing time and space, many computers
        now need to efficiently manage power usage. For example, Intel''s SpeedStep
        and AMD''s PowerNOW technologies allow the Windows XP operating system to
        dynamically change the speed of the processor to prolong battery life. In
        this setting, the operating system must not only have a job selection policy
        to determine which job to run, but also a speed scaling policy to determine
        the speed at which the job will be run. These policies must be online since
        the operating system does not in general have knowledge of the future. In
        current CMOS based processors, the speed satisfies the well known cube-root-rule,
        that the speed is approximately the cube root of the power [Mud01, BBS+00].
        Thus, in this work, we make the standard generalization that the power is
        equal to speed to some power \u03b1 \u2265 1, where one should think of \u03b1
        as being approximately 3 [YDS95, BKP04]. Energy is power integrated over time.

        "P2P file-sharing has been recognized as a powerful and efficient distribution
        model due to its ability to leverage users\u2019 upload bandwidth. However,
        companies that sell digital content on-line are hesitant to rely on P2P models
        for paid content distribution due to the free file-sharing inherent in P2P
        models. In this paper we present Aequitas, a P2P system in which users share
        paid content anonymously via a layer of intermediate nodes. We argue that
        with the extra anonymity in Aequitas, vendors could leverage P2P bandwidth
        while effectively maintaining the same level of trust towards their customers
        as in traditional models of paid content distribution. As a result, a content
        provider could reduce its infrastructure costs and subsequently lower the
        costs for the end-users. The intermediate nodes are incentivized to contribute
        their bandwidth via electronic micropayments. We also introduce techniques
        that prevent the intermediate nodes from learning the content of the files
        they help transmit. In this paper we present the design of our system, an
        analysis of its properties and an implementation and experimental evaluation.
        We quantify the value of the intermediate nodes, both in terms of efficiency
        and their effect on anonoymity. We argue in support of the economic and technological
        merits of the system.", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 25, "citationCount":

        multiprocessor scheduling", "abstract": "We present Grouped Distributed Queues
        (GDQ), the first proportional share scheduler for multiprocessor systems that
        scales well with a large number of processors and processes. GDQ uses a distributed
        queue architecture, and achieves accurate proportional fairness scheduling
        with only O(1) scheduling overhead. GDQ takes a novel approach to distributed
        queuing: instead of creating per-processor queues that need to be constantly
        balanced to achieve any measure of proportional sharing fairness, GDQ uses
        a simple grouping strategy to organize processes into groups based on similar
        processor time allocation rights, and then assigns processors to groups based
        on aggregate group shares. Group membership of processes is static, and fairness
        is achieved by dynamically migrating processors among groups. The set of processors
        working on a group use simple, low-overhead round-robin queues, while processor
        reallocation among groups is achieved using a new multiprocessor adaptation
        of Weighted Fair Queuing. By commoditizing processors and decoupling their
        allocation from process scheduling, GDQ provides, with only constant scheduling
        overhead, fairness within a constant of the ideal generalized processor sharing
        model for process weights with a fixed upper bound. We have implemented GDQ
        in Linux and measured its performance. Our experimental results show that
        GDQ has low overhead and scales well with the number of processors and processes.",

        number of user clicks on their ads) for a given budget. We model the entire

        NP-hard, we show, perhaps surprisingly, that simply randomizing between two
        uniform strategies that bid equally on all the keywordsworks well. More precisely,
        this strategy gets at least a 1-1/\u03b5 fraction of the maximum clicks possible.

        Data", "abstract": "An existing approach for dealing with massive data sets
        is to stream over the input in few passes and perform computations with sublinear
        resources. This method does not work for truly massive data where even making
        a single pass over the data with a processor is prohibitive. Successful log
        processing systems in practice such as Google''s MapReduce and Apache''s Hadoop
        use multiple machines. They efficiently perform a certain class of highly
        distributable computations defined by local computations that can be applied
        in any order to the input. \nMotivated by the success of these systems, we
        introduce a simple algorithmic model for massive, unordered, distributed (mud)
        computation. We initiate the study of understanding its computational complexity.
        Our main result is a positive one: any unordered function that can be computed
        by a streaming algorithm can also be computed with a mud algorithm, with comparable
        space and communication complexity. We extend this result to some useful classes
        of approximate and randomized streaming algorithms. We also give negative
        results, using communication complexity arguments to prove that extensions
        to private randomness, promise problems and indeterminate functions are impossible.
        \nWe believe that the line of research we introduce in this paper has the
        potential for tremendous impact. The distributed systems that motivate our
        work successfully process data at an unprecedented scale, distributed over
        hundreds or even thousands of machines, and perform hundreds of such analyses
        each day. The mud model (and its generalizations) inspire a set of complexity-theoretic
        questions that lie at their heart.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2006, "referenceCount":

        sharing provides a powerful content distribution model by leveraging users\u2019
        computing and bandwidth resources. However, companies have been reluctant
        to rely on P2P systems for paid content distribution due to their inability
        to limit the exploitation of these systems for free file sharing. We present
        TP2, a system that combines the more cost-effective and scalable distribution
        capabilities of P2P systems with a level of trust and control over content
        distribution similar to direct download content delivery networks. TP2 uses
        two key mechanisms that can be layered on top of existing P2P systems. First,
        it provides strong authentication to prevent free file sharing in the system.
        Second, it introduces a new notion of trusted auditors to detect and limit
        malicious attempts to gain information about participants in the system to
        facilitate additional out-of-band free file sharing. We analyze TP2 by modeling
        it as a novel game between malicious users who try to form free file sharing
        clusters and trusted auditors who curb the growth of such clusters. Our analysis
        shows that a small fraction of trusted auditors is sufficient to protect the
        P2P system against unauthorized file sharing. Using a simple economic model,
        we further show that TP2 provides a more cost-effective content distribution
        solution, resulting in higher profits for a content provider even in the presence
        of a large percentage of malicious users. Finally, we implemented TP2 on top
        of BitTorrent and use PlanetLab to show that our system can provide trusted
        P2P file sharing with negligible performance overhead.", "venue": "", "year":

        (LP) decoder that achieves the capacity (optimal rate) of a wide range of
        probabilistic binary communication channels. This is the first such result
        for LP decoding. More generally, as far as the authors are aware this is the
        first known polynomial-time capacity-achieving decoder with the maximum-likelihood
        (ML) certificate property---where output codewords come with a proof of optimality.
        Additionally, this result extends the capacity-achieving property of expander
        codes beyond the binary symmetric channel to a larger family of communication
        channels.Perhaps most importantly, since LP decoding performs well in practice
        on turbo codes and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes (comparable to the
        popular \"belief propagation\" algorithm), this result exhibits the power
        of a new, widely applicable \"dual witness\" technique (Feldman, Malkin, Servedio,
        Stein and Wainwright, ISIT ''04) for bounding decoder performance.For expander
        codes over an adversarial channel, we prove that LP decoding corrects a constant
        fraction of errors. To show this, we provide a new combinatorial characterization
        of error events that is of independent interest, and which we expect will
        lead to further improvements.", "venue": "ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms",

        effective management of packets at the router level. Specifically, if the
        arriving packets cannot all be stored in a buffer, or if the packets have
        deadlines by which they must be delivered, the router needs to identify the
        packets that should be dropped. In recent work, Kesselman et al. [6] propose
        a model, called <i>buffer management with bounded delay</i>, which can be
        thought of as an online scheduling problem on a single machine: packets arrive
        at a network switch and are stored in a buffer of size <i>B.</i> Each packet
        has a positive weight and a deadline, with the weight representing the value
        of transmitting the packet by its deadline. At each integer time step, exactly
        one packet can be transmitted, and the objective is to maximize the total
        weight of the transmitted packets. If <i>B</i> = \u221e, this is the online
        version of the scheduling problem 1| <i>p<inf>j</inf></i> = 1, <i>r<inf>j</inf></i>,

        Round-Robin (GR3), the first proportional share scheduler that combines accurate
        proportional fairness scheduling behavior with O(1) scheduling overhead on
        both uniprocessor and multiprocessor systems. GR3 uses a simple grouping strategy
        to organize clients into groups of similar processor allocations which can
        be more easily scheduled. Using this strategy, GR3 combines the benefits of
        low overhead round-robin execution with a novel ratio-based scheduling algorithm.
        GR3 introduces a novel frontlog mechanism and weight readjustment algorithm
        to operate effectively on multiprocessors. GR3 provides fairness within a
        constant factor of the ideal generalized processor sharing model for client
        weights with a fixed upper bound and preserves its fairness properties on
        multiprocessor systems. We have implemented GR3 in Linux and measured its
        performance. Our experimental results show that GR3 provides much lower scheduling

        "title": "On the Capacity of Secure Network Coding", "abstract": "We consider
        the problem of using a multicast network code to transmit information securely
        in the presence of a \u201cwire-tap\u201d adversary who can eavesdrop on a
        bounded number of network edges. Cai & Yeung (ISIT, 2002) gave a method to
        alter any given linear network code into a new code that is secure. However,
        their construction is in general inefficient, and requires a very large field
        size; in many cases this is much greater than the field size required by standard
        network code construction algorithms to achieve the min-cut capacity (without
        a security guarantee). In this paper we generalize and simplify the method
        of Cai & Yeung, and show that the problem of making a linear network code
        secure is equivalent to the problem of finding a linear code with certain
        generalized distance properties. We show that if we give up a small amount
        of overall capacity, then a random code achieves these properties using a
        much smaller field size \u2014 in some cases a field of constant size suffices
        \u2014 than the construction of Cai & Yeung. We add further support to this
        approach by showing that if we are not willing to give up any capacity, then
        a large field size may sometimes be required to achieve security.", "venue":

        "We show that for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes whose Tanner graphs
        have sufficient expansion, the linear programming (LP) decoder of Feldman,
        Karger, and Wainwright can correct a constant fraction of errors. A random
        graph will have sufficient expansion with high probability, and recent work
        shows that such graphs can be constructed efficiently. A key element of our
        method is the use of a dual witness: a zero-valued dual solution to the decoding
        linear program whose existence proves decoding success. We show that as long
        as no more than a certain constant fraction of the bits are flipped by the
        channel, we can find a dual witness. This new method can be used for proving
        bounds on the performance of any LP decoder, even in a probabilistic setting.
        Our result implies that the word error rate of the LP decoder decreases exponentially
        in the code length under the binary-symmetric channel (BSC). This is the first
        such error bound for LDPC codes using an analysis based on \"pseudocodewords.\"
        Recent work by Koetter and Vontobel shows that LP decoding and min-sum decoding
        of LDPC codes are closely related by the \"graph cover\" structure of their
        pseudocodewords; in their terminology, our result implies that that there
        exist families of LDPC codes where the minimum BSC pseudoweight grows linearly
        in the block length", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory",

        existence of capacities with path selection in a graph of arbitrary topology.
        In this paper we give a generic framework, which yields approximation algorithms
        that are simpler than those previously known and achieve significant improvements
        upon the approximation ratios. Our framework, with appropriate subroutines,
        applies to all optimization versions previously considered and, unlike previous
        work, treats in a unified manner directed and undirected graphs. We provide
        extensions of our algorithms which yield the best possible approximation guarantees
        for restricted sets of demand values and an associated scheduling problem.",

        "Two common objectives for evaluating a schedule are the makespan, or schedule
        length, and the average completion time. In this note, we give improved bounds
        on the existence of schedules that simultaneously optimize both criteria.
        In a scheduling problem, we are given n jobs and m machines. With each job
        j we associate a nonnegative weight wj . A schedule is an assignment of jobs
        to machines over time, and yields a completion time Cj for each job j. We
        then define the average completion time as \u2211n j=1 wjCj and the makespan
        as Cmax = maxj Cj . We use C opt max and \u2211 wjC \u2217 j to denote the
        optimal makespan and average completion time. We will give results which will
        hold for a wide variety of combinatorial scheduling problems. In particular,
        we require that valid schedules for the problem satisfy two very general conditions.
        First, if we take a valid schedule S and remove from it all jobs that complete
        after time t, the schedule remains a valid schedule for those jobs that remain.
        Second, given two valid schedules S1 and S2 for two sets J1 and J2 of jobs
        (where J1 \u2229 J2 is potentially nonempty), the composition of S1 and S2,
        obtained by appending S2 to the end of S1, and removing from S2 all jobs that
        are in J1 \u2229 J2, is a valid schedule for J1 \u222a J2. For the rest of
        this note we will make claims about \u201cany\u201d scheduling problem, and
        mean any problem that satisfies the two conditions above. In addition, if
        a schedule has Cmax \u2264 \u03b1C opt max and \u2211", "venue": "ACM-SIAM

        "title": "Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition", "abstract": "problems
        To understand the class of polynomial-time solvable problems, we must first
        have a formal notion of what a \"problem\" is. We define an abstract problem
        Q to be a binary relation on a set I of problem instances and a set S of problem
        solutions. For example, an instance for SHORTEST-PATH is a triple consisting
        of a graph and two vertices. A solution is a sequence of vertices in the graph,
        with perhaps the empty sequence denoting that no path exists. The problem
        SHORTEST-PATH itself is the relation that associates each instance of a graph
        and two vertices with a shortest path in the graph that connects the two vertices.
        Since shortest paths are not necessarily unique, a given problem instance
        may have more than one solution. This formulation of an abstract problem is
        more general than is required for our purposes. As we saw above, the theory
        of NP-completeness restricts attention to decision problems: those having
        a yes/no solution. In this case, we can view an abstract decision problem
        as a function that maps the instance set I to the solution set {0, 1}. For
        example, a decision problem related to SHORTEST-PATH is the problem PATH that
        we saw earlier. If i = G, u, v, k is an instance of the decision problem PATH,
        then PATH(i) = 1 (yes) if a shortest path from u to v has at most k edges,
        and PATH(i) = 0 (no) otherwise. Many abstract problems are not decision problems,
        but rather optimization problems, in which some value must be minimized or
        maximized. As we saw above, however, it is usually a simple matter to recast
        an optimization problem as a decision problem that is no harder. Encodings
        If a computer program is to solve an abstract problem, problem instances must
        be represented in a way that the program understands. An encoding of a set
        S of abstract objects is a mapping e from S to the set of binary strings.
        For example, we are all familiar with encoding the natural numbers N = {0,
        1, 2, 3, 4,...} as the strings {0, 1, 10, 11, 100,...}. Using this encoding,
        e(17) = 10001. Anyone who has looked at computer representations of keyboard
        characters is familiar with either the ASCII or EBCDIC codes. In the ASCII
        code, the encoding of A is 1000001. Even a compound object can be encoded
        as a binary string by combining the representations of its constituent parts.
        Polygons, graphs, functions, ordered pairs, programs-all can be encoded as
        binary strings. Thus, a computer algorithm that \"solves\" some abstract decision
        problem actually takes an encoding of a problem instance as input. We call
        a problem whose instance set is the set of binary strings a concrete problem.
        We say that an algorithm solves a concrete problem in time O(T (n)) if, when
        it is provided a problem instance i of length n = |i|, the algorithm can produce
        the solution in O(T (n)) time. A concrete problem is polynomial-time solvable,
        therefore, if there exists an algorithm to solve it in time O(n) for some
        constant k. We can now formally define the complexity class P as the set of
        concrete decision problems that are polynomial-time solvable. We can use encodings
        to map abstract problems to concrete problems. Given an abstract decision
        problem Q mapping an instance set I to {0, 1}, an encoding e : I \u2192 {0,
        1}* can be used to induce a related concrete decision problem, which we denote
        by e(Q). If the solution to an abstract-problem instance i I is Q(i) {0, 1},
        then the solution to the concreteproblem instance e(i) {0, 1}* is also Q(i).
        As a technicality, there may be some binary strings that represent no meaningful
        abstract-problem instance. For convenience, we shall assume that any such
        string is mapped arbitrarily to 0. Thus, the concrete problem produces the
        same solutions as the abstract problem on binary-string instances that represent
        the encodings of abstract-problem instances. We would like to extend the definition
        of polynomial-time solvability from concrete problems to abstract problems
        by using encodings as the bridge, but we would like the definition to be independent
        of any particular encoding. That is, the efficiency of solving a problem should
        not depend on how the problem is encoded. Unfortunately, it depends quite
        heavily on the encoding. For example, suppose that an integer k is to be provided
        as the sole input to an algorithm, and suppose that the running time of the
        algorithm is \u0398(k). If the integer k is provided in unary-a string of
        k 1''s-then the running time of the algorithm is O(n) on length-n inputs,
        which is polynomial time. If we use the more natural binary representation
        of the integer k, however, then the input length is n = \u230alg k\u230b +
        1. In this case, the running time of the algorithm is \u0398 (k) = \u0398(2),
        which is exponential in the size of the input. Thus, depending on the encoding,
        the algorithm runs in either polynomial or superpolynomial time. The encoding
        of an abstract problem is therefore quite important to our under-standing
        of polynomial time. We cannot really talk about solving an abstract problem
        without first specifying an encoding. Nevertheless, in practice, if we rule
        out \"expensive\" encodings such as unary ones, the actual encoding of a problem
        makes little difference to whether the problem can be solved in polynomial
        time. For example, representing integers in base 3 instead of binary has no
        effect on whether a problem is solvable in polynomial time, since an integer
        represented in base 3 can be converted to an integer represented in base 2
        in polynomial time. We say that a function f : {0, 1}* \u2192 {0,1}* is polynomial-time
        computable if there exists a polynomial-time algorithm A that, given any input
        x {0, 1}*, produces as output f (x). For some set I of problem instances,
        we say that two encodings e1 and e2 are polynomially related if there exist
        two polynomial-time computable functions f12 and f21 such that for any i I
        , we have f12(e1(i)) = e2(i) and f21(e2(i)) = e1(i). That is, the encoding
        e2(i) can be computed from the encoding e1(i) by a polynomial-time algorithm,
        and vice versa. If two encodings e1 and e2 of an abstract problem are polynomially
        related, whether the problem is polynomial-time solvable or not is independent
        of which encoding we use, as the following lemma shows. Lemma 34.1 Let Q be
        an abstract decision problem on an instance set I , and let e1 and e2 be polynomially
        related encodings on I . Then, e1(Q) P if and only if e2(Q) P. Proof We need
        only prove the forward direction, since the backward direction is symmetric.
        Suppose, therefore, that e1(Q) can be solved in time O(nk) for some constant
        k. Further, suppose that for any problem instance i, the encoding e1(i) can
        be computed from the encoding e2(i) in time O(n) for some constant c, where
        n = |e2(i)|. To solve problem e2(Q), on input e2(i), we first compute e1(i)
        and then run the algorithm for e1(Q) on e1(i). How long does this take? The
        conversion of encodings takes time O(n), and therefore |e1(i)| = O(n), since
        the output of a serial computer cannot be longer than its running time. Solving
        the problem on e1(i) takes time O(|e1(i)|) = O(n), which is polynomial since
        both c and k are constants. Thus, whether an abstract problem has its instances
        encoded in binary or base 3 does not affect its \"complexity,\" that is, whether
        it is polynomial-time solvable or not, but if instances are encoded in unary,
        its complexity may change. In order to be able to converse in an encoding-independent
        fashion, we shall generally assume that problem instances are encoded in any
        reasonable, concise fashion, unless we specifically say otherwise. To be precise,
        we shall assume that the encoding of an integer is polynomially related to
        its binary representation, and that the encoding of a finite set is polynomially
        related to its encoding as a list of its elements, enclosed in braces and
        separated by commas. (ASCII is one such encoding scheme.) With such a \"standard\"
        encoding in hand, we can derive reasonable encodings of other mathematical
        objects, such as tuples, graphs, and formulas. To denote the standard encoding
        of an object, we shall enclose the object in angle braces. Thus, G denotes
        the standard encoding of a graph G. As long as we implicitly use an encoding
        that is polynomially related to this standard encoding, we can talk directly
        about abstract problems without reference to any particular encoding, knowing
        that the choice of encoding has no effect on whether the abstract problem
        is polynomial-time solvable. Henceforth, we shall generally assume that all
        problem instances are binary strings encoded using the standard encoding,
        unless we explicitly specify the contrary. We shall also typically neglect
        the distinction between abstract and concrete problems. The reader should
        watch out for problems that arise in practice, however, in which a standard
        encoding is not obvious and the encoding does make a difference. A formal-language
        framework One of the convenient aspects of focusing on decision problems is
        that they make it easy to use the machinery of formal-language theory. It
        is worthwhile at this point to review some definitions from that theory. An
        alphabet \u03a3 is a finite set of symbols. A language L over \u03a3 is any
        set of strings made up of symbols from \u03a3. For example, if \u03a3 = {0,
        1}, the set L = {10, 11, 101, 111, 1011, 1101, 10001,...} is the language
        of binary representations of prime numbers. We denote the empty string by
        \u03b5, and the empty language by \u00d8. The language of all strings over
        \u03a3 is denoted \u03a3*. For example, if \u03a3 = {0, 1}, then \u03a3* =
        {\u03b5, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000,...} is the set of all binary strings.
        Every language L over \u03a3 is a subset of \u03a3*. There are a variety of
        operations on languages. Set-theoretic operations, such as union and intersection,
        follow directly from the set-theoretic definitions. We define the complement
        of L by . The concatenation of two languages L1 and L2 is the language L =
        {x1x2 : x1 L1 and x2 L2}. The closure or Kleene star of a language L is the
        language L*= {\u03b5} L L L \u00b7\u00b7\u00b7, where Lk is the language obtained
        by", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount": 2855,

        problem and network scheduling is that in the load balancing problem there
        is no overlap of communication and computation. The objective is to balance
        (either perfectly or approximately, depending on the variation of the problem)
        the number of jobs on each machine. The bounds of [1, 2] are not in terms
        of an actual lower bound but instead an existential lower bound. They can
        prove that their algorithm balances the number of jobs on each processor so
        that no two neighbors are more than d apart. Let be the average number of
        jobs in a network with edge expansion . Their algorithm will perform this
        approximate balancing in O( = ) steps where = maxi(ji ) and is referred to
        as the imbalance in the network. Further, they show that there exists a network
        with imbalance and edge expansion that requires O( = ) steps to balance. Thus,
        their algorithm is not an approximation algorithm by the usual de nition since
        the lower bound is not necessarily for the instance at hand but instead an
        existential lower bound. While their algorithms may produce a short schedule
        by load balancing, our algorithm gives a guarantee that the schedule produced
        is no more than an O(logm) factor longer than the shortest possible schedule
        for the instance given.", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 2,

        "title": "Exact and approximation algorithms for network flow and disjoint-path
        problems", "abstract": "Network flow problems form a core area of Combinatorial
        Optimization. Their significance arises both from their very large number
        of applications and their theoretical importance. This thesis focuses on efficient
        exact algorithms for network flow problems in P and on approximation algorithms
        for NP-hard variants such as disjoint paths and unsplittable flow. \nGiven
        an n-vertex, m-edge directed network G with real costs on the edges we give
        new algorithms to compute single-source shortest paths and the minimum mean
        cycle. Our algorithm is deterministic with $O(n\\sp2$ log n) expected running
        time over a large class of input distributions. This is the first strongly
        polynomial algorithm in over 35 years to improve upon some aspect of the O(nm)
        running time of the Bellman-Ford shortest-path algorithm. \nIn the single-source
        unsplittable flow problem, we are given a network G, a source vertex s and
        k commodities with sinks $t\\sb{i}$ and real-valued demands $\\rho\\sb{i},\\
        1\\leq i \\leq k$. We seek to route the demand $\\rho\\sb{i}$ of each commodity
        i along a single s-$t\\sb{i}$ flow path, so that the total flow routed across
        any edge e is bounded by the edge capacity $u\\sb{e}$. This NP-hard problem
        combines the difficulty of bin-packing with routing through an arbitrary graph
        and has many interesting and important variations. We give a generic framework,
        which yields approximation algorithms that are simpler than the previously
        known and achieve significant improvements upon the approximation ratios.
        \nIn a packing integer program, we seek a vector x of integers, which maximizes
        $c\\sp{T}{\\cdot}x$, subject to $Ax\\leq b,\\ A,\\ b,\\ c\\geq 0.$ The edge
        and vertex-disjoint path problems together with their multiple-source unsplittable
        flow generalization are NP-hard problems with a multitude of applications
        in areas such as routing, scheduling and bin packing. We explore the topic
        of approximating disjoint-path problems using polynomial-size packing integer
        programs. Motivated by the disjoint paths applications, we initiate the study
        of a class of packing integer programs, called column-restricted. We derive
        approximation algorithms for column-restricted packing integer programs that
        we believe are of independent interest.", "venue": "", "year": 1998, "referenceCount":

        on a set of machines so as to yield an efficient schedule is a basic problem
        in computer science and operations research. Most of the research on this
        problem incorporates the potentially unrealistic assumption that communication
        between the different machines is instantaneous. In this paper we remove this
        assumption and study the problem of network scheduling, where each job originates
        at some node of a network, and in order to be processed at another node must
        take the time to travel through the network to that node. \nOur main contribution
        is to give approximation algorithms and hardness proofs for fully general
        forms of the fundamental problems in network scheduling. We consider two basic
        scheduling objectives: minimizing the makespan and minimizing the average
        completion time. For the makespan, we prove small constant factor hardness-to-approximate
        and approximation results. For the average completion time, we give a log-squared
        approximation algorithm for the most general form of the problem. The techniques
        used in this approximation are fairly general and have several other applications.
        For example, we give the first nontrivial approximation algorithm to minimize
        the average weighted completion time of a set of jobs on related or unrelated

        "abstract": "We consider the problem of nonpreemptive scheduling to minimize
        average (weighted) completion time, allowing for release dates, parallel machines,
        and precedence constraints. Recent work has led to constant-factor approximations
        for this problem, based on solving a preemptive or linear programming relaxation
        and then using the solution to get an ordering on the jobs. We introduce several
        new techniques which generalize this basic paradigm. We use these ideas to
        obtain improved approximation algorithms for one-machine scheduling to minimize
        average completion time with release dates. In the process, we obtain an optimal
        randomized on-line algorithm for the same problem that beats a lower bound
        for deterministic on-line algorithms. We consider extensions to the case of
        parallel machine scheduling, and for this we introduce two new ideas: first,
        we show that a preemptive one-machine relaxation is a powerful tool for designing
        parallel machine scheduling algorithms that simultaneously produce good approximations
        and have small running times; second, we show that a non-greedy {open_quotes}rounding{close_quotes}
        of the relaxation yields better approximations than a greedy one. We also
        prove a general theorem relating the value of one-machine relaxations to that
        of the schedules obtained for the original m-machine problems. This theorem
        applies even when there are precedencemore\u00a0\u00bb constraints on the
        jobs. We apply this result to precedence graphs such as in-trees, out-trees,
        and series- parallel graphs; these are of particular interest in compiler
        applications that partly motivated our work.\u00ab\u00a0less", "venue": "ACM-SIAM

        influence of the underlying communications network by specifying that task
        migration from one processor to another takes time proportional to the distance
        between those two processors in the network. As a result, our algorithm must
        balance computational load and communication time. The algorithm is simple,
        requires no global control, and yields schedules of length at most 4.22 times
        optimal. We also give a lower bound on the performance of any distributed

        to scheduling, load balancing and virtual-circuit routing problems. In a significant
        development, Kleinberg gave recently constant-factor approximation algorithms

        "title": "A new approach to the minimum cut problem", "abstract": "This paper
        present a new approach to finding minimum cuts in undirected graphs. The fundamental
        principle is simple: the edges in a graph''s minimum cut form an extremely
        small fraction of the graph''s edges. Using this idea, we give a randomized,
        strongly polynomial algorithm that finds the minimum cut in an arbitrarily
        weighted undirected graph with high probability. The algorithm runs in <italic>O(n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt>log<supscrpt>3</supscrpt>n)</italic>
        time, a significant improvement over the previous <italic>O\u02dc(mn)</italic>
        time bounds based on maximum flows. It is simple and intuitive and uses no
        complex data structures. Our algorithm can be parallelized to run in <italic>RNC</italic>
        with <italic>n<supscrpt>2</supscrpt></italic> processors; this gives the first
        proof   that the minimum cut problem can be solved in <italic>RNC</italic>.
        The algorithm does more than find a single minimum cut; it finds all of them.\nWith
        minor modifications, our algorithm solves two other problems of interest.
        Our algorithm finds all cuts with value within a multiplicative factor of
        \u03b1 of the minimum cut''s in expected <italic>O\u02dc(n<supscrpt>2\u03b1</supscrpt>)</italic>

        "title": "Centralized and distributed algorithms for network scheduling",
        "abstract": "In this dissertation we will examine centralized and distributed
        algorithms for network scheduling. The input to the network scheduling problem
        is a network of machines and a set of independent jobs such that each job
        originates on some machine in the network. A job may be processed on the machine
        it originated or it may be moved to another machine to be processed. Unlike
        many previous parallel machine scheduling models, our model accounts for communication
        between processors. If a job is moved from one processor to another processor
        it will incur a time delay. The delay is proportional to the distance between
        the two machines in the network. Another aspect of the network scheduling
        model is that each edge has a capacity which restricts the number of jobs
        that can be passed over it in one time step. \nWe present two polynomial time
        centralized scheduling algorithms. One is for scheduling jobs optimally in
        a ring of processors with unit capacity edges. The other is for scheduling
        jobs optimally in arbitrary networks with infinite capacity edges. \nWe also
        present three distributed approximation algorithms for network scheduling.
        All three of the distributed algorithms have extremely simple control structures
        and produce schedules with lengths that are within a small factor of optimal.
        The first of these results handles infinite capacity rings. We present a 4.22-approximation
        algorithm as well as provide simulation results that suggest the algorithm
        performs better than our analysis implies. Furthermore, we give a lower bound
        on the performance of any distributed scheduling algorithm for rings with
        infinite capacity links. The next algorithm we present is a simple d-approximation
        algorithm for scheduling jobs in d-regular networks with unit capacity links.
        We also show how to improve the analysis for rings; the improved analysis
        reduces the approximation factor to 5/3. The final algorithm is also for unit
        capacity networks and is very similar to the algorithm for d-regular networks.
        We prove that this algorithm is an O(log m)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary
        m machine networks given that the optimal schedule length is sufficiently
        large.", "venue": "", "year": 1995, "referenceCount": 33, "citationCount":

        "Given a collection of strings S={s_1, ..., s_n} over an alphabet \\Sigma,
        a superstring \\alpha of S is a string containing each s_i as a substring;
        that is, for each i, 1>=i>=n, \\alpha contains a block of |s_i| consecutive
        characters that match s_i exactly. The shortest superstring problem is the
        problem of finding a superstring \\alpha of minimum length. The shortest superstring
        problem has applications in both data compression and computational biology.
        In data compression, the problem is a part of a general model of string compression
        proposed by Gallant, Maier and Storer (JCSS ''''80). Much of the recent interest
        in the problem is due to its application to DNA sequence assembly. The problem
        has been shown to be NP-hard; in fact, it was shown by Blum et al.(JACM ''''94)
        to be MAX SNP-hard. The first O(1)-approximation was also due to Blum et al.,
        who gave an algorithm that always returns a superstring no more than 3 times
        the length of an optimal solution. Several researchers have published results
        that improve on the approximation ratio; of these, the best previous result
        is our algorithm ShortString, which achieves a 2 3/4-approximation (WADS ''''95).
        We present our new algorithm, G-ShortString, which achieves a ratio of 2 2/3.
        It generalizes the ShortString algorithm, but the analysis differs substantially
        from that of ShortString. Our previous work identified classes of strings
        that have a nested periodic structure, and which must be present in the worst
        case for our algorithms. We introduced machinery to descibe these strings
        and proved strong structural properties about them. In this paper we extend
        this study to strings that exhibit a more relaxed form of the same structure,
        and we use this understanding to obtain our improved result.", "venue": "",

        "Given a collection of strings S = [s1,...,sn] over an alphabet sigma, a superstring
        alpha of S is a string containing each si as a substring, that is, for each
        i, 1 < or = i < or = n, alpha contains a block of magnitude of si consecutive
        characters that match si exactly. The shortest superstring problem is the
        problem of finding a superstring alpha of minimum length. The shortest superstring
        problem has applications in both computational biology and data compression.
        The shortest superstring problem is NP-hard (Gallant et al., 1980); in fact,
        it was recently shown to be MAX SNP-hard (Blum et al., 1994). Given the importance
        of the applications, several heuristics and approximation algorithms have
        been proposed. Constant factor approximation algorithms have been given in
        Blum et al. (1994) (factor of 3), Teng and Yao (1993) (factor of 2 8/9), Czumaj
        et al. (1994) (factor of 2 5/6), and Kosaraju et al. (1994) (factor of 2 50/63).
        Informally, the key to any algorithm for the shortest superstring problem
        is to identify sets of strings with large amounts of similarity, or overlap.
        Although the previous algorithms and their analyses have grown increasingly
        sophisticated, they reveal remarkably little about the structure of strings
        with large amounts of overlap. In this sense, they are solving a more general
        problem than the one at hand. In this paper, we study the structure of strings
        with large amounts of overlap and use our understanding to give an algorithm
        that finds a superstring whose length is no more than 2 3/4 times that of
        the optimal superstring. Our algorithm runs in O(magnitude of S + n3) time,
        which matches that of previous algorithms. We prove several interesting properties
        about short periodic strings, allowing us to answer questions of the following
        form: Given a string with some periodic structure, characterize all the possible
        periodic strings that can have a large amount of overlap with the first string.",

        Flow Problem with Applications to Routing and Finding Sparse Cuts", "abstract":
        "This paper describes new algorithms for approximately solving the concurrent
        multicommodity flow problem with uniform capacities. These algorithms are
        much faster than algorithms discovered previously. Besides being an important
        problem in its own right, the uniform-capacity concurrent flow problem has
        many interesting applications. Leighton and Rao used uniform-capacity concurrent
        flow to find an approximately \"sparsest cut\" in a graph and thereby approximately
        solve a wide variety of graph problems, including minimum feedback arc set,
        minimum cut linear arrangement, and minimum area layout. However, their method
        appeared to be impractical as it required solving a large linear program.
        This paper shows that their method might be practical by giving an $O(m^2
        \\log m)$ expected-time randomized algorithm for their concurrent flow problem
        on an $m$-edge graph. Raghavan and Thompson used uniform-capacity concurrent
        flow to solve approximately a channel width minimization problem in very large
        scale integration. An $O(k^{3/2} (m + n \\log n))$ expected-time randomized
        algorithm and an $O(k\\min{n,k} (m+n\\log n)\\log k)$ deterministic algorithm
        is given for this problem when the channel width is $\\Omega(\\log n)$, where

        "title": "Improved Algorithms for Bipartite Network Flow", "abstract": "In
        this paper, network flow algorithms for bipartite networks are studied. A
        network $G=(V,E)$ is called bipartite if its vertex set $V$ can be partitioned
        into two subsets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that all edges have one endpoint in
        $V_1$ and the other in $V_2$. Let $n=|V|$, $n_1 = |V_1|$, $n_2 = |V_2|$, $m=|E|$
        and assume without loss of generality that $n_1 \\leq n_2$. A bipartite network
        is called unbalanced if $n_1 \\ll n_2$ and balanced otherwise. (This notion
        is necessarily imprecise.) It is shown that several maximum flow algorithms
        can be substantially sped up when applied to unbalanced networks. The basic
        idea in these improvements is a two-edge push rule that allows one to \"charge\"
        most computation to vertices in $V_1$, and hence develop algorithms whose
        running times depend on $n_1$ rather than $n$. For example, it is shown that
        the two-edge push version of Goldberg and Tarjan''s FIFO preflow-push algorithm
        runs in $O(n_1 m + n_1^3)$ time and that the analogous version of Ahuja and
        Orlin''s excess scaling algorithm runs in $O(n_1 m + n_1^2 log U)$ time, where
        $U$ is the largest edge capacity. These ideas are also extended to dynamic
        tree implementations, parametric maximum flows, and minimum-cost flows.",

        "title": "A 2-3/4-Approximation Algorithm for the Shortest Superstring Problem",
        "abstract": "Given a collection of strings S={s_1,...,s_n} over an alphabet
        Sigma, a superstring alpha of S is a string containing each s_i as a substring,
        that is, for each i, 1>=i>=n, alpha contains a block of |s_i| consecutive
        characters that match s_i exactly. The shortest superstring problem is the
        problem of finding a superstring alpha of minimum length. The shortest superstring
        problem has applications in both computational biology and data compression.
        The problem is NP-hard [GallantMS80]; in fact, it was recently shown to be
        MAX SNP-hard [BlumJLTY91]. Given the importance of the applications, several
        heuristics and approximation algorithms have been proposed. Constant factor
        approximation algorithms have been given in [BlumJLTY91] (factor of 3), [TengY93]
        (factor of 2-8/9), [CzumajGPR94] (factor of 2-5/6) and [KosarajuPS94] (factor
        of 2-50/63). Informally, the key to any algorithm for the shortest superstring
        problem is to identify sets of strings with large amounts of similarity, or
        overlap. While the previous algorithms and their analyses have grown increasingly
        sophisticated, they reveal remarkably little about the structure of strings
        with large amounts of overlap. In this sense, they are solving a more general
        problem than the one at hand. In this paper, we study the structure of strings
        with large amounts of overlap and use our understanding to give an algorithm
        that finds a superstring whose length is no more than 2-3/4 times that of
        the optimal superstring. We prove several interesting properties about short
        periodic strings, allowing us to answer questions of the following form: given
        a string with some periodic structure, characterize all the possible periodic
        strings that can have a large amount of overlap with the first string.", "venue":

        problems", "abstract": "Abstract : In this thesis, we give efficient approximation
        algorithms for two classical combinatorial optimization problems: multicommodity
        flow problems and shop scheduling problem. The algorithms we develop for these
        problems yield solutions that are not necessarily optimal, but come with a
        provable performance guarantee; that is, we can guarantee that the solution
        found is within a certain percentage of the optimal solution. This type of
        algorithm is known as an approximation algorithm. Our results show that by
        allowing a small error in the solution of a problem, it is often possible
        to gain a significant reduction in the running time of an algorithm for that
        problem. In Chapter 2, we study the multicommodity flow problem. The multicommodity
        flow problem involves simultaneously shipping several different commodities
        from their respective sources to their sinks in a single network so that the
        total amount of flow going through each edge is no more than its capacity.
        Associated with each commodity is a demand, which is the amount of that commodity
        that we wish to ship. Given a multicommodity flow problem, one often wants
        to know if there is a feasible flow, i.e., if it is possible to find a flow
        that satisfies the demands and obeys the capacity constraints. More generally,
        we might wish to know the maximum percentage z such that at least z percent
        of each demand can be shipped without violating the capacity constraints.
        The latter problem is known as the concurrent flow problem. multicommodity

        "abstract": "All previously known algorithms for solving the multicommodity
        flow problem with capacities are based on linear programming. The best of
        these algorithms uses a fast matrix multiplication algorithm and takes O(k3.5n3m0.5
        log(nDU)) time for the multicommodity flow problem with integer demands and
        at least O(k2.5n2m0.5 log(n\ufffd\ufffd1DU)) time to find an approximate solution,
        where k is the number of commodities, n and m denote the number of nodes and
        edges in the network, D is the largest demand, and U is the largest edge capacity.
        As a consequence, even multicommodity flow problems with just a few commodities
        are believed to be much harder than single-commodity maximum-flow or minimum-cost
        flow problems. In this paper, we describe the first polynomial-time combinatorial
        algorithms for approximately solving the multicommodity flow problem. The
        running time of our randomized algorithm is (up to log factors) the same as
        the time needed to solve k single-commodity flow problems, thus giving the
        surprising result that approximately computing a k-commodity maximum-flow
        is not much harder than computing about k single-commodity maximum-flows in
        isolation. In fact, we prove that a (simple) k-commodity flow problem can
        be approximately solved by approximately solving O(k log2n) single-commodity
        minimum-cost flow problems. Our k-commodity algorithm runs in O (knm log4n)
        time with high probability. We also describe a deterministic algorithm that
        uses an O(k)-factor more time. Given any multicommodity flow problem as input,
        both algorithms are guaranteed to provide a feasible solution to a modified
        flow problem in which all capacities are increased by a (1 + \ufffd)-factor,
        or to provide a proof that there is no feasible solution to the original problem.
        We also describe faster approximation algorithms for multicommodity flow problems
        with a special structure, such as those that arise in \"sparsest cut\" problems

        multiplecommoditiesthrough a single network so that the total amount of ow
        on each edge is no more than the capacity of the edge. This problem can be
        expressed as a large linear program, and most known algorithms for it, both
        theoretical and practical, are linear programming algorithms designed to take
        advantage of the structure of multicommodity ow problems. The size of the
        linear programs, however, makes it prohibitively diicult to solve large multicommodity
        ow problems. In this paper, we describe and examine a multicommodity ow implementation
        based on the recent combinatorial approximation algorithm of Leighton et al.
        13]. The theory predicts that the running time of the algorithm increases
        linearly with the number of commodities. Our experiments verify this behavior.
        The theory also predicts that the running time increases as the square of
        the desired precision. Our experiments show that the running time increases
        at most this fast, and often slower. We also compare our combinatorial implementation
        against two diierent linear programming-based codes. First we compare our
        code to that of of Kennington 10], which is a network simplex code known to
        perform well on multicommodity ow problems. For many problems, our combinatorial
        algorithm outperforms this simplex-based linear programming algorithm. More
        precisely, as the number of commodities increases, the running time of our
        algorithm grows much more slowly than that of Kennington''s linear programming-based
        algorithm. Second, we compared our code to an interior point code of Karmarkar
        and Ramakrishnan. Here too, we achieved similar, but less dramatic results.

        n t r o d u c t i o n The multicommodity flow problem involves shipping several
        different commodities from their respective sources to their sinks in a single
        network with the total amount of flow going through an edge limited by its
        capacity. Here we consider the concurrent flow problem with uniform capacities,
        which is the problem of finding a multicommodity flow that minimizes the maximum
        total flow on any edge (the congestion). An important special case of the
        problem, called the unit-demand unit-capacity concurrent flow problem, arises
        when the amount of flow that needs to be shipped is the same for each commodity.
        For both versions of the problem we give algorithms that, for any positive
        e, find a solution whose congestion is no more than (1 + e) times the minimum
        congestion. Our algorithms significantly improve the time required for finding
        such approximately optimal solutions. We shall use n, m and k to denote the
        number of nodes, edges and commodities. Leighton and Rao [7] showed how to
        use the solution to a unit-capacity unit-demand concurrent fiow problem to
        find an approximate \"sparsest cut\" of a graph. As a consequence, they gave
        the first polylog-timesoptimal approximation algorithms for a wide variety
        of graph problems. The computational bottleneck of their method is solving
        a unit-capacity unit-demand concurrent flow problem with O(n) commodities.
        They appealed to linear programming techniques to show that the problem can
        be solved in polynomial time. The new approximation algorithm greatly improves
        the resulting running time. T h e o r e m 1.1 For any fixed 0 < e < 1, a (1
        + e)-factor approximation to the unit-capacity unit-demand concurrent flow
        problem can be found by a randomized algorithm in O((k + m)mlogm) time, where
        the constant depends", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of Computing", "year":

        a distributed adaptive algorithm to estimate the eigenvectors corresponding
        to the Q largest or smallest eigenvalues of the network-wide sensor signal
        covariance matrix in a wireless sensor network. The proposed algorithm recursively
        updates the eigenvector estimates without explicitly constructing the full
        covariance matrix that de\ufb01nes them, i.e., without centralizing all the
        raw sensor signal observations. By only sharing fused Q -dimensional observations,
        each node obtains estimates of (a) the node-speci\ufb01c entries of the Q
        covariance matrix eigenvectors, and (b) Q -dimensional projections of the
        full set of sensor signal observations onto the Q eigenvectors. We also explain
        how the latter can be used for, e.g., compression and reconstruction of the
        sensor signal observations based on principal component analysis (PCA), in
        which each node acts as a data sink. We describe a version of the algorithm
        for fully- connected networks, as well as for partially-connected networks.
        In the latter case, we assume that the network has been pruned to a tree topology
        to avoid cycles in the network. We provide convergence proofs, as well as
        numerical simulations to demonstrate the convergence and optimality of the
        algorithm.", "venue": "", "year": 1975, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":
