        "On microcontrollers, timer devices provide high-precision timing, but that
        precision is lost when using high-level languages without suitable abstractions
        for temporal behavior. So, for timing-sensitive applications, programmers
        resort to low-level languages like C which lack expressiveness and safety
        guarantees. Other programmers use specialized precision-timing hardware which
        is expensive and difficult to obtain. In this work, we achieve sub-microsecond
        precision from a high-level real-time programming language on the RP2040,
        a cheap, widely available microcontroller. Our work takes advantage of the
        RP2040\u2019s Programmable I/O (PIO) devices, which are cycle-accurate coprocessors
        designed for implementing hardware protocols over the RP2040\u2019s GPIO pins.
        We use the PIO devices to implement timestamp peripherals, which are input
        capture and output compare devices. We use times-tamp peripherals to mediate
        I/O from programs written in Sslang, a real-time programming language with
        deterministic concurrency. We show that timestamp peripherals help Sslang
        programs achieve the precise timing behavior prescribed by Sslang\u2019s Sparse
        Synchronous Programming model.", "venue": "", "year": 2023, "referenceCount":

        We present a C program partitioner for security-conscious applications that

        constraints (chiefly, declassification of sensitive data to select parties);
        from these annotations, we automatically determine a partition and auto-generate

        post-partition verification, which leverages translation validation to show
        that output program partitions are behaviorally equivalent to their input

        "Speed and ease of accelerator design is a growing need. High level programming
        languages have provided significant gains in the software world, but lag in
        the hardware realm. We present a hardware implementation of a garbage collector,
        which automates memory management, one of the major conveniences of modern
        software languages. Our garbage collector is integrated with a Haskell to
        hardware HLS flow. The collector runs concurrently with the application, using
        already-idle memory slots to do its work with little to no impact on performance.
        To achieve this, our collector exploits rapid synchronization that is straightforward
        in hardware but very difficult in software. With this synchronization, the
        collector is able to safely pop in and out of very fine pockets of idleness
        on a cycle by cycle, heap by heap basis. In most cases our collector incurred
        negligible overhead, and slowed the application only when the heaps were so
        tiny that the application was unable to proceed with its operation until the
        collector had freed more space. Our experiments further show that our concurrent
        collector performs best under an eager collection policy that collects garbage
        well-before the application exhausts the available memory. Although this eager

        promising solution to contend with the end of Dennard scaling and the slowdown

        standard approach. However, for some applications, we find that a programmable

        heterogeneous hardware accelerator for analytical query processing to a homogeneous
        systolic array alternative. We find that the heterogeneous and homogeneous
        accelerators are equivalent for large designs, while for small designs the

        for implementing dataflow networks as compositional hardware circuits. We

        how to faithfully implement such networks with bounded buffers and handshaking.
        Handshaking admits compositionality: our circuits can be connected with or
        without buffers, and combinational cycles arise only from a completely unbuffered
        cycle. While bounding buffer sizes can cause the system to deadlock prematurely,
        the system is guaranteed to produce the same, correct, data before then. Thus,
        unless the system deadlocks, inserting or removing buffers only affects its
        performance. We demonstrate how this enables design space to be explored.",

        "abstract": "Previous database accelerator proposals such as the Q100 provide
        a fixed set of database operators, chosen to support a target query workload.
        Some queries may not be well-supported by a fixed accelerator, typically because
        they need more resources/operators of a particular kind than the accelerator
        provides. By Amdahl''s law, these queries become relatively more expensive
        as they are not fully accelerated. We propose a second-level accelerator,
        DB-Mesh, to take up some of this workload. DB-Mesh is an asynchronous systolic
        array that is more generic than the Q100, and can be configured to run a variety
        of operators with configurable parameters such as record widths. We demonstrate
        DB-Mesh applied to nested loops joins, an operator that is not directly supported
        on the Q100. We show that a na\u00efve implementation has the potential for
        deadlock, and show how to avoid deadlock with a careful design. We also demonstrate
        how the data flow policy used in the array influences system throughput.",

        "We present a translation from programs expressed in a functional IR into
        dataflow networks as an intermediate step within a Haskell-to-Hardware compiler.
        Our networks exploit pipeline parallelism, particularly across multiple tail-recursive
        calls, via non-strict function evaluation. To handle the long-latency memory
        operations common to our target applications, we employ a latency-insensitive
        methodology that ensures arbitrary delays do not change the functionality
        of the circuit. We present empirical results comparing our networks against
        their strict counterparts, showing that non-strictness can mitigate small
        increases in memory latency and improve overall performance by up to 2\u00d7.",

        larger jump: a compiler that synthesizes hardware from behavioral functional
        specifications. Our compiler translates general Haskell programs into a restricted
        intermediate representation before applying a series of semantics-preserving
        transformations, concluding with a simple syntax-directed translation to SystemVerilog.
        Here, we present the overall framework for this compiler, focusing on the
        intermediate representations involved and our method for translating general
        recursive functions into equivalent hardware. We conclude with experimental

        programming languages are programming languages with an abstract (logical)
        notion of time: The execution of such programs is divided into discrete reaction
        steps, and in each of these reactions steps, the program reads new inputs
        and reacts by computing corresponding outputs of the considered reaction step.
        The programs are called synchronous because all outputs are computed together
        in zero time within a step and because parallel components synchronize their
        reaction steps by the semantics of the languages. For this reason, the synchronous
        composition is deterministic, which is a great advantage concerning predictability,
        verification of system design, and embedded code generation. Starting with
        the definition of the classic synchronous languages Esterel, Lustre and Signal
        in the late 1980''s, the research during the past 20 years was very fruitful
        and lead to new languages, compilation techniques, software and hardware architectures,

        "In general-purpose software applications, computation time is just a quality
        factor: faster is better. In cyber-physical systems (CPS), however, computation
        time is a correctness factor: missed deadlines for hard real-time applications,
        such as avionics and automobiles, can result in devastating, life-threatening
        consequences. Although many modern modeling languages for CPS include the
        notion of time, implementation languages such as C lack any temporal semantics.
        Consequently, models and programs for CPS are neither portable nor guaranteed
        to execute correctly on the real system; timing is merely a side effect of
        the realization of a software system on a specific hardware platform. In this
        position paper, we present the research initiative for a precision timed (PRET)
        infrastructure, consisting of languages, compilers, and microarchitectures,
        where timing is a correctness factor. In particular, the timing semantics
        in models and programs must be preserved during compilation to ensure that
        the behavior of real systems complies with models. We also outline new research

        of mechanical transformation, I show how a three-line recursive Haskell function
        (Fibonacci) can be translated into a hardware description language\u2014VHDL\u2014for
        efficient execution on an FPGA. The goal of this report is to lay the groundwork
        for a compiler that will perform these transformations automatically, hence
        the development is deliberately pedantic. 1 Transforming fib into simple tail
        recursion We begin by importing some types and a test generation library:1
        import Data.Int ( Int8 , Int32 ) import Test .QuickCheck Below is our starting
        point: a naive, recursive algorithm to compute Fibonacci numbers coded in
        Haskell. This is a terribly inefficient way to compute these numbers (an O(2n)
        algorithm instead of O(n)), but we will use it to illustrate our implementation
        strategy for recursive functions. We restrict the domains of the argument
        and result to simplify the hardware and illustrate how to mix different types
        of integers. fib :: Int8 \u2192 Int32 fib 1 = 1 fib 2 = 1 fib n = fib (n\u22121)
        + fib (n\u22122) We will build exactly one instance of a circuit for computing
        the fib function, so the two recursive calls may not be performed in parallel.
        Instead, we will schedule one before the other, followed by the addition of
        their results. To express this sequencing, we transform the code to continuation-passing
        style [1]. To each function, this adds a continuation argument k: a function
        to which the result will be passed as an argument. The result of each function
        call is passed to a continuation that represents the rest of the computation
        in which the function call appeared. fibc 1 k = k 1 fibc 2 k = k 1 fibc n
        k = fibc (n\u22121) ( \u03bb n1 \u2192 fibc (n\u22122) ( \u03bb n2 \u2192
        k (n1 + n2))) fib \u2019 n = fibc n ( \u03bb x \u2192 x) \u2217Much of this

        is a widely accepted solution for performance and energy efficient computation

        The spectrum of accelerators available today ranges from coarse-grain off-load

        This research explores the benefits and challenges of managing memory at the

        call these instructions Abstract Datatype Instructions (ADIs). This paper
        quantifies the performance and energy impact of ADIs on the instruction and

        "title": "Efficient, deterministic and deadlock-free concurrency", "abstract":
        "Concurrent programming languages are growing in importance with the advent
        of multicore systems. Two major concerns in any concurrent program are data
        races and deadlocks. Each are potentially subtle bugs that can be caused by
        nondeterministic scheduling choices in most concurrent formalisms. Unfortunately,
        traditional race and deadlock detection techniques fail on both large programs,
        and small programs with complex behaviors. \nWe believe the solution is model-based
        design, where the programmer is presented with a constrained higher-level
        language that prevents certain unwanted behavior. We present the SHIM model
        that guarantees the absence of data races by eschewing shared memory. \nThis
        dissertation provides SHIM based techniques that aid determinism\u2014models
        that guarantee determinism, compilers that generate deterministic code and
        libraries that provide deterministic constructs. Additionally, we avoid deadlocks,
        a consequence of improper synchronization. A SHIM program may deadlock if
        it violates a communication protocol. We provide efficient techniques for
        detecting and deterministically breaking deadlocks in programs that use the
        SHIM model. \nWe evaluate the efficiency of our techniques with a set of benchmarks.
        We have also extended our ideas to other languages. The ultimate goal is to
        provide deterministic deadlock-free concurrency along with efficiency. Our
        hope is that these ideas will be used in the future while designing complex
        concurrent systems.", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 134, "citationCount":

        exclusive access to shared memory locations. Unfortunately, lock operations
        are expensive, so much work has been done on optimizing their performance
        for common access patterns. One such pattern is found in networking applications,
        where there is a single thread dominating lock accesses. An important special
        case arises when a single-threaded program calls a thread-safe library that
        uses locks. An effective way to optimize the dominant-thread pattern is to
        \u201cbias\u201d the lock implementation so that accesses by the dominant
        thread have negligible overhead. We take this approach in this work: we simplify
        and generalize existing techniques for biased locks, producing a large design
        space with many trade-offs. For example, if we assume the dominant process
        acquires the lock infinitely often (a reasonable assumption for packet processing),
        it is possible to make the dominant process perform a lock operation without
        expensive fence or compare-and-swap instructions. This gives a very low overhead
        solution; we confirm its efficacy by experiments. We show how these constructions
        can be extended for lock reservation, re-reservation, and to reader-writer

        of multicore processors has made concurrent programming models mandatory.
        However, most concurrent programming models come with two major pitfalls:
        non-determinism and deadlocks. By determinism, we mean the output behavior
        of the program is independent of the scheduling choices (e.g., the operating
        system) and depends only on the input behavior. A few concurrent models provide
        deterministic behavior by providing constructs that impose additional synchronization,
        but improper or out-of-order use of these constructs leads to problems like
        deadlocks. In this paper, we argue for both determinism and deadlock-freedom.
        We propose a design of a deterministic, deadlock-free model. Any program that
        uses this model is guaranteed to produce the same output for a given input.
        Additionally, the program will never deadlock: the program will either terminate
        or run forever.", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "referenceCount": 14, "citationCount":

        is an extension of Objective Caml dedicated to the programming of reactive
        systems such as video games or simulation problems. It takes advantage of
        Objective Caml expressiveness and it introduces new constructs a la Esterel
        [5] to deal with time. ReactiveML is based on the synchronous reactive model
        [2]. In this model, time is represented as a succession of logical instants
        and the parallel composition guaranties that all processes can react at each
        instant. The strength of the model comes from both (1) the synchronous model
        [1] that ensures the reproductivity of behaviors and (2) the absence of causality
        problems that allows an easy integration in a general purpose language. The
        tool demo will present the language through the use of rmltop [3]: the ReactiveML
        counterpart of Objective Caml toplevel. This toplevel allows a programmer
        to interactively write ReactiveML programs which are typechecked, compiled
        and loaded on the fly. The user can then progressively run concurrent processes
        and observe the interactions between them. The language distribution is available

        "Hard real-time systems use worst-case execution time (WCET) estimates to
        ensure that timing requirements are met. The typical approach for obtaining
        WCET estimates is to employ static program analysis methods. While these approaches
        provide WCET bounds, they struggle to analyze programs with loops whose iteration
        counts depend on input data. Such programs mandate user-guided annotations.
        We propose a hybrid approach by augmenting static program analysis with model-checking
        to analyze such programs and derive the loop bounds automatically. In addition,
        we use model-checking to guarantee repeatable timing behaviors from segments
        of program code. Our target platform is a precision timed architecture: a
        SPARC-based architecture promising predictable and repeatable timing behaviors.
        We use CBMC and illustrate our approach on Euclidean\u2019s greatest common
        divisor algorithm (for WCET analysis) and a VGA controller (for repeatable
        timing validation). Keywords-Real-time; Worst-Case Execution Time; PrecisionTimed;

        "We consider pipelined architectures of packet processors consisting of a
        sequence of simple packet-processing modules interconnected by first-in first-out
        buffers. We propose a new model for describing their function, an automated
        synthesis technique that generates efficient hardware for them, and an algorithm
        for computing minimum buffer sizes that allow such pipelines to achieve their
        maximum throughput. Our functional model provides a level of abstraction familiar
        to a network protocol designer; in particular, it does not require knowledge
        of register-transfer-level hardware design. Our synthesis tool implements
        the specified function in a sequential circuit that processes packet data
        a word at a time. Finally, our analysis technique computes the maximum throughput
        possible from the modules and then determines the smallest buffers that can
        achieve it. Experimental results conducted on industrial-strength examples
        suggest that our techniques are practical. Our synthesis algorithm can generate
        circuits that achieve 40 Gb/s on field-programmable gate arrays, equal to
        state-of-the-art manual implementations, and our buffer-sizing algorithm has
        a practically short runtime. Together, our techniques make it easier to quickly

        nondeterministic scheduling choices that can change the function of the program.\n
        We believe the solution is model-based design, where the programmer is presented
        with a constrained higher-level language that prevents certain unwanted behavior.
        In this paper, we describe a compiler for the SHIM scheduling-independent
        concurrent language that generates code for the Cell Broadband heterogeneous
        multicore processor. The complexity of the code our compiler generates relative
        to the source illustrates how difficult it is to manually write code for the
        Cell.\n We demonstrate the efficacy of our compiler on two examples. While
        the SHIM language is (by design) not ideal for every algorithm, it works well
        for certain applications and simplifies the parallel programming process,
        especially on the Cell architecture.", "venue": "ACM Symposium on Applied

        "abstract": "Concurrent programming languages are growing in importance with
        the advent of multi-core systems. However, concurrent programs suffer from
        problems, such as data races and deadlock, absent from sequential programs.
        Unfortunately, traditional race and deadlock detection techniques fail on
        both large programs and small programs with complex behaviors.\n In this paper,
        we present a compositional deadlock detection technique for a concurrent language--SHIM--in
        which tasks run asynchronously and communicate using synchronous CSP-style
        rendezvous. Although SHIM guarantees the absence of data races, a SHIM program
        may still deadlock if the communication protocol is violated. Our previous
        work used NuSMV, a symbolic model checker, to detect deadlock in a SHIM program,
        but it did not scale well with the size of the problem. In this work, we take
        an incremental, divide-and-conquer approach to deadlock detection.\n In practice,
        we find our procedure is faster and uses less memory than the existing technique,
        especially on large programs, making our algorithm a practical part of the
        compilation chain.", "venue": "International Conference on Embedded Software",

        "title": "Transforming Cyclic Circuits Into", "abstract": "Designers and high-level
        synthesis tools can intro- duce unwanted cycles in digital circuits, and for
        certain com- binational functions, cyclic circuits that are stable and do
        not hold state are the smallest or most natural representations. Cyclic combinational
        circuits have well-defined functional behavior yet wreak havoc with most logic
        synthesis and timing tools, which require combinational logic to be acyclic.
        As such, some sort of cycle-removal step is necessary to handle these circuits
        with existing tools. We present a two-stage algorithm for transforming a combinational
        cyclic circuit into an equivalent acyclic circuit. The first part quickly
        and exactly characterizes all combinational behavior of a cyclic circuit.
        It starts by applying input patterns to each input and examining the boundary
        between gates whose outputs are and are not defined to find additional input
        patterns that make the circuit behave combinationally. It produces sets of
        assignments to inputs that together cover all combinational behav- ior. This
        can be used to report errors, as an optimization aid, or to restructure the
        circuit into an acyclic equivalent. The second stage of our algorithm does
        this restructuring by creating an acyclic circuit fragment from each of these
        assignments and assembles these fragments into an acyclic circuit that reproduces
        all the combinational behavior of the original cyclic circuit. Experiments

        "title": "Partial evaluation for code generation from domain-specific languages",
        "abstract": "Partial evaluation has been applied to compiler optimization
        and generation for decades. Most of the successful partial evaluators have
        been designed for general-purpose languages. Our observation is that domain-specific
        languages are also suitable targets for partial evaluation. The unusual computational
        models in many DSLs bring challenges as well as optimization opportunities
        to the compiler. \nTo enable aggressive optimization, partial evaluation has
        to be specialized to fit the specific paradigm of a DSL. In this dissertation,
        we present three such specialized partial evaluation techniques designed for
        specific languages that address a variety of compilation concerns. The first
        algorithm provides a low-cost solution for simulating concurrency on a single-threaded
        processor. The second enables a compiler to compile modest-sized synchronous
        programs in pieces that involve communication cycles. The third statically
        elaborates recursive function calls that enable programmers to dynamically
        create a system''s concurrent components in a convenient and algorithmic way.
        Our goal is to demonstrate the potential of partial evaluation to solve challenging
        issues in code generation for domain-specific languages. \nNaturally, we do
        not cover all DSL compilation issues. We hope our work will enlighten and
        encourage future research on the application of partial evaluation to this

        program''s behavior depend on scheduling decisions beyond its control. To
        eliminate such races, the SHIM concurrent programming language adopts deterministic
        message passing as it sole communication mechanism. We demonstrate such language
        restrictions are practical by presenting a SHIM to C-plus-Pthreads compiler
        that can produce efficient code for shared-memory multiprocessors. We present
        a parallel JPEG decoder and FFT exhibiting 3.05 and 3.3times speedups on a
        four-core processor.", "venue": "Design, Automation and Test in Europe", "year":

        "title": "Summary-based pointer analysis framework for modular bug finding",
        "abstract": "Modern society is irreversibly dependent on computers and, consequently,
        on software. However, as the complexity of programs increase, so does the
        number of defects within them. To alleviate the problem, automated techniques
        are constantly used to improve software quality. Static analysis is one such
        approach in which violations of correctness properties are searched and reported.
        Static analysis has many advantages, but it is necessarily conservative because
        it symbolically executes the program instead of using real inputs, and it
        considers all possible executions simultaneously. Being conservative often
        means issuing false alarms, or missing real program errors. \nPointer variables
        are a challenging aspect of many languages that can force static analysis
        tools to be overly conservative. It is often unclear what variables are affected
        by pointer-manipulating expressions, and aliasing between variables is one
        of the banes of program analysis. To alleviate that, a common solution is
        to allow the programmer to provide annotations such as declaring a variable
        as unaliased in a given scope, or providing special constructs such as the
        \"never-null\" pointer of Cyclone. However, programmers rarely keep these
        annotations up-to-date. \nThe solution is to provide some form of pointer
        analysis, which derives useful information about pointer variables in the
        program. An appropriate pointer analysis equips the static tool so that it
        is capable of reporting more errors without risking too many false alarms.
        \nThis dissertation proposes a methodology for pointer analysis that is specially
        tailored for \"modular bug finding.\" It presents a new analysis space for
        pointer analysis, defined by finer-grain \"dimensions of precision,\" which
        allows us to explore and evaluate a variety of different algorithms to achieve
        better trade-offs between analysis precision and efficiency. This framework
        is developed around a new abstraction for computing points-to sets, the Assign-Fetch
        Graph, that has many interesting features. Empirical evaluation shows promising
        results, as some unknown errors in well-known applications were discovered.",

        "Packet processing is an essential function of state-of-the-art network routers
        and switches. Implementing packet processors in pipelined architectures is
        a well-known, established technique, albeit different approaches have been
        proposed. \nThe design of packet processing pipelines is a delicate trade-off
        between the desire for abstract specifications, short development time, and
        design maintainability on one hand and very aggressive performance requirements
        on the other. \nThis thesis proposes a coherent design flow for packet processing
        pipelines. Like the design process itself, I start by introducing a novel
        domain-specific language that provides a high-level specification of the pipeline.
        Next, I address synthesizing this model and calculating its worst-case throughput.
        Finally, I address some specific circuit optimization issues. \nI claim, based
        on experimental results, that my proposed technique can dramatically improve
        the design process of these pipelines, while the resulting performance matches
        the expectations of hand-crafted design. \nThe considered pipelines exhibit
        a pseudo-linear topology, which can be too restrictive in the general case.
        However, especially due to its high performance, such an architecture may
        be suitable for applications outside packet processing, in which case some
        of my proposed techniques could be easily adapted. \nSince I ran my experiments
        on FPGAs, this work has an inherent bias towards that technology; however,

        "Unlike sequential software, concurrent software needs a structuring mechanism
        capable of specifying constructs such as pipelines, scatter-gather, and other
        networks. Concurrent software languages usually provide mechanisms for dynamically
        creating such structures, but this makes them difficult to analyze statically.
        In particular, it would be very convenient to be able to put bounds on the
        resources (memory, processes) required by a particular system.\n We present
        a static elaboration technique that can remove bounded recursion from concurrent
        programs, useful for tools that cannot handle recursion such as those for
        formal verification and hardware synthesis. We work with SHIM, a concurrent
        language that provides concurrent, recursive function calls that can be used
        to elegantly construct concurrent structures such as pipelines and the FFT.\n
        Our technique first slices the program from every recursive call to determine
        which variables control the recursion, then perform a simulation of the program
        with respect to those variables, performing constant propagation to produce
        simplified code without recursion. Experimental results suggest our slicing
        procedure is effective at selecting just those variables that participate

        For efficiency, we build a summary for each procedure that assumes distinct

        "title": "Transforming Cyclic Circuits Into Acyclic Equivalents", "abstract":
        "Designers and high-level synthesis tools can introduce unwanted cycles in
        digital circuits, and for certain combinational functions, cyclic circuits
        that are stable and do not hold state are the smallest or most natural representations.
        Cyclic combinational circuits have well-defined functional behavior yet wreak
        havoc with most logic synthesis and timing tools, which require combinational
        logic to be acyclic. As such, some sort of cycle-removal step is necessary
        to handle these circuits with existing tools. We present a two-stage algorithm
        for transforming a combinational cyclic circuit into an equivalent acyclic
        circuit. The first part quickly and exactly characterizes all combinational
        behavior of a cyclic circuit. It starts by applying input patterns to each
        input and examining the boundary between gates whose outputs are and are not
        defined to find additional input patterns that make the circuit behave combinationally.
        It produces sets of assignments to inputs that together cover all combinational
        behavior. This can be used to report errors, as an optimization aid, or to
        restructure the circuit into an acyclic equivalent. The second stage of our
        algorithm does this restructuring by creating an acyclic circuit fragment
        from each of these assignments and assembles these fragments into an acyclic
        circuit that reproduces all the combinational behavior of the original cyclic
        circuit. Experiments show that our algorithm runs in seconds on real-life
        cyclic circuits, making it useful in practice.", "venue": "IEEE Transactions

        "title": "Static Deadlock Detection for the SHIM Concurrent Language", "abstract":
        "Concurrent programming languages are becoming mandatory with the advent of
        multi-core processors. Two major concerns in any concurrent program are data
        races and deadlocks. Each are potentially subtle bugs that can be caused by
        non-deterministic scheduling choices in most concurrent formalisms. As an
        alternative, the SHIM concurrent language guarantees the absence of data races
        by eschewing shared memory, but a SHIM program may still deadlock if a program
        violates a communication protocol. We present a model-checking-based static
        deadlock detection technique for the SHIM language. Although SHIM is asynchronous,
        its semantics allow us to model it synchronously without losing precision,
        greatly reducing the state space that must be explored. This plus the obvious
        division between control and data in SHIM programs makes it easy to construct
        concise abstractions. Experimentally, we find our procedure runs in only a
        few seconds for modest-sized programs, making it practical to use as part

        "title": "{sets} -- A lightweight constraint programming language based on
        ROBDDs", "abstract": "Constraint programming is a step toward ideal programming:
        you merely define the problem domain and the constraints the solution must
        meet and let the computer do the rest. Many constraint programming languages
        have been developed; the majority of them employ iterative constraint propagation
        over the problem variables. While such an approach solves many problems and
        can handle very rich data types, it is often too inefficient to be practical.
        To address this problem, we developed a constraint programming language called
        {sets} that uses reduced ordered binary decision diagrams (ROBDDs) as the
        solution engine. Providing a minimal syntax, the language can be used to solve
        many finite problems that fit the constraint programming paradigm. The minimal
        syntax and simple semantics of the language enable the user to create libraries
        customized for a specific problem domain. {sets} is particularly useful in
        problems where an efficient search algorithm yet know to exist or can not
        be developed due to time constraints. As long as the solution domain is finite
        and discrete, {sets} should be able to describe the problem and search for
        a solution. We describe the {sets} language through a series of examples,
        show how it is compiled into C++ code that uses a public-domain ROBDD library,
        and compare the performance of this language with other constraint languages.",

        "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation with physical
        processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical
        processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations
        and vice versa. In the physical world, the passage of time is inexorable and
        concurrency is intrinsic. Neither of these properties is present in today\u2019s
        computing and networking abstractions. As a consequence, these abstractions
        require some fundamental rethinking. It is tempting to believe that the CPS
        problems can be solved by overlaying higher-level abstractions on top of existing
        computing technology. Indeed, it would be a scary prospect to suggest that
        much of the foundation of existing technology is flawed and must be rebuilt.
        How could this possibly result in a practical research program that will see
        results in our lifetime? In this position paper, we make a case that core
        computing abstractions must be and can be effectively and practically rebuilt.
        The objective is to enable a new generation of cyberphysical systems where
        computation and physical processes are tightly intertwined. This requires
        re-introducing properties that were deliberately and systematically abstracted
        away in the 20-th century view of computation. We approach the problem bottom-up.

        that are both more precise and more quickly computed. Our abstraction also
        facilitates incremental summary-based pointer analysis, which is not generally

        certain steps in updating pointer graphs and computing procedure summaries.
        For efficiency and compactness, we build a single summary for each procedure
        under the optimistic assumption that distinct pointers from the environment
        are not aliased. We restore soundness when the summary is used in a context
        with aliases. We present some results of the practical impact of our technique.",

        pipelines\u2014such as a packet processing pipeline in a network device\u2014are

        to their complex sequential behavior, the worst case throughput, as well as
        the size of the interconnecting FIFOs, are currently designed using very rough
        heuristics. Such systems are usually validated by simulation, or worse, field
        testing. In this paper, we propose a methodology that address these two issues.
        First, we propose a fast technique for computing the maximum possible throughput
        assuming unbounded FIFOs. Then, we describe two algorithms, one exact, one
        heuristic, that compute minimum FIFO sizes that can achieve this throughput
        (i.e., FIFOs that do not introduce bottlenecks). Experimental results suggest
        our algorithm is applicable to pipelines of at least five modules with runtimes

        recent years have resulted in the rapid and wide-scale deployment of embedded
        systems as critical components of larger systems such as home appliances,

        workstations themselves are becoming a federation of embedded systems such
        as external storage devices connected with USB and FireWire buses. Such ubiquity
        of embedded systems increases the impact of random and maliciously-induced
        failures and the need for unforeseen improvements. We propose the OASES architecture
        for ensuring the functional survivability of a system composed of embedded
        devices. Given a policy that defines possibly evolving goals of system performance
        and functionality, we aim to satisfy it despite random or maliciously-induced
        failures. Our hypothesis is that functional survivability can be achieved
        with embedded devices open to dynamic reconfiguration and a combination of
        language techniques, component-based programming, traditional dynamic reconfiguration
        mechanisms, and the use of an area controller that coordinates reconfigurations.

        technique for speeding pipelines, but it is stymied by tight sequential cycles.
        Designers usually attack such cycles by manually combining Shannon decomposition

        is error prone. We propose an efficient algorithm that simultaneously applies
        Shannon decomposition and retiming to optimize circuits with tight sequential

        "title": "Using program specialization to speed SystemC fixed-point simulation",
        "abstract": "Generic simulation components, such as fixed-precision arithmetic
        routines, make it easier to quickly assemble system simulations, but generic
        components tend to simulate more slowly than their manually-written specialized
        counterparts. So a system modeler is normally forced to choose between building
        a simulation quickly or running it quickly.This paper explores the use of
        program specialization as a way to address this conundrum. Through hints provided
        by the author of a generic library and aggressive compiler optimizations,
        program specialization can automatically rewrite a generic component into
        a specialized one with performance comparable to a careful manual implementation.
        As a result, the user of such a specializable library can quickly assemble
        a simulation from generic components whose performance can equal that of a
        more tedious implementation.Experimental results show that program specialization
        provides a three- to seven-times speed-up on an important class of simulations:
        signal processing kernels in SystemC that manipulate fixed-precision numbers.",

        hides the fussy details needed to make analyses modular, yet generates code

        "Concurrent programming languages should be a good fit for embedded systems
        because they match the intrinsic parallelism of their architectures and environments.
        Unfortunately, typical concurrent programming formalisms are prone to races
        and nondeterminism, despite the presence of mechanisms such as monitors.In
        this paper, we propose SHIM, the core of a deterministic concurrent language,
        meaning the behavior of a program is independent of the scheduling of concurrent
        operations. SHIM does not sacrifice power or flexibility to achieve this determinism.
        It supports both synchronous and asynchronous paradigms-loosely and tightly
        synchronized threads-the dynamic creation of threads and shared variables,
        recursive procedures, and exceptions.We illustrate our programming model with
        examples including breadth-first-search algorithms and pipelines. By construction,
        they are race-free. We provide the formal semantics of SHIM and a pre-liminary
        implementation.", "venue": "International Conference on Embedded Software",

        augmented with our algorithm. Although our algorithm provides no improvement

        "We present a pointer analysis algorithm designed for source-to-source transformations.
        Existing techniques for pointer analysis apply a collection of inference rules
        to a dismantled intermediate form of the source program, making them difficult
        to apply to source-to-source tools that generally work on abstract syntax
        trees to preserve details of the source program. Our pointer analysis algorithm
        operates directly on the abstract syntax tree of a C program and uses a form
        of standard dataflow analysis to compute the desired points-to information.
        We have implemented our algorithm in a sourceto-source translation framework
        and experimental results show that it is practical on real-world examples.",

        common motivation is hardware/software codesign: today''s systems usually
        contain a mix of hardware and software, and it is often unclear initially
        which portions to implement in hardware. Here, using a single language should
        simplify the migration task. The paper surveys several C-like hardware synthesis

        receptive process is a Kahn process in that it can be modeled by a continuous
        function from input to output sequences, thus verifying it is compositionally

        are mixed. In the five examples we considered, many optimizations clearly
        could be automated cheaply, but we needed more global information to match
        the quality of the existing automatic techniques. This suggests an effective

        and Computer Architecture ( IOSCA \u2013 1 )", "abstract": "Welcome to the
        first Workshop on Interaction between Operating System and Computer Architecture
        (IOSCA-2005). This workshop focuses on characterizing, modeling and optimizing
        the interaction between OS and hardware in light of emerging architecture
        paradigms, workloads and computing technology. The IOSCA workshop aims at
        providing a forum for researchers and engineers from academia and industry
        to discuss their latest research in computer architecture and OS. All submitted
        papers were reviewed by the program committee members. Given the quality of
        the papers that were submitted, it was difficult to decide on the final program.
        But in the end, the program committee decided to accept 6 papers for this
        half day workshop. Our idea was to accept as many papers as possible in order
        to give the ability to researchers to present and get feedback on their ongoing
        research. We hope that by doing so we will stimulate interaction and discussion
        during the workshop. In addition to these 6 regular papers, we also have a
        tutorial on the M5 full system simulation framework. Since full system simulation
        is increasingly important in computer architecture research, the program committee
        accepted this tutorial to be part of the workshop. The tutorial will highlight
        how M5 works, how to properly use M5, and what the most recent features are.
        This first edition of the IOSCA workshop is held in conjunction with the IEEE
        International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC). I therefore
        would like to thank the IISWC general chair Lizy John, program chair David
        Kaeli, and workshop chair John Kalamatianos for accepting this workshop as
        part of the IISWC program. This workshop would not be possible without the
        help and hard work of several people. I would like to thank all the members
        of the program committee who spent considerable time reviewing the manuscripts.
        My gratitude also goes to all members of the IDEAL (Intelligent Design of
        Efficient Architecture Lab) of the University of Florida, who assisted in
        this workshop, especially, James Poe, who served as the publicity and publication
        chairs of this workshop. I would like to thank IISWC web chair Byeong Kil
        Lee for his help. Finally, I would like to thank all of the authors for their
        excellent submissions. Abstract The speed of CPUs and memories has historically

        a new procedure for automatically synthesizing controllers from high-level
        Esterel specifications. Unlike existing RTL synthesis approaches, this approach
        frees the designer from tedious bit-level state encoding and certain types
        of inter-machine communication. Experimental results suggest that even with
        a fairly primitive state assignment heuristic, our compiler consistently produces
        smaller, slightly faster circuits that the existing Esterel compiler. We mainly
        attribute this to a different style of distributing state bits throughout
        the circuit. Initial results are encouraging, but some hand-optimized encodings
        suggest room for a better state assignment algorithm. We are confident that
        such improvements will make our technique even more practical.", "venue":

        of research and experimentation, registertransfer dialects of two standard
        languages\u2014Verilog and VHDL\u2014have emerged as the industry standard
        starting point for automatic large-scale digital integrated circuit synthesis.
        Writing RTL descriptions of hardware remains a largely human process and hence
        the clarity, precision, and ease with which such descriptions can be coded
        correctly has a profound impact on the quality of the final product and the
        speed with which the design can be created. While the efficiency of a design
        (e.g., the speed at which it can run or the power it consumes) is obviously
        important, its correctness is usually the paramount issue, consuming the majority
        of the time (and hence money) spent during the design process. In response
        to this challenge, a number of so-called verification languages have arisen.
        These have been designed to assist in a simulation-based or formal verification
        process by providing mechanisms for checking temporal properties, generating
        pseudorandom test cases, and for checking how much of a design\u2019s behavior
        has been exercised by the test cases. Through examples and discussion, this
        report describes the two main design languages\u2014VHDL and Verilog\u2014as
        well as SystemC, a language currently used to build large simulation models;
        SystemVerilog, a substantial extension of Verilog; and OpenVera, e, and PSL,

        the same function as a given cyclic circuit for those inputs where the cyclic
        circuit does not oscillate or hold state. The algorithm identifies all patterns
        on inputs and internal nodes that lead to acyclic evaluation orders for the
        cyclic circuit, which are represented as acyclic circuit fragments, and then
        combines these to produce an acyclic circuit that can exhibit all of these
        behaviors. Experiments results suggest this potentially exponential algorithm
        is practical for small circuits and may be improved to handle larger circuits.

        "Producing efficient circuits from high-level language descriptions remains

        concurrent language designed to specify control-dominated systems. Together,
        the three techniques aim to improve the quality of the input to logic synthesis
        to produce better results. The first uses control dependence information to
        synthesize small, fast circuits from control-flow graphs. The second involves
        solving the state assignment problem for Esterel-derived circuits at a much
        higher level than has previously been proposed, allowing many more optimization
        opportunities. The third technique extracts don\u2019t-care information from
        high-level representations to improve the quality of logic synthesis. I believe

        "Abstract : Ensuring the security and integrity of computer systems deployed
        on the Internet is growing harder. This is especially true in the case of
        server systems based on open source projects like Linux, Apache, Sendmail,
        etc. since it is easier for a hacker to get access to the binary format of
        deployed applications if the source code to the software is publicly accessible.
        Often, having a binary copy of an application program is enough to help locate
        security vulnerabilities in the program. In the case of legacy systems where
        the source code is not available, advanced reverse-engineering and decompilation
        techniques can be used to construct attacks. This paper focuses on measures
        that reduce the effectiveness of hackers at conducting large-scale, distributed
        attacks. The first line of defense involves additional runtime checks that
        are able to counteract the majority of hacking attacks. Introducing diversity
        in deployed systems to severely diminish the probability of propagation to
        other systems helps to prevent effective attacks like the DDOS attack against

        "Embedded hard real-time software systems often need fine-grained parallelism
        and precise control of timing, things typical real-time operating systems
        do not provide. The Esterel language has both, but compiling large Esterel
        programs has been challenging, producing either needlessly slow or large code.
        This paper presents the first Esterel compiler able to compile large Esterel
        programs into fast, small code. By choosing a concurrent control-now graph
        (CCFG) as its intermediate representation, it preserves many of the control
        constructs to produce code that can be 100 times faster and half the size
        than code from other compilers with similar capacity. The primary contribution
        is an algorithm that generates efficient sequential code from a CCFG. While
        developed specifically for compiling Esterel, the algorithm could be used
        to compile other synchronous languages with fine-grained parallelism.", "venue":

        is a readable general introduction that focuses on mundane issues such as
        compilers, linkers, and target boards. Brown [12] is another very practical
        book, discussing such issues as compilers, linking, and interrupt latency.
        The book contains an extensive example of a pilot control panel. Simon [38]
        is more comprehensive than Barr, speaking of RTOSes. Burns and Wellings [14]
        is an academic text aimed at graduate students. Grehan and Cyliax [25] talks
        more about RTOSes. Ganssle [24] is a broad survey, covering issues such as
        which tools to buy. Probably fairly dated by now. Wolf\u2019s textbook [41]
        is aimed at undergraduates. Bentham [5] talks about implementing TCP/IP, both
        for \u201cnormal\u201d systems and finally an incredibly stripped-down version
        that runs on a tiny 8-bit PIC microcontroller. Thomas and Moorby [40] is the
        standard reference on Verilog, a widely-used language for modeling and specifying
        digital hardware. Ellsberger et al. [19] is the most readable book on SDL,
        a graphical language used mostly in Europe to describe telecommunication protocols.
        The first two chapters of Thoen and Catthoor [39] give a reasonable overview
        of some embedded systems issues. The rest of the book is devoted to their
        Petrinet-like model for embedded software. Gajski et al. [21] resembles Thoen
        and Catthoor [39] in that the early chapters are a reasonable survey of what\u2019s
        going on in the field. The rest describe their particular little-used modeling
        language. A later book [22] describes another of their hardware/software modeling
        languages. Balarin et al. [3] is a complete reference on POLIS, an academic
        tool designed mostly for the synthesis of automotive controllers that laid
        the foundation for Cadence\u2019s commercial VCC tool. Gallmeister [23] describes
        the POSIX.4 standard, the real-time extensions to the Unix-centric POSIX standards.

        This paper presents the first Esterel compiler able to produce small, fast

        the compiler to statically schedule concurrency and synthesize code that efficiently

        "title": "The specification and execution of heterogeneous synchronous reactive
        systems", "abstract": "The need for new languages and paradigms for designing
        software for embedded computing systems continues to grow as general-purpose
        microcontrollers become faster and cheaper. Many of these system need precise
        control over when things happen, yet few languages provide this facility.
        Another major challenge is handling the growing complexity of these systems.
        \nIn this dissertation, I present a new model of computation for embedded
        system software that is the first to fuse precise control over timing with
        the ability to build systems from heterogeneous pieces. It combines the synchronous
        model of time (used in languages such as Esterel) with the hierarchical heterogeneity
        of the Ptolemy system. Heterogeneity addresses the complexity problem by allowing
        each subsystem to be designed using the best language. \nMy two major contributions
        are the formal semantics of this model and an efficient, predictable execution
        scheme for it. Dealing with zero-delay feedback loops, a side-effect of the
        zero-delay assumption needed for synchrony, is the semantic challenge, and
        I solve it with a fixed-point scheme that guarantees all systems are deterministic
        by construction. The execution scheme I present is provably correct and eliminates
        run-time scheduling overhead by making all decisions before the system is
        run. \nI present results that show my model of computation is both efficient
        and can be used to implement practical systems. It is my hope that these ideas
        will be used in the future to make designing complex time-critical embedded
        software easier and less error-prone.", "venue": "", "year": 1998, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Identifying Common Substructure for Incremental Methods", "abstract":
        "In this paper we solve the problem of identifying a \u201cmatching\u201d
        between two logic circuits or \u201cnetworks\u201d. A matching is a functions
        that maps each gate or \u201cnode\u201d in the new circuit into one in the
        old circuit (if a matching does not exist it maps it to null). We present
        both an exact and a heuristic way to solve the maximal matching problem. The
        matching problem does not require any input correspondences; the purpose is
        to identify structurally identical regions in the networks. We apply this
        solution to the problem of incremental design. Logic design is usually an
        iterative process where errors are corrected and optimizations performed repeatedly.
        A designer rectifies, re-optimizes, and rechecks a design many times. In practice,
        it is common for small, incremental changes to be made to the design, rather
        than changing the entirety of the design. Currently, each time the system
        is modified, the entire set of computations (synthesis,verification) are repeated
        from the beginning. This results in unnecessary re-computation of information,
        which can be avoided by re-using results of a previous iteration and information
        about changes to the system. Synthesis and verification tools that recognize
        these sequences of slightlydiffering inputs may be able to outperform their
        counterparts that discard all previous work. This work is concerned with detecting
        what information has changed in a design, and what information may be re-utilized.",

        "title": "An Esterel Compiler for a Synchronous/Reactive Development System",
        "abstract": "The objective of this project was to create a di erent scheme
        for compiling the Esterel synchronous reactive programming language [6, 5,
        4, 9] which could handle larger programs, facilitates debugging, and could
        be easily retargeted toward di erent architectures. The approach presented
        here uses an intermediate representation which is somewhere between a high-level
        reactive language like Esterel and assembly code for a traditional processor.
        This is similar to the ic format used in the Esterel V3 compiler [8] and Baker''s
        NDAM[2, 3]. Compilation proceeds by translating this into assembly code for
        a SPARC processor. This di ers signi cantly from the scheme used in the V3
        compiler, which derives a single nite-state machine representing the behavior
        of the program. The FSM approach o ers fast executables and exact causality
        checking, but su ers from exponential growth of compile times and object code
        sizes. This report describes the Esterel language, the intermediate representation
        used by this new compiler, and how the format is translated into executable
        SPARC assembly code. Its intended audience are those who wish to understand
        the workings of this Esterel compiler and those simply curious about the Esterel

        "title": "The Programming Exercise Markup Language: Towards Reducing the Effort
        Needed to Use Automated Grading Tools", "abstract": "Automated programming
        assignment grading tools have become integral to CS courses at introductory
        as well as advanced levels. However such tools have their own custom approaches
        to setting up assignments and describing how solutions should be tested, requiring
        instructors to make a significant learning investment to begin using a new
        tool. In addition, differences between tools mean that initial investment
        must be repeated when switching tools or adding a new one. Worse still, tool-specific
        strategies further reduce the ability of educators to share and reuse their
        assignments. This paper describes an early experiences with PEML, the Programming
        Exercise Markup Language, which provides an easy to use, instructor friendly
        approach for writing programming assignments. Unlike tool-oriented data interchange
        formats, PEML is designed to provide a human friendly authoring format that
        has been developed to be intuitive, expressive and not be a technological
        or notational barrier to instructors. We describe the design and implementation
        of PEML, both as a programming library and also a public-access web microservice
        that provides full parsing and rendering capabilities for easy integration
        into any tools or scripting libraries. We also describe experiences using
        PEML to describe a full range of programming assignments, laboratory exercises,
        and small coding questions of varying complexity in demonstrating the practicality
        of the notation. The aim is to develop PEML as a community resource to reduce
        the barriers to entry for automated assignment tools while widening the scope
        of programming assignment sharing and reuse across courses and institutions.",

        "title": "Toward a New State-level Framework for Sharing Computer Science
        Content", "abstract": "The process of sharing content among instructors at
        different institutions is not straightforward. In most contexts, \"shared\"
        material is unidirectional: a more experienced instructor shares their materials
        with a more novice instructor; a book publisher provides resources to instructors
        who have adopted their textbook. In a fully-realized sharing ecosystem, this
        flow is bi-directional. Materials can be shared, modified, corrected or edited,
        and then the changes are committed back to the repository for use by everyone
        who has adopted the material. There are many issues that must be addressed
        regarding the sharing process, related to both the actual content, as well
        as the context in which the sharing occurs. In fact, there is a wide opinion
        on what exactly \"sharing\" means. As such, we endeavoured to identify sharing
        opportunities and address issues that sharing course content raises. The primary
        goal of this initiative was to inform the development of ways in which shared
        courses and content can be made available online to share across higher education
        institutions in Virginia, as a potential model to be expanded to other localities
        and disciplines. A multi-institutional team developed a framework for sharing
        course materials within the context of Computer Science at the university-level.
        A number of areas of consideration have been identified as directly impacting
        any sharing scheme. Additionally, non-content related issues were uncovered
        during our investigation. These issues impact the context and process in which
        the sharing may occur. Finally based on the discussions conducted by the working
        group, a preliminary framework has been developed.", "venue": "Technical Symposium

        "abstract": "Performance in CS1 and introductory CS courses has been an area
        of active research in the CS education research community for more than four
        decades, but studies related to student performance in CS2 are not as widely
        available. Past studies have examined the impact of CS1 grade, prior math
        preparation, and other factors such as homework, test, and project grades,
        on the overall performance in CS2. In this work, we will build upon the existing
        research related to CS2 performance with an emphasis on a few factors that
        have not been previously considered for this course. In addition to typical
        factors studied by others (i.e. gender, race, CS1 performance), our work also
        takes into account the impact of various CS1 pathways to CS2 and the number
        of previous college CS courses (including transfer credits) on student performance
        in CS2. We also look into both persistence, by distinguishing students who
        stay in the course versus those who drop from the class before the mid-semester
        drop deadline, and performance. Gender and race were not significant factors
        in determining performance in CS2 but undeclared engineering majors stood
        out as high performers and students'' CS pathway leading to CS2 was also significant.
        Notably, students with CS1 transfer credit had significantly lower pass rates.
        Students with only 1 previous CS course credit were less likely to drop or
        not pass the course.", "venue": "Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education",

        A Replication Study", "abstract": "Static analysis tools evaluate source code
        to identify problems beyond typical compiler errors. Prior work has shown
        a statistically significant relationship between correctness and static analysis
        results. This paper replicates and extends a prior study on FindBugs, a static
        analysis tool aimed at professional Java programmers. The prior study showed
        a strong link between certain FindBugs issues and problems with program correctness.
        It also showed they were significantly associated with struggling, as indicated
        by taking more time, making more submissions, and receiving lower scores.
        However, the study used small programming exercises involving only a handful
        of lines of code from one semester of a CS1 course. This replication study
        uses the same experimental approach, but applies it to full-scale programming
        assignments from hundreds to thousands of lines in length, across all sections
        of CS1, CS2, and CS3 at a large public university over a period of 4 academic
        semesters, and involving 4,244 students in 109 laboratory sections completing
        255,222 submission attempts. The goal of this replication study is to confirm
        how prior results hold up, and to explore how the results apply to full-sized
        programming assignments. We find a set of FindBugs warnings that are inversely
        correlated with correctness and confirm that their presence is still significantly
        associated with struggling on larger programming assignments. However, a larger
        number of FindBugs issues were identified as valuable. We also discuss how

        "title": "Automated Feedback, the Next Generation: Designing Learning Experiences",
        "abstract": "The SIGCSE Technical Symposium is a wonderful venue for learning
        about innovative tools of all sorts for teaching and learning programming.
        We are at the cusp of a new focus for tool research and development, and this
        presentation proposes a vision for the next generation of teaching tools,
        using automated program assessment as an example for how our tools should
        evolve. Beginning in the 1960s, the first generation of automated program
        grading tools focused on workflow automation. Automating the processing of
        student work to increase the speed and accuracy of mechanical steps would
        reduce the time human graders spend on these tasks, allowing them to be more
        effective at the more meaningful aspects of grading. After mastering automation,
        the second generation of autograders focused on assessment--specifically,
        increasingly better strategies for evaluating the quality and correctness
        of student work. The last two decades have seen significant work in this area,
        resulting in a change in terms to \"automated program assessment tools.\"
        Now, we are beginning to see a new focus emerge, which will lead to a new
        generation of tools for teaching and learning. While assessing the final product
        that a student creates is the essence of the \"grading\" task, our goal as
        educators is not to grade, but to teach. One great benefit of automated program
        assessment tools is that they provide feedback to students with the aim of
        helping students to improve their work and to learn. Indeed, the assessment
        tool and the student form a closed-loop feedback system, and we should not
        ignore the role the human plays in that system. It is not enough to objectively
        and accurately assess the work product--we must consider how the feedback
        itself and the way it is delivered affect the student''s experience, with
        the goal of contributing to student learning. The student''s experience in
        receiving feedback can affect their beliefs, their motivation, and their behavior.
        Instead of focusing primarily on the work product (the solution being produced),
        tool researchers need to broaden their perspectives to adopt specific goals
        for student learning that their tools will promote. Improving self-efficacy,
        encouraging a growth mindset, encouraging students who are challenged, recognizing
        accomplishments, and fostering active engagement are all aspects a human grader
        may consider when providing feedback by hand, and the same concerns should
        inform the design of automated feedback. A holistic view of how the feedback
        affects the learner is essential. As a result, I advocate moving from a tool-centric
        perspective toward designing complete learning experiences, where the student
        interacting with a teaching tool through feedback is explicitly considered.
        The primary goal is to foster targeted changes in specific beliefs, behaviors,
        skills, and knowledge in the student, rather than just to \"grade\" their
        work. By focusing on the student experience and the intended changes (or learning
        or growth) in the student as the goal, we can reframe the nature of \"assessment\"
        tools in a way that will change our outlook on what can be accomplished.",

        Instruction to Increase Student Comfort and Success in Computing", "abstract":
        "Very little research exists on the incorporation of co-curricular opportunities,
        specifically capture-the-flag (CTF) activities, and the impact on computer
        science students. However, some literature on underrepresented groups in the
        field of computer science indicates that co-curricular experiences, such as
        CTF activities, have a significant impact on efficacy and sense of belonging.
        This experience report seeks to identify and share teaching strategies that
        impact student learning, efficacy, and sense of self/belonging in the field
        of Computer Science, for all students. In an effort to design learning opportunities
        to help bridge the gap between the haves and have nots, and maximize learning
        for all students, this strategy uses CTF-based instruction as a way to generate
        and support culture-based, computer science experiences. The aim is to identify
        instructional strategies that build students'' computing skills and improve
        their comfort participating in computing activities thus broadening participation
        in computing and cybersecurity. As students'' comfort is related to their
        self-efficacy and sense of belonging, we explore the integration of co-curricular
        opportunities, specifically a capture-the-flag (CTF) approach to computer
        science instruction, as means of increasing student success, with regard to
        learning, efficacy, and sense of belonging/identity. This report involves
        a description of the class activities as well as data from a series of pre-
        and post- surveys of the student experience, attitudes, and gain in knowledge.
        Initial analysis indicates that low-stakes, entry-level exposure to computer
        science concepts has a positive effect on student comfort and skill acquisition
        in computing domains external to coursework.", "venue": "Annual Conference

        tests using selectivemutation analysis", "abstract": "As incorporating software
        testing into programming assignments becomes routine, educators have begun
        to assess not only the correctness of students\u2019 software, but also the
        adequacy of their tests. In practice, educators rely on code coverage measures,
        though its shortcomings are widely known. Mutation analysis is a stronger
        measure of test adequacy, but it is too costly to be applied beyond the small
        programs developed in introductory programming courses. We demonstrate how
        to adapt mutation analysis to provide rapid automated feedback on software
        tests for complex projects in large programming courses. We study a dataset
        of 1389 student software projects ranging from trivial to complex. We begin
        by showing that although the state-of-the-art in mutation analysis is practical
        for providing rapid feedback on projects in introductory courses, it is prohibitively
        expensive for the more complex projects in subsequent courses. To reduce this
        cost, we use a statistical procedure to select a subset of mutation operators
        that maintains accuracy while minimizing cost. We show that with only 2 operators,
        costs can be reduced by a factor of 2\u20133 with negligible loss in accuracy.
        Finally, we evaluate our approach on open-source software and report that
        our findings may generalize beyond our educational context. \u00a9 2021 The

        with 3\u20134 week long projects. First, we interviewed 12 students of varying
        project performances. From the interviews, we identified five techniques that
        students use for both testing and debugging: 1) writing diagnostic print statements,
        2) unit testing, 3) using source-level debugger, 4) submission to online auto-grader,
        and 5) manual tracing. Using the Grounded Theory approach, we developed four
        hypotheses regarding students\u2019 use of multiple techniques and their possible
        impact on performance. We used clickstream data to analyze the level of use
        of the first four of these techniques. We found that over 92%, 87%, and 73%
        of the students used JUnit testing, diagnostic print statements, and the source-level
        debugger, respectively. We found that the majority of the students (91%) used
        more than one technique to investigate bugs in their projects. Moreover, students
        who used multiple techniques had overall better performance in the projects.
        Finally, we identified some ineffective practices correlated with lower project
        scores. We believe that the findings of our research will help understand,
        characterize, and teach better practices of bug investigation.", "venue":

        that encourages students to adopt five core self-regulation skills: time management,
        incremental development, self-checking, persistence, and planning. We encourage
        growth mindset beliefs by reinforcing that skills can be increased and improved
        through targeted effort and practice. The self-regulation skills chosen are
        all associated with successful scholastic performance and present a model
        of \u201cworking smarter, not harder\u201d. They relate to the student\u2019s
        process of working, rather than the assignment solution being produced. A
        combination of role-playing game character development, experience points,

        are used as game mechanics. The goal is to communicate to students that mastery
        of these skills is valued by the course\u2019s community, to encourage students
        to aspire to master these skills, and to recognize and reward students as
        they progress and eventually achieve these goals. The design leverages existing

        to Help Students Successfully Complete Programming Problems Faster", "abstract":
        "Automated grading systems provide feedback to students in a variety of ways,
        but they typically focus on identifying incorrect program behaviors. Such
        systems provide notices of test case failures or runtime errors, but without
        debugging skills, students often become frustrated when they don''t know where
        to start addressing these defects. Borrowing from work in software engineering
        research related to automated defect location, we leverage previous research
        describes using statistical fault localization (SFL) techniques to identify
        the probable locations of defects in student coding assignments. The goal
        is to use these SFL techniques to provide a scaffold for students, to direct
        their debugging efforts without giving too much guidance, and thus minimizing
        the learning associated with investigating the defects. After determining
        the \u201csuspiciousness\u201d for each line of code involved in the defect,
        we create a \u201cheat map\u201d visualization overlay onto their source code
        of the \u201csuspiciousness\u201d scores to visually guide a student''s attention
        to parts of their code that are most likely to contain problems. This paper
        describes the results of an analysis comparing two semesters of CS 1114: Introduction
        to Software Design (CS1) students, one which had access to the heat map feedback
        (Fall 2017: n~170), and one that did not (Fall 2015: n~270). The results show
        that when the heat maps were available, students found it easier to make improvements
        on their code from submission to submission, as well as spending less time
        overall achieving the maximum score on the instructor testing assessments.
        In fact, while we were optimistic in the impact of the heat map feedback,
        the results we observed were unexpectedly strong. To address this concern,
        we conducted an additional study, using student submissions from our Spring
        2019 CS 1 students (n~230). The results of the second analysis confirmed the
        results of the first.", "venue": "2020 IEEE/ACM 42nd International Conference

        are increasingly utilized in undergraduate programming courses to evaluate
        software solutions, streamlining the grading process for both students and
        professors. In spite of their bene\ufb01ts of speed and convenience, such
        online systems for providing instant feedback have the tendency to draw attention
        to performance-based outcomes while failing to reliably recognize the effort
        and hard work a student puts into a solution. For the many struggling students
        who are new to programming, this type of objective feedback can be discouraging
        and may decrease their motivation to stay engaged towards success. To address
        this issue, this paper explores strategies for more effectively recognizing

        students to complete that will steer them in the right direction. Further,

        "title": "The Value of Aligning Your Course for Curricular Improvement", "abstract":
        "CS research has shown that many CS educators do not use an evidence-based
        approach to make changes to their course. Fossati and Guzdial have found that
        educators use their intuition, student feedback and anecdotal evidence to
        make course improvements. Using these approaches makes it difficult to identify
        the effectiveness of the improvement. In instructional design, curriculum
        alignment is used to evaluate the degree which the learning objectives, course
        content, and assessment methods are in agreement with each other. This provides
        instructors with a detailed view of their course and areas that need improvement.
        Current alignment processes are impractical for a course instructor to apply,
        requiring a panel of experts and training on the process. We developed a new
        alignment process applicable by a single course instructor limiting the need
        for a panel of experts, however the process took 75 hours to apply. In this
        paper, we describe a prototype alignment tool, AlignET, that automates the
        new alignment process providing instructors with results they can use to make
        course improvements. We conducted a case study, where four instructors at
        Virginia Tech used AlignET to evaluate the alignment of their course and identified
        specific improvements to make to their course. AlignET reduced the time to
        complete the alignment process to less than 11 hours. The instructors identified
        gaps in their instructional methods and identified learning objectives they
        emphasized more than others. The case study provided us with critical improvements
        to make to AlignET.", "venue": "European Conference on Modelling and Simulation",

        taught post-CS2. Method We identified the misconceptions students have in
        recursive operations on binary trees. We designed a code writing exam question
        to measure those misconceptions. We built a tutorial that trains students
        on avoiding those misconceptions through the use of a semantic code analyzer
        that detects misconceptions and provides appropriate feedback. Findings Our
        results show an improvement in student performance when using the tutorial
        along with the practice exercises, and even more improvement when the same
        exercises are used with a semantic code analyzer. Implications The best way
        to use our tutorial to enhance student performance on advanced recursion is
        to allow students solving the tutorial exercises with the the semantic feedback.",

        "title": "Assessing Incremental Testing Practices and Their Impact on Project
        Outcomes", "abstract": "Software testing is an important aspect of the development
        process, one that has proven to be a challenge to formally introduce into
        the typical undergraduate CS curriculum. Unfortunately, existing assessment
        of testing in student software projects tends to focus on evaluation of metrics
        like code coverage over the finished software product, thus eliminating the
        possibility of giving students early feedback as they work on the project.
        Furthermore, assessing and teaching the process of writing and executing software
        tests is also important, as shown by the multiple variants proposed and disseminated
        by the software engineering community, e.g., test-driven development (TDD)
        or incremental test-last (ITL). We present a family of novel metrics for assessment
        of testing practices for increments of software development work, thus allowing
        early feedback before the software project is finished. Our metrics measure
        the balance and sequence of effort spent writing software tests in a work
        increment. We performed an empirical study using our metrics to evaluate the
        test-writing practices of 157 advanced undergraduate students, and their relationships
        with project outcomes over multiple projects for a whole semester. We found
        that projects where more testing effort was spent per work session tended
        to be more semantically correct and have higher code coverage. The percentage
        of method-specific testing effort spent before production code did not contribute
        to semantic correctness, and had a negative relationship with code coverage.
        These novel metrics will enable educators to give students early, incremental
        feedback about their testing practices as they work on their software projects.",

        analysis tools evaluate source code to identify potential problems or issues
        beyond typical compiler errors. Prior work has shown a statistically significant
        relationship between the correctness of a student\u2019s work and statically
        identifiable flaws or \"code smells\" that are likely to indicate programming
        errors. This paper presents a comprehensive study of this relationship in
        the context of small programming exercises intended for use in student skill
        building. We use FindBugs, a static analysis tool that identifies program
        features that are likely to represent actual bugs in professional software.
        Our goal is to identify the extent to which FindBugs warnings might help novices
        struggling to solve short programming exercises. In this study, we ran FindBugs
        against 149,054 answers submitted by 516 students on 57 drill-and-practice
        coding exercises. We identify the specific FindBugs warnings that are inversely
        correlated with correctness. We confirm that presence of these warnings is
        significantly associated with struggling on an exercise, as indicated by taking
        more time, making more submissions, and receiving lower scores. Finally, every
        exercise exhibited answers that trigger these warnings, and 92.4% of students
        would experience these warnings over a full semester. Our results indicate

        "title": "The Relationship Between Voluntary Practice of Short Programming
        Exercises and Exam Performance", "abstract": "Learning to program can be challenging.
        Many instructors use drill-and-practice strategies to help students develop
        basic programming techniques and improve their confidence. Online systems
        that provide short programming exercises with immediate, automated feedback
        are seeing more frequent use in this regard. However, the relationship between
        practicing with short programming exercises and performance on larger programming
        assignments or exams are unclear. This paper describes an evaluation of short
        programming questions in the context of a CS1 course where they were used
        on both homework assignments, for practice and learning, and on exams, for
        assessing individual performance. The open-source drill-and-practice system
        used here provides for full feedback during practice exercises. During exams,
        it allows limiting feedback to compiler errors and to a very small number
        of example inputs shown in the question, instead of the more complete feedback
        received during practice. Using data collected from 200 students in a CS1
        course, we examine the relationship between voluntary practice on short exercises
        and subsequent performance on exams, while using an early exam as a control
        for individual differences including ability level. Results indicate that,
        after controlling for ability, voluntary practice does contribute to improved
        performance on exams, but that motivation to improve may also be important.",

        "title": "Board 43: Designing Boosters and Recognition to Promote a Growth
        Mindset in Programming Activities", "abstract": "When one first learns to
        program, feedback on early assignments can easily induce a fixed mindset\u2014where
        one believes programming is a fixed ability you either have or you don\u2019t.
        However, possessing a fixed mindset perspective has negative consequences
        for learning. The alternative is to foster a growth mindset, where one believes
        ability can be improved through practice, effort, and hard work. However,
        automated grading tools used on programming assignments currently focus on
        objectively assessing functional correctness and other performance-oriented
        features of students\u2019 programs. Unfortunately this encourages students
        to adopt performance-oriented goals, which are characteristic of a fixed mindset.
        By building on existing measures of \u201cproductive effort\u201d, we design
        a new kind of feedback approach that focuses on recognizing, encouraging,
        and rewarding diligence and productive actions based on those indicators.
        The goal is to add such elements to existing feedback in an emotionally supportive
        way that recognizes the efforts of a student expending and valuing these practices.
        The feedback design presented here consists of two main components: textual/verbal
        feedback that recognizes productive effort students spend on a problem, or
        that encourages students to be strategic about expending effort to improve
        their own skills. The point of this feedback is to convey to the student that
        constructive practice to improve one\u2019s skills is valued and recognized,
        independently of the final product they are creating. In addition to the textual
        feedback, the feedback also includes boosters, or rewards in the form of perks
        that enhance parts of the student work experience. By taking inspiration from
        video game psychology and other sources, we designed a booster-based reward
        system that recognizes hard work without tacitly promoting performance-oriented
        (score-oriented) motivation. In addition to describing the design of the reward
        and recognition feedback strategy and the variable ratio reinforcement schedule
        on which the strategy is based, we also present a post hoc analysis of the
        results obtained when applying this strategy to existing student submission
        data. This allows investigating what feedback or boosters would have been
        earned by individual students in a real-life situation to validate the feedback
        design before live deployment.", "venue": "", "year": 2019, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Can Mobile Gaming Psychology Be Used to Improve Time Management
        on Programming Assignments?", "abstract": "Students often procrastinate on
        assignments, sometimes to the extent that it negatively affects their work.
        Although many solutions have been researched, instructors continue searching
        for effective techniques that are easy to employ and require little faculty
        overhead. This paper describes experiences adapting techniques inspired by
        commercially successful mobile games. These games use structural features
        that limit the player''s play time, and use reward systems to encourage students
        to cultivate game-based resources (like energy, gold, credits, etc.). This
        combination of limits plus incentives shapes the way players manage their
        play time: it deters \"binge\" play sessions and strongly promotes the use
        of a much larger number of play sessions spread over a longer period of time.
        By adapting this to the assignment self-checking and turn-in process, we hope
        to exert a similar effect on how students manage their time in completing
        assignments. The goal is to shift students to start earlier and spread their
        work time out over a longer period, engaging with the assignment more frequently.
        In addition to combating procrastination, this also offers a longer time frame
        to seek help from course staff when problems arise. We report on experiences
        using this strategy over a year and a half in CS 1, discuss the impact on
        student submission patterns, when students begin their work, how they spread
        their work out over time, and student perceptions of the technique.", "venue":

        Outcomes", "abstract": "Debugging is an important part of the software development
        process, studied by both the CS education and software engineering communities.
        Most prior work has focused either on novice or professional programmers.
        Intermediate-to-advanced students (such as those enrolled in post-CS2 Data
        Structures courses) who are working on large and complex projects have largely
        been ignored. We present results from an empirical observational study that
        examined junior-level undergraduate students'' debugging practices on relatively
        large (4-week lifecycle) projects, using IDE clickstream data collected by
        a custom Eclipse plugin. Specifically, we hypothesize that there are differing
        debugging behaviors exhibited, and that differing behaviors lead to differing
        project out-comes. For example, how often do students use the symbolic debugger
        available in modern IDEs, versus how often do they use diagnostic print statements,
        or both? What triggers a debugging session? What follows a debugging session?
        Does it matter when in the project lifecycle that debugging takes place? We
        have a number of interesting preliminary results. When using the debugger,
        there was a negative relationship between step-over and step-into actions
        versus final course grades, indicating that when students \"spin their wheels\"
        while debugging, they tend to perform more poorly. Students also tend to perform
        better on the project when debugging takes place earlier in the overall project
        life-cycle. We developed an algorithm to identify diagnostic print statements
        in the students'' projects. We found that over 90% used at least one diagnostic
        print statement, and about 75% used the symbolic debugger, at least once in
        any given project.", "venue": "Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education",

        with the goal of enabling collaboration by helping them to collect and share

        study to evaluate how ProgSnap2 can facilitate collaborative research. We
        investigated three metrics designed to quantify students'' difficulty with
        compiler errors - the Error Quotient, Repeated Error Density and Watwin score
        - and compared their distributions and ability to predict students'' performance.
        We analyzed five different ProgSnap2 datasets, spanning a variety of contexts
        and programming languages. We found that each error metric is mildly predictive
        of students'' performance. We reflect on how the common data format allowed

        "title": "Experiences Using Heat Maps to Help Students Find Their Bugs: Problems
        and Solutions", "abstract": "Automated grading systems provide feedback to
        students in a variety of ways, but usually focus on identifying incorrect
        program behaviors. Such systems provide notices of test case failures or runtime
        errors, but without debugging skills, students often become frustrated when
        they don''t know where to start. They know their code has defects, but finding
        the problem may be beyond their experience, especially for beginners. An additional
        concern is balancing the need to provide enough direction to be useful, without
        giving the student so much direction that you effectively give them the answer.
        This paper presents our experience using heat maps to visually guide student
        attention to parts of their code that are most likely to contain problems.
        These visualizations are generated using existing tools that capture execution
        traces from instructor-written tests to identify which portions of the code
        are executed during tests that pass, and which portions are executed during
        tests that fail. Superimposing execution footprints allows statistical identification
        of locations in the student''s code that are most likely to contain faults.
        This paper describes the results of using this feedback approach to help guide
        student attention with heat map visualizations over two semesters of CS1 involving
        over 700 students. Based on this experience, we analyze the utility of the
        heat maps, describe student perceptions of their helpfulness, and describe
        the unexpected challenges arising from students attempts to understand and
        apply this style of feedback. We conclude with concrete solutions proposed
        to improve how guiding feedback is presented to students.", "venue": "Technical

        (Abstract Only)", "abstract": "Pedagogical agents have received a large amount
        of interest in the recent years. Equipped with the ability to express emotions,
        these agents can influence the user attitudes, perceptions and behaviour.
        In our study, we are leveraging these emotionally-intelligent pedagogical
        agents to deliver effective and efficient feedback to students about their
        programming assignments and also act as a teaching assistant for any general
        programming related queries. We have integrated the pedagogical agent as part
        of Web-CAT - an automated online grading tool for students'' programs. One
        of our main objectives is to communicate clearly the feedback about student
        programs while motivating them to perform better. Displaying the feedback
        and motivational messages to students all the time can quickly become noise
        and students tend to ignore them. Our study is to strategically have the pedagogical
        agent communicate with the student to provide them growth mindset feedback
        and also provide motivation to improve upon their work. The feedback would
        be based upon few indicators which would be triggered based on the student''s
        program and the agent would guide the students to the correct solution by
        providing appropriate suggestions. The students can also voluntarily ask the
        agent for feedback and areas of improvement in their work. In addition, the
        agent can also help the students with any programming related queries or ways
        to fix a specific error encountered in the student''s program. We will conduct
        a user study to gather feedback from students about the influence of the agent

        Ed researchers increasingly make use of the large collections of data generated

        could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple
        perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic
        uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this
        work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented
        computer science courses as a way to increase the students\u2019 knowledge

        review process, the effects of the type of review on the reviewers, and the
        results this has on the students\u2019 learning. To study these ideas, we
        used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course
        of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing
        the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we
        measured the students\u2019 conceptual understanding throughout the semester
        with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing
        helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor''s
        programs, but we did not find that it improved the students\u2019 level of
        thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching
        Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for

        "title": "Quantifying Incremental Development Practices and Their Relationship
        to Procrastination", "abstract": "We present quantitative analyses performed
        on character-level program edit and execution data, collected in a junior-level
        data structures and algorithms course. The goal of this research is to determine
        whether proposed measures of student behaviors such as incremental development
        and procrastination during their program development process are significantly
        related to the correctness of final solutions, the time when work is completed,
        or the total time spent working on a solution. A dataset of 6.3 million fine-grained
        events collected from each student''s local Eclipse environment is analyzed,
        including the edits made and events such as running the program or executing
        software tests. We examine four primary metrics proposed as part of previous
        work, and also examine variants and refinements that may be more effective.
        We quantify behaviors such as working early and often, frequency of program
        and test executions, and incremental writing of software tests. Projects where
        the author had an earlier mean time of edits were more likely to submit their
        projects earlier and to earn higher scores for correctness. Similarly earlier
        median time of edits to software tests was also associated with higher correctness
        scores. No significant relationships were found with incremental test writing
        or incremental checking of work using either interactive program launches
        or running of software tests, contrary to expectations. A preliminary prediction
        model with 69% accuracy suggests that the underlying metrics may support early
        prediction of student success on projects. Such metrics also can be used to
        give targeted feedback to help students improve their development practices.",

        "abstract": "Learning programming techniques can be challenging and frustrating
        for many students. Many instructors use drill-and-practice strategies to help
        students develop basic programming techniques and improve their confidence.
        Online systems that provide short programming exercises with immediate, automated
        feedback are often seen as a valuable approach to drill-and-practice. However,
        the relationship between practicing with short programming exercises and performance
        on larger programming assignments or exams is unclear. This paper describes
        CodeWorkout, an open-source drill-and-practice system that supports short
        programming exercises and multiple choice questions. CodeWorkout combines
        an open, gradual engagement model that allows any student to practice exercises,
        whether or not they have an account or are enrolled in a course, together
        with powerful course management features that support graded assignments,
        quizzes, and even practicum style exams. It also provides a rich data collection
        and evaluation infrastructure for educational research purposes. We report

        Suggestions to Student Programmers", "abstract": "Automated grading systems
        are useful for conveying debugging feedback to students, but the manner in
        which this feedback is displayed can be problematic for students. Automated
        systems usually report failures in student code, whether it be the results
        of test case failures or runtime errors. However, since most students are
        not explicitly taught how to debug, many get stuck. They know the defects
        exist, but they don''t have to experience to know how to find them. Much work
        has been done in software engineering research using automatic fault localization
        to programmatically locate bugs within a piece of code under test, as well
        as research into validating those detection models when applied to student
        code.\n However, determining how to present that information back to the student
        has not been addressed. There is a balance between giving hints and telling
        the student exactly where the error occurred. The goal of this paper is to
        present a technique to present the student''s code with suggestions to the
        student of where to investigate, based on the results of the automatic fault
        location. Taking results from the GZoltar statistical fault localization library,
        we have developed a method of expressing the suggestions to the students by
        visualizing the potential defect locations within the context of the student''s
        source code using heatmaps.", "venue": "IFAC Symposium on Advances in Control

        Development and Procrastination", "abstract": "Good project management practices
        are hard to teach, and hard for novices to learn. Procrastination and bad
        project management practice occur frequently, and may interfere with successfully
        completing major programming projects in mid-level programming courses. Students
        often see these as abstract concepts that do not need to be actively applied
        in practice. Changing student behavior requires changing how this material
        is taught, and more importantly, changing how learning and practice are assessed.
        To provide proper assessment, we need to collect detailed data about how each
        student conducts their project development as they work on solutions. We present
        DevEventTracker, a system that continuously collects data from the Eclipse
        IDE as students program, giving us in-depth insight into students'' programming
        habits. We report on data collected using DevEventTracker over the course
        of four programming projects involving 370 students in five sections of a
        Data Structures and Algorithms course over two semesters. These data support
        a new measure for how well students apply \"incremental development\" practices.
        We present a detailed description of the system, our methodology, and an initial
        evaluation of our ability to accurately assess incremental development on
        the part of the students. The goal is to help students improve their programming
        habits, with an emphasis on incremental development and time management.",

        "title": "Investigating Static Analysis Errors in Student Java Programs",
        "abstract": "Research on students learning to program has produced studies
        on both compile-time errors (syntax errors) and run-time errors (exceptions).
        Both of these types of errors are natural targets, since detection is built
        into the programming language. In this paper, we present an empirical investigation
        of static analysis errors present in syntactically correct code. Static analysis
        errors can be revealed by tools that examine a program''s source code, but
        this error detection is typically not built into common programming languages
        and instead requires separate tools. Static analysis can be used to check
        formatting or commenting expectations, but it also can be used to identify
        problematic code or to find some kinds of conceptual or logic errors. We study
        nearly 10 million static analysis errors found in over 500 thousand program
        submissions made by students over a five-semester period. The study includes
        data from four separate courses, including a non-majors introductory course
        as well as the CS1/CS2/CS3 sequence for CS majors. We examine the differences
        between the error rates of CS major and non-major beginners, and also examine
        how these patterns change over time as students progress through the CS major
        course sequence. Our investigation shows that while formatting and Javadoc
        issues are the most common, static checks that identify coding flaws that
        are likely to be errors are strongly correlated with producing correct programs,
        even when students eventually fix the problems. With experience, students
        produce fewer errors, but the errors that are most frequent are consistent
        between both computer science majors and non-majors, and across experience
        levels. These results can highlight student struggles or misunderstandings
        that have escaped past analyses focused on syntax or run-time errors.", "venue":

        authors. The analysis extends to the contributions from different countries.
        The conclusion is that the community of ICER authors is truly international,

        during solution development", "abstract": "When learning to program, assignment
        feedback can easily reinforce a fixed mindset---where one believes intelligence
        is a fixed ability you either have or you don''t. However, this can have negative
        consequences for learning. The alternative is a growth mindset, where one
        believes intelligence is malleable and can be improved through practice, effort,
        and hard work. We develop a set of fifteen progress indicators that can be
        used to assess student programming effort independently of the correctness
        of their code. The goal is to provide the measurement support needed for innovative
        feedback that gives a more welcoming experience for students, recognizing
        the effort they put in and the accomplishments they make as they work on solutions,
        rather than simply looking at whether code \"works\". Our set of progress
        indicators includes seven associated with writing solution code for a problem
        that are suitable for use on all programming assignments, and eight associated
        with self-checking programs using software tests, which are appropriate for
        assignments where students are required to test their own work. In this initial
        work, we applied these indicators to a collection of programming assignments
        from 257 students to determine the suitability of the measures and validate
        their results. The resulting set of progress indicators is the first step
        toward developing feedback strategies that recognize and reward effort and
        hard work, with the goal of fostering the development of a growth mindset

        "title": "Examining Classroom Interventions to Reduce Procrastination", "abstract":
        "Procrastination is a common problem for students. Many believe procrastination
        may keep otherwise competent students from succeeding. However, the most effective
        interventions for procrastination are resource-intensive---providing supplemental
        training or courses in study skills and self-regulation. These techniques
        do not scale to large courses. This paper investigates three new classroom
        interventions designed to be low-cost and low-effort to implement. Reflective
        writing assignments ask students to reflect on how their time management choices
        affect their work. Project schedule sheets require students to plan out and
        schedule specific tasks on their projects. E-mail situational awareness alerts
        give students feedback on how their progress compares to others, and to expectations.
        353 students over two semesters of a junior-level advanced data structures
        course participated in a study where these interventions were investigated.
        While neither reflective writing assignments nor schedule sheets produced
        any significant effect, e-mail alerts were associated with both significantly
        reduced rates of late program submissions, and increased rates of early program
        submissions. As a result, this intervention shows promise for further investigation
        as a potential strategy for reducing late submissions among students.", "venue":

        "title": "The Effects of Procrastination Interventions on Programming Project
        Success", "abstract": "In computer science, procrastination and related problems
        with managing programming projects are viewed as primary causes of student
        attrition. Unfortunately, the most successful techniques for reducing procrastination
        (such as courses in study skills) are resource-intensive and do not scale
        to large classrooms. In this paper, we describe three course interventions
        that are designed to be scalable for large classrooms and require few resources
        to implement. Reflective writing assignments require students to consciously
        consider how their time management choices impact their classroom performance.
        Schedule sheets force students to actively plan out the time required to solve
        a programming project. Email alerts inform students of their progress relative
        to their peers as they work on an assignment, and suggest ways to improve
        behavior if their progress is found to be unsatisfactory. We implemented these
        interventions in a junior-level data structures course and analyzed data from
        330 students over two semesters. Separate analyses of reflective writing responses,
        schedule sheet contents, and e-mail alert contents are discussed, along with
        student opinions about the value and effectiveness of each treatment. We found
        a statistically significant relationship between the time when work is completed
        and its quality, with late work being of lower quality. We found that one
        of the three interventions had a statistically significant effect on reducing

        "Writing meaningful software tests requires students to think critically about
        a problem and consider a variety of cases that might break the solution code.
        Consequently, to overcome bugs in their code, it would be beneficial for students
        to reflect over their work and write robust tests rather than relying on trial-and-error
        techniques. Automated grading systems provide students with prompt feedback
        on their programming assignments and may help them identify where their interpretation
        of requirements do not match the instructor''s expectations. However, when
        automated grading systems help students identify bugs in their code, the systems
        may inadvertently discourage students from thinking critically and testing
        thoroughly and instead encourage dependence on the instructor''s tests. In
        this paper, we explain a framework for identifying whether a student has adequately
        tested a specific feature of their code that is failing an instructor''s tests.
        Using an implementation of the framework, we analyzed an automated grading
        system''s feedback for programming assignments and found that it often provided
        hints that may discourage reflective testing.", "venue": "Technical Symposium

        systems are useful for generating real-time feedback for students, they also

        bugs, automated systems report this fact, but not how to locate or correct
        them. This paper reports on a study inspired by current research on automatic
        fault localization - techniques to programmatically locate bugs within a piece
        of code under test. The goal is not to \"identify\" or diagnose the bug, but
        simply to locate where it is in the code, to give the student a direction
        to investigate. Before employing this technique live with students, this study
        validates that automated fault localization can be performed with the level
        of accuracy needed to give meaningful guidance. We used the GZoltar statistical
        fault localization library for Java to analyze 135 CS2-level student programs,
        and then manually debugged the programs to find the locations of their faults.

        "title": "Checked Coverage and Object Branch Coverage: New Alternatives for
        Assessing Student-Written Tests", "abstract": "Many educators currently use
        code coverage metrics to assess student-written software tests. While test
        adequacy criteria such as statement or branch coverage can also be used to
        measure the thoroughness of a test suite, they have limitations. Coverage
        metrics assess what percentage of code has been exercised, but do not depend
        on whether a test suite adequately checks that the expected behavior is achieved.
        This paper evaluates checked coverage, an alternative measure of test thoroughness
        aimed at overcoming this limitation, along with object branch coverage, a
        structure code coverage metric that has received little discussion in educational
        assessment. Checked coverage works backwards from behavioral assertions in
        test cases, measuring the dynamic slice of the executed code that actually
        influences the outcome of each assertion. Object branch coverage (OBC) is
        a stronger coverage criterion similar to weak variants of modified condition/decision
        coverage. We experimentally compare checked coverage and OBC against statement
        coverage, branch coverage, mutation analysis, and all-pairs testing to evaluate
        which is the best predictor of how likely a test suite is to detect naturally
        occurring defects. While checked coverage outperformed other coverage measures
        in our experiment, followed closely by OBC, both were only weakly correlated
        with a test suite''s ability to detect naturally occurring defects produced
        by students in the final versions of their programs. Still, OBC appears to
        be an improved and practical alternative to existing statement and branch
        coverage measures, while achieving nearly the same benefits as checked coverage.",

        programs", "abstract": "Infinite looping problems that keep student programs
        from termi-nating may occur in many kinds of programming assignments. While
        non-terminating code is easier to diagnose interactively, it poses different
        concerns when software tests are being run auto-matically in batch. The common
        strategy of using a timeout to preemptively kill test runs that execute for
        too long has limita-tions, however. When one test case gets stuck in an infinite
        loop, forcible termination prevents any later test cases from running. Worse,
        when test results are buffered inside a test execution framework, forcible
        termination may prevent any information from being produced. Further, overly
        generous timeouts can de-lay the availability of results, and when tests are
        executed on a shared server, one non-terminating program can delay results
        for many people. This paper describes an alternative strategy that uses a
        fine-grained timeout on the execution of each individual test case in a test
        suite, and that adaptively adjusts this timeout dynamically based on the termination
        behavior of test cases com-pleted so far. By avoiding forcible termination
        of test runs, this approach allows all test cases an opportunity to run and
        produce results, even when infinite looping behaviors occur. Such fine-grained
        timeouts also result in faster completion of entire test runs when non-terminating
        code is present. Experimental results from applying this strategy to 4,214
        student-written programs are dis-cussed, along with experiences from live
        deployment in the class-room where 8,926 non-termination events were detected

        "title": "Evaluating Quality of Student-Written Tests", "abstract": "Software
        testing is important, but judging whether a set of software tests are effective
        is hard. The same problem also appears in the classroom as educators frequently
        include software testing activities in assignments. While tests can be hand-graded,
        some educators use objective performance metrics to assess software tests,
        just as professionals do. The most common measures used at present are code
        coverage measures\u2014 tracking how much of the student\u2019s code (in terms
        of statements, branches, or some combination) is exercised by the corresponding
        software tests. Code coverage has limitations as it does not assess whether
        computational results from the executed code are checked against expectations,
        and sometimes it overestimates the true quality of the tests. We alternatively
        evaluate students\u2019 tests on how many defects the tests can detect from
        injected errors\u2014mutation testing\u2014 and actual errors present is others
        code\u2014all-pairs testing. We overcome a number of technical challenges
        to apply these two approaches in classroom assessment systems. Afterwards,
        we compare all three methods\u2014all-pairs testing, mutation testing and
        code coverage\u2014in terms of how well they predict defect detection capabilities
        of student-written tests when run against a large collection of known, authentic,
        human-written errors. Experimental results encompassing over 700,000 test
        runs show that all-pairs testing is the most effective predictor of the underlying
        bug revealing capability of a test suite. Further, no strong correlation was
        found between bug revealing capability and either code coverage or mutation
        analysis scores. Investigating effectiveness of student written tests we find
        that, students are mainly \u201chappy path\u201d testers \u2013 purpose of
        their writing tests is to show that their code \u201cworked\u201d rather than
        finding real errors. 1. PROBLEM AND MOTIVATION Testing accounts for 50% of
        the cost of software development. Because of the necessity of testing, educators
        are including more and more software testing as a part of programming and
        software engineering assignments. Automatic assessment systems (e.g.,Web-CAT,
        ASSYST, Marmoset) use code coverage to evaluate how well students test their
        own code. Code coverage measures the percentage of a student\u2019s code\u2014e.g.,
        branches or statements\u2014that are executed from his test cases. It may
        overestimate test quality as executed code may not be checked against expected
        behaviors. Moreover, students frequently submit incomplete and incorrect assignments.
        If a student completes 60% required features and executes all the code from
        his tests, he will achieve 100% coverage. As a result, code coverage calculated
        on incomplete or incorrect solutions will fail to indicate the true quality
        of their tests. Alternatively, we evaluate students\u2019 tests based on how
        many bugs they can detect from other students submissions\u2014known as all-pairs
        testing\u2014and from a correct solution having artificially injected errors
        in it\u2014known as mutation testing. In all-pairs testing a student\u2019s
        tests are run against the other students\u2019 programs. This mechanism gives
        students a greater realization of the density of bugs in their code and their
        ability to write tests that find defects in others\u2019 solutions. Mutation
        analysis seeds artificial errors into code and then checks whether a test
        suite can detect them. Test suites that detect more errors are better than
        those that detect less. Both all-pairs testing and mutation testing have a
        number of technical challenges to apply them in classroom assessment systems.
        We investigate three main research questions in this paper: 1) Is it feasible
        to use all-pairs and mutation testing for evaluation of student-written tests?
        2) Are they better indicators of test quality in terms of defectrevealing
        capability of tests? 3) How effective are student-written tests in finding
        real bugs? We devise novel techniques to address challenges of all-pairs testing
        and mutation analysis and apply them in automated assessment systems. We also
        directly compare all three methods of measuring test quality in terms of how
        well they predict the observed bug revealing capabilities of student-written
        tests when run against a naturally occurring collection of student-produced
        defects. Finally, we investigate quality and pattern of students\u2019 tests.
        Experimental results encompassing over 700,000 test runs show that the all-pairs
        testing approach is the best predictor of defect detection ability of student-written
        tests, while neither code coverage nor mutation analysis scores were significantly
        correlated with defect detection capability. Analyzing the results, we found
        that students write very similar test cases. While they achieved an average
        branch coverage of 95.4% on their own solutions, their test suites were only
        able to detect an average of 13.6% of the faults present in the entire program
        population. Thus, students are na\u00efve \u201chappy path testers\u201d they
        write tests to show that their code \u201cworked\u201d, rather than finding
        errors or faults. 2. BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK To incorporate software testing
        as a part of coding, Goldwasser [1] proposed an idea of requiring students
        to turn in tests along with their solutions, and then running every student\u2019s
        tests against every other\u2019s programs. Embracing this idea, automated
        assessment tools (e.g., Web-CAT, ASSYST, and Marmoset) evaluate student written
        code against instructor\u2019s tests and use some form of coverage analysis
        to assess quality of students\u2019 tests. As tests written in compiled languages,
        such as Java, do not compile against a solution that differs in structure
        from the author\u2019s solution, no capability for all-pairs testing was available.
        Edwards and Shams [3] are the first to provide a practical solution for all-pairs
        testing. Aaltonen et al. [2] proposed using mutation analysis to evaluate
        adequacy of the tests but computational overhead makes it impractical to generate
        real-time feedback and use in classroom assessment tools. We proposed solutions
        for these obstacles and evaluated mutation analysis against an alternative,
        code coverage [4]. 3. UNIQUENESS OF THE APPROACH Our research is conducted
        in three main steps: 1) Overcoming the challenges of all-pairs and mutation
        testing in classroom assessment, 2) Comparing how accurately all-pairs testing,
        mutation testing and code coverage predict defect revealing capability of
        students\u2019 tests, and 3) Analyzing student-written tests to find effectiveness.
        We describe the three steps below. 3.1 Overcoming the challenges of all-pairs
        and mutation testing The main obstacle of using all-pairs testing and mutation
        analysis (when run on buggy versions generated from any solution other than
        the student\u2019s) is the compile-time dependency of the tests on its author\u2019s
        solution. In object-oriented languages, such as Java, tests are written as
        a part of the solution and may refer to any visible or public feature of the
        solution. For example, a student may decide to add a helper method in his
        solution to assist some computation. If a student tests such components that
        arise from his personal design decisions that are not present in others\u2019
        code, then his tests will not compile against others\u2019 or reference solutions.
        We provided a novel way to resolve this issue in Java by transforming the
        student-written tests so that they use reflection to defer binding to specific
        features of a solution until run-time [3]. Test sets can be compiled against
        the particular solution for which they were written. Similarly, instructors
        typically provide their own implementation to double-check reference test
        sets, so instructor-written reference tests will compile against the implementation.
        The byte-code of the compiled test sets are then transformed into reflective
        forms so that they use late binding. This allows the tests to be run against
        any solution, with student-specific test cases failing at run-time because
        of failed reflective method lookups. Reflection is a feature of Java that
        can be used to reduce compiletime dependencies between code components. In
        the previous work [3], we transformed the byte-codes of the test cases using
        Javassist into purely reflective forms. Java reflection can be complicated
        and error-prone to use, but we use ReflectionSupport [5], a library of methods
        that completely encapsulates the details of using reflection underneath a
        powerful, streamlined interface ideal for writing test actions. As a result,
        test cases written using this library will have no compile-time dependencies
        on the software under test. The purely reflective test cases will run against
        any student submission. Individual test cases that depend on features that
        are missing or incorrectly declared in the student\u2019s work fail at runtime,
        while other test cases run normally. Therefore, any test set will run against
        all solutions, even incomplete ones. This strategy of removing compile-time
        dependencies from test sets is a key technique to applying all-pairs testing.
        solution, 2) removing compile time dependencies from students\u2019 tests
        so that they run against the mutants, and 3) automatically detecting if a
        mutant is a true defect or equivalent to the original. Usually, instructors
        write a reference solution, which is presumably correct and includes all the
        required features of the assignment. In earlier work [4], we chose the reference
        solution to generate mutants, so that mutants would cover all required behavior,
        and so that non-equivalent mutants could be considered to truly deviate from
        the required behavior. Mutant generation also takes time that slows down analysis
        of student-written tests. By pre-generating the full set of mutants from the
        reference solution ahead of time, mutant generation does not have to be performed
        for each student submission, so it will not slow down analysis of student-written
        tests. Later, student-written test cases are transformed to remove compile-time
        dependencies. Afterwards, we validate students\u2019 tests by running th",

        tests, this paper reports on an investigation of the quality of student written
        tests in terms of the number of authentic, human-written defects those tests
        can detect. An experiment was conducted using 101 programs written for a CS2
        data structures assignment where students implemented a queue two ways, using
        both an array-based and a link-based representation. Students were required
        to write their own software tests and graded in part on the branch coverage
        they achieved. Using techniques from prior work, we were able to approximate
        the number of bugs present in the collection of student solutions, and identify

        Education", "abstract": "Computer science educators are increasingly using
        interactive learning content to enrich and enhance the pedagogy of their courses.
        A plethora of such learning content, specifically designed for computer science
        education, such as visualization, simulation, and web-based environments for
        learning programming, are now available for various courses. We call such
        content smart learning content. However, such learning content is seldom used
        outside its host site despite the benefits it could offer to learners everywhere.
        In this paper, we investigate the factors that impede dissemination of such
        content among the wider computer science education community. To accomplish
        this we surveyed educators, existing tools and recent research literature
        to identify the current state of the art and analyzed the characteristics
        of a large number of smart learning content examples along canonical dimensions.
        In our analysis we focused on examining the technical issues that must be
        resolved to support finding, integrating and customizing smart learning content
        in computer science courses. Finally, we propose a new architecture for hosting,
        integrating and disseminating smart learning content and discuss how it could
        be implemented based on existing protocols and standards.", "venue": "ITiCSE-WGR",

        materials and tutorials. While there are a number of web-based Python teaching

        examples that instructors can write and students can explore; it provides
        auto-saving of student work in the cloud, with full, transparent version control;

        sounds. Pythy provides a complete ecosystem for student learning, with a user
        interface that follows a more familiar web browsing model, rather than a developer-focused
        IDE interface. An evaluation compares student perceptions of Pythy in relation

        meaningful diagnostics to assist students in tracking down and fixing memory\u2010related

        "title": "Toward practical mutation analysis for evaluating the quality of
        student-written software tests", "abstract": "Software testing is being added
        to programming courses at many schools, but current assessment techniques
        for evaluating student-written tests are imperfect. Code coverage measures
        are typically used in practice, but they have limitations and sometimes overestimate
        the true quality of tests. Others have proposed using mutation analysis instead,
        but mutation analysis poses a number of practical obstacles to classroom use.
        This paper describes a new approach to mutation analysis of student-written
        tests that is more practical for educational use, especially in an automated
        grading context. This approach combines several techniques to produce a novel
        solution that addresses the shortcomings raised by more traditional mutation
        analysis. An evaluation of this approach in the context of both CS1 and CS2
        courses illustrates how it differs from code coverage analysis. At the same
        time, however, the evaluation results also raise questions of concern for
        CS educators regarding the relative value of more comprehensive assessment
        of test quality, the value of more open-ended assignments that offer significant
        design freedom for students, the cost of providing higher-quality reference
        solutions in order to support better quality assessment, and the cost of supporting
        assignments that require more intensive testing, such as GUI assignments.",

        "title": "Reflection Support: Java Reflection Made Easy", "abstract": "Large
        software projects often require the ability to load and manage new code assets
        that were not originally available during system compilation. Moreover, testing
        tools need to inspect and run code components regardless of their structures.
        Reflection in Java supports these tasks by providing programmers with facilities
        to dynamically create objects, invoke methods, access fields, and perform
        code introspection at runtime. These capabilities come at the cost of reduced
        readability and writeability, since code written using Java''s reflection
        classes is clunky, bulky and unintuitive. Common tasks such as object creation,
        method invocation, and field manipulation need to be decomposed into multiple
        steps that require try-catch blocks to guard against checked exceptions. Type
        casts and explicit use of class types as parameters make development and maintenance
        of code difficult, time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we discuss
        the diffi- culties of using reflection in Java. We also present an open-source
        library called ReflectionSupport that addresses these problems and makes reflection
        in Java easier to use. ReflectionSupport provides static helper methods that
        offer the same reflective capabilities but that encapsulate the overhead of
        coding with reflection. This paper focuses on improving the us- ability of
        Java reflection by presenting an API that allows programmers to obtain the
        benefits of reflection without the hassle.", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount":

        The evaluation includes data collected over five years (10 semesters) from
        49,980 programming assignment submissions by 883 different students. To examine
        the effectiveness of software testing behaviors, we investigate the quality
        of their testing at different stages of their development. We partition testing
        behaviors into four groups according to when in their development they first
        achieve substantial (at least 85%) test coverage. The study reveals significant
        results regarding effective and ineffective testing behaviors. A within-subjects
        comparison finds that higher coverage in early development is associated with
        higher quality code and with completing work earlier. Post-hoc analysis also
        suggests that the relationship between early testing and positive outcomes
        is independent of time management and effects of individuals'' abilities.

        quality. If it is used for evaluating students'' code, students will realize
        their ability to write bug free code from professional context. The main issues
        of using bug density for object oriented languages are creating a comprehensive
        test suit, and running them against all solutions as the test cases are written
        as part of solutions may fail to compile against other codes. We provide a
        novel four phase Java specific solution: 1) developing a comprehensive master
        test suit by collecting all the students written valid test cases; 2) transforming
        the test cases to use late binding so that they can run against any solution;
        3) running the entire tests against all the programs and removing redundant
        test suits; and 4) estimating bugs/KSLOC by determining the relationship between
        test case failures in the master suite and latent bugs hidden in student programs.
        The first two phases of this ongoing research are applied to two programming

        This glue code represents individual steps within unit and acceptance test

        paper takes the position that, instead of requiring programmers to write manual
        glue code, it is practical to convert natural language scenario descriptions

        paper presents preliminary results from a tool called Kirby that uses natural
        language processing techniques to automatically generate executable software
        tests from structured English scenario descriptions. Kirby relieves the developer
        from the laborious work of writing code for the individual steps described

        "abstract": "In statically typed object-oriented languages such as Java, GUI
        event handling is traditionally handled through listener interfaces or similar
        types of polymorphic delegation. In the case of events that pass information
        about their source to the handling method, the programmer is required to perform
        runtime type checks to determine the true types of the components involved.
        This produces poorly designed code that contains a second layer of hand-written
        type-based dispatch before events can actually be handled. In this paper we
        present an alternative approach that builds this second dispatch layer into
        the underlying framework. The approach uses run-time reflection and overload
        resolution to automatically distinguish events based on method argument types,
        and to implicitly bind them to the event publishers. This approach combines
        the type safety of a statically typed language with the run-time flexibility
        of modern dynamic languages and enhances the readability of event handling

        "abstract": "Many techniques have been attempted to encourage students to
        exercise better time management on class projects, such as staging an assignment
        into multiple deliverables, requiring students to keep records of the time
        they spend, and offering extra credit for early completion. This paper reports
        on a study of the effects of offering extra credit for early completion. Students
        in an introductory course completed four programming assignments throughout
        the term. For two assignments, no extra credit was offered. For the other
        two, students were offered a 10% bonus if they finished at least three days
        before the deadline. While one might expect this incentive to encourage students
        to shift their work habits, we found that there was no positive change in
        their time management. In fact, students started on the assignments where
        extra credit was offered later than on those where it was not offered. This
        leads us to believe that there were other pressures or concerns that outweigh
        the possibility of earning a bonus on an assignment, so that this kind of
        incentive only helps students who already manage their time well.", "venue":

        life for an old \"gimmick\"", "abstract": "At SIGCSE 2002, Michael Goldwasser
        suggested a strategy for adding software testing practices to programming
        courses by requiring students to turn in tests along with their solutions,
        and then running every student''s tests against every other student''s program.
        This approach provides a much more robust environment for assessing the quality
        of student-written tests, and also provides more thorough testing of student
        solutions. Although software testing is included as a regular part of many
        more programming courses today, the all-pairs model of executing tests is
        still a rarity. This is because student-written tests, such as JUnit tests
        written for Java programs, are now more commonly written in the form of program
        code themselves, and they may depend on virtually any aspect of their author''s
        own solution. These dependencies may keep one student''s tests from even compiling
        against another student''s program. This paper discusses the problem and presents
        a novel solution for Java that uses bytecode rewriting to transform a student''s
        tests into a form that uses reflection to run against any other solution,
        regardless of any compile-time dependencies that may have been present in
        the original tests. Results of applying this technique to two assignments,
        encompassing 147 student programs and 240,158 individual test case runs, shows
        the feasibility of the approach and provides some insight into the quality
        of both student tests and student programs. An analysis of these results is

        "title": "From intuition to evidence: a data-driven approach to transforming
        cs education", "abstract": "Educators in many disciplines are too often forced
        to rely on intuition about how students learn and the effectiveness of teaching
        to guide changes and improvements to their curricula. In computer science,
        systems that perform automated collection and assessment of programming assignments
        are seeing increased adoption, and these systems generate a great deal of
        meaningful intermediate data and statistics during the grading process. Continuous
        collection of these data and long-term retention of collected data present
        educators with a new resource to assess both learning (how well students understand
        a topic or how they behave on assignments) and teaching (how effective a response,
        intervention, or assessment instrument was in evaluating knowledge or changing
        behavior), by basing their decisions on evidence rather than intuition. It
        is only possible to achieve these goals, however, if such data are easily
        accessible. \nI present an infrastructure that has been added to one such
        automated grading system, Web-CAT, in order to facilitate routine data collection
        and access while requiring very little added effort by instructors. Using
        this infrastructure, I present three case studies that serve as representative
        examples of educational questions that can be explored thoroughly using pre-existing
        data from required student work. The first case study examines student time
        management habits and finds that students perform better when they start earlier
        but that offering extra credit for finishing earlier did not encourage them
        to do so. The second case study evaluates a tool used to improve student understanding
        of manual memory management and finds that students made fewer errors when
        using the tool. The third case study evaluates the reference tests used to
        grade student code on a selected assignment and confirms that the tests are
        a suitable instrument for assessing student ability. In each case study, I
        use a data-driven, evidence-based approach spanning multiple semesters and
        students, allowing me to answer each question in greater detail than was possible
        using previous methods and giving me significantly increased confidence in
        my conclusions.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 35, "citationCount":

        have adopted test-driven development practices in their introductory computer
        science courses, as a way of encouraging incremental development and decreasing
        defects in student code. This practice is straightforward for basic data-driven
        objects, but making unit testing of GUI applications approachable for students
        poses a larger challenge. We have previously addressed this problem for Swing
        applications by developing LIFT, a library that allows students to easily
        write JUnit tests for Swing interfaces. Since then, we have transitioned away
        from Swing to Android as the development platform in CS2 to better motivate
        and excite our students about their assignments. To fully support this change,
        we had to ensure that our students could fully test the GUI portions of their
        solutions on that platform as well. The Android operating system has significant
        built-in support for GUI testing, but the standard API is too complex for
        students to use. In order to address this, we developed RoboLIFT, a framework
        that eases the task of writing concise and complete unit tests for Android
        applications. Furthermore, RoboLIFT also has support for automated grading
        on the Web-CAT automated assessment system, so even if instructors do not
        require their students to follow test-driven development practices, they can
        still enjoy the benefits of automated grading by writing correctness tests
        that use RoboLIFT to exercise the students'' graphical user interfaces.",

        in early, object-oriented, computer science courses. To do this, we used peer
        review exercises in two CS2 classes at neighboring universities over the course
        of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing
        the instructor, and one completing small design or coding exercises), we measured
        the students'' attitudes, their perceptions of their abilities, and how many
        of the reviews they completed. We found moderately positive attitudes that
        generally increased over time but were not significantly different between
        groups. We also saw a lower completion rate for students reviewing peers than
        for the other groups. The students'' internal motivation, as measured by their
        need for cognition, was not shown to be strongly related to their attitudes
        nor to the number of assignments completed. Overall, our results show a strong
        need for external motivation to help engage students in peer reviews.", "venue":

        "Algorithm visualizations (AVs) are widely viewed as having the potential
        for improving computer science education. However, the rate of AV use and
        overall impact on education does not match the positive interest in their
        use that instructors report. Surveys of CS faculty show that impediments to
        successful use of AVs in the classroom include difficulties in finding quality
        AVs on desired topics, difficulties in adapting AVs to a given classroom setting,
        and lack of knowledge on the best way to deploy AVs. This indicates a need
        for better support for instructors, to get them past these barriers. We seek
        to provide this support through an online educational community that relies
        on a new model based less on the \"digital library\" approach of information
        gained by going to a site and searching. Instead, the focus is on community-added

        "Beginning programmers often have difficulty interpreting exceptions and using
        the associated messages to pinpoint the cause of incorrect program behavior.
        When an interactive development environment (IDE) presents a novice developer
        with a runtime time exception, it generally provides with a stack trace and
        a limited, cryptic exception message that is hard for a beginner to interpret.
        This paper describes ExceptionDoctor, a Java utility that solves this problem.
        ExceptionDoctor intercepts exceptions thrown by student code and improves
        the embedded exception messages to provide levelappropriate descriptions.
        ExceptionDoctor also examines the source code that produced the exception

        Ensemble has shaped its activities according to principles related to design,

        articulate 8 key principles for distributed portals (PDPs). While our focus

        and enhance the Ensemble R&D and production activities. They allow us to provide
        a broad range of services, from personalization to coordination across communities.
        The eight PDPs can be briefly summarized as: (1) Articulation across communities

        "title": "Peer review in CS2: conceptual learning", "abstract": "In computer
        science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts
        from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to
        experience authentic uses of the concepts in a non-programming manner. In
        this work, we examine the use of the peer review process in early, object-oriented,
        computer science courses as a way to develop the reviewers'' knowledge of
        object-oriented programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition,
        and Encapsulation.\n To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in
        two CS2 classes at local universities over the course of a semester. Using
        three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and
        one completing small design or coding exercises), we measured the students''
        conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the
        reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition,
        especially those reviewing the instructor''s programs. Overall, peer reviews
        are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be
        used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented programming concepts.",

        key goal of entry level computer science classes is the recruitment and retention
        of potential computer science graduates. Many entry level classes struggle
        to show students the real world context and social and societal impact of
        computer science. Modern Web 2.0 applications provide an attractive way of
        putting computer science in a realistic context. However, efforts to teach
        such applications in a first CS course are hampered by the fact that they
        require a deep understanding of multiple and complex concepts and technologies.
        Rather than focusing on learning core computer science concepts, students
        would need to learn transient and technology-specific knowledge. This paper
        presents the initial design of CloudSpace, a teaching environment that allows
        students to understand core computer science concepts in the context of modern
        web applications. CloudSpace presents entry-level CS students with a virtual
        environment to develop web applications in a manner similar to the development
        process of desktop user interface applications. For example, CloudSpace allows
        students to work with abstractions such as a console and or a file system
        that mimic the environment in which traditional programs run. This virtual
        environment also shields students from the distributed nature of the web technologies
        with which they work. To populate these virtual environments with real-world
        data, CloudSpace will be equipped with API''s to access data from the Internet.
        CloudSpace will feature a rich library for accessing RSS feeds, on-line video
        clips, on-line CSV data sources, and generic web page content. Rather than
        working with dull datasets, this library allows students to integrate real-world
        and life data sources into their applications.", "venue": "", "year": 2010,

        "abstract": "Algorithm visualizations (AVs) are widely viewed as having the
        potential for improving computer science education, yet the rate of AV use
        and overall impact has progressed little from the mid 1990s. Surveys of CS
        faculty [1] show that the impediments to successful use of AVs are related
        to difficulties in first finding good materials, and then difficulties in
        effectively deploying them in classes. Fortunately, much progress has been
        made in recent years. There are many high-quality AVs available (though there
        are enough poor quality AVs that sorting out the good ones can be time consuming)
        [2]. There is a growing body of research on how to effectively use AVs in
        the classroom (though getting up to speed on this information is again time
        consuming). These impediments could be overcome with adequate dissemination
        of information about which AVs are of good quality and how they can best be
        used. From the developers\u2019 side, more information about what makes for
        an effective AV, as well as information about which topics are of greatest
        need, could lead to more effective AVs being produced. Thus, we find that
        information and dissemination of best practice plays a key role in the successful
        deployment of AVs into the classroom. Given that much of the needed information
        has to do with rating of educational material and experiences with use of
        this material in the field, the most effective way to improve instruction
        is through an active community of AV users and developers interacting to provide
        the necessary information.", "venue": "Technical Symposium on Computer Science

        of data collected in the first three programming courses at Virginia Tech.
        The dataset involves a total of 89,879 assignment submissions by 1,101 different
        students. Assignment results were partitioned into two groups: scores above
        80% (A/B) and scores below 80% (C/D/F). To investigate student behaviors that
        result in differing levels of achievement, all students who consistently received
        A/B scores and all students who consistently received C/D/F scores were removed
        from the dataset. A within-subjects comparison of the scores received by the
        remaining individuals was performed. Further, time and code-size data that
        is difficult to compare directly between different courses was normalized.\n
        This study revealed several significant results. When students received A/B
        scores, they started earlier and finished earlier than when the same students
        received C/D/F scores. They also wrote slightly more program code. They did
        not appear to spend any more time on their work, however. Approximately two-thirds
        of the A/B scores were received by individuals who started more than a day
        in advance of the deadline, while approximately two-thirds of the C/D/F scores
        were received by individuals who started on the last day or later. One possible
        explanation is that students who start earlier simply have more time to seek
        assistance when they get stuck.", "venue": "International Computing Education

        "Dynamic memory management and the use of pointers are critical topics in
        teaching the C++ language. They are also some of the most difficult for students
        to grasp properly. The responsibility of ensuring that students understand
        these concepts does not end with the instructor''s lectures---a library enhanced
        with diagnostics beyond those provided by the language''s run-time system
        itself is a useful tool for giving students more detailed information when
        their code fails.\n We have designed such a toolkit, Dereferee, which students
        can incorporate into their code with minimal intrusion into the learning process.
        To demonstrate its effectiveness, we examine C++ code from students in a course
        that relied solely on the built-in memory management behavior of the language,
        without any significant additional diagnostic or debugging facilities. We
        instrument this code with Dereferee in order to explore the causes of errors

        Creating a mechanism for data sharing in computer science education research

        in connection with SIGCSE 2008. We outline the advantages and challenges of
        developing a repository, show how the challenges have been addressed by repositories

        Rich Reporting Capabilities", "abstract": "Programs that perform automated
        assignment grading can generate a great deal of meaningful data not only for
        the student, but for the instructor as well. Such tools are often used in
        computer science courses to assess student programming work. In the process
        of grading, a large amount of intermediate information is gathered. However,
        in most cases this information is not used beyond assigning scores, so the
        potential of learning more about the course is lost. At the same time, continuous
        collection of data over a large number of submissions across many courses
        presents an interesting but untapped resource for educational data mining.
        One solution to this problem is to implement a reporting tool for making use
        of this intermediate data to create meaningful interpretations. This paper
        describes how an automated grading system, WebCAT, has been extended to provide
        a reporting mechanism that uses the intermediate data that is gathered during
        assessment of students\u2019 programs. Our implementation of the reporting

        work in developing student assignments has involved making use of online data
        resources to make them more interesting and to give students real world information
        to interact with in some manner. While definitely a practical approach, the
        work that has been done so far is either for \"CS0\" courses targeted at non-majors,
        often using tools like Microsoft Excel, or courses that require a level of
        skill at programming from the students. Additionally, existing tools are specific
        to a particular structure of the data (CSV, XML, and others). As a result,
        these constraints make on-line real-world data sets difficult to use in typical
        introductory programming courses for majors.\n Objects-first approaches to
        teaching introductory programming advocate the use of objects early on. Consequently,
        students are able to take advantage of using data types early on. We have
        created an interface that allows students to access real-world data sets from
        online (or local) sources in a uniform fashion. This abstraction allows students
        with minimal programming experience to load, process, and manipulate external
        data sets in a variety of formats. We also developed a lab assignment where
        students accessed an online CSV data source to demonstrate feasibility and
        to gain experience with classroom use of this approach.", "venue": "Annual

        like JUnit and its relatives are making software testing reachable even for
        introductory students. At the same time, however, many introductory computer
        sciences courses use graphical interfaces as an \"attention grabber\" for
        students and as a metaphor for teaching object-oriented programming. Unfortunately,
        developing software tests for programs that have significant graphical user
        interfaces is beyond the abilities of typical students (and, for that matter,
        many educators). This paper describes a framework for combining readily available
        tools to create an infrastructure for writing tests for Java programs that
        have graphical user interfaces. These tests are level-appropriate for introductory
        students and fit in with current approaches in computer science education
        that incorporate testing in programming assignments. An analysis of data collected
        during actual student use of the framework in a CS1 course is presented.",

        "abstract": "Computer science educators spend a lot of effort designing programming
        assignments, and many are willing to share the results of this investment.
        However, sharing of programming assignments occurs primarily in an ad hoc
        manner through informal channels. There are no widely used mechanisms that
        support instructors in finding and sharing such resources. Often, the additional
        work required to prepare and self-publish assignment resources in a way that
        others can then adapt or reuse is a significant inhibitor. Also, other instructors
        may have to spend an inordinate amount of time and effort to reshape a potential
        assignment into something that can be used in their own courses. This working
        group report proposes a common format for packaging assignments for sharing.
        This format is easy for instructors to create (requiring no specialized tools),
        is extensible and flexible enough to handle assignments written for any programming
        language at any level of proficiency, supports appropriate metadata, and is
        easily manipulated by software tools. As more and more instructors use automated
        grading tools to process student submissions, it is our hope that such an
        interchange format can lead to a community practice of sharing resources in
        a way that overcomes existing barriers to such reuse.", "venue": "SIGCSE Bulletin

        Checks in .Net Components", "abstract": "In component-based systems, there
        are several obstacles to using Design by Contract (DbC), particularly with
        respect to third-party components. Contracts are particularly valuable when
        debugging or testing composite software structures that include third-party
        components. However, existing approaches have critical weaknesses. First,
        existing approaches typically require a component''s source code to be available
        if you wish to strip (or re-insert) checks. Second, documentation of the contract
        is either distributed separately from the component or embedded in the component''s
        source code. Third, enabling and disabling specific kinds of checks on separate
        components from independent vendors can be a significant challenge. This paper
        describes an approach to representing contracts for .NET components using
        attributes. This contract information can be retrieved from the compiled component''s
        metadata and used for many purposes. The paper also describes nContract, a
        tool that automatically generates run-time checks from embedded contracts.
        Such run-time checks can be generated and added to a system without requiring
        source code access or recompilation. Further, when checks for a given component
        are excluded, they impose no run-time overhead. Finally, a highly expressive,
        fine-grained mechanism for controlling user preferences about which specific

        "The Web-CAT software system for evaluating student programming assignments
        has had substantial impact both within Virginia Tech and in other universities.
        Web-CAT, the Web-based Center for Automated Testing, is a tool that provides
        rapid, directed comments on student work, encourages students to write software
        tests for their own work, and empowers students with the responsibility of
        demonstrating the correctness and validity of their own programs. Web-CAT
        has allowed Dr. Edwards to transform the way programming assignments are given
        and assessed in our freshman and sophomore CS programming courses. While students
        have always focused on \u201cwriting code,\u201d Web-CAT has given instructors
        a tool that encourages students to step back and reflect on their own work
        and what they are trying to achieve. Web-CAT does not grade student programs
        for correctness\u2014instead, the student is responsible for demonstrating
        correctness by writing and running test cases. Each test case is a minihypothesis
        about how the student believes his or her program should work, and students
        continually write, refine, and experimentally validate these hypotheses as
        they develop solutions. Web-CAT then grades students on how well they test
        their own programs, that is, how rigorous and convincing is their own demonstration
        of the correctness of their own work. As a result, students learn more and
        produce higher-quality code. Students who use Web-CAT produce an average of
        28% fewer program bugs, are more likely to turn their work in on time, and
        receive higher scores. Further, students see clear benefits to using Web-CAT,
        since it increases their confidence in the correctness of their own work,
        helps them incrementally develop solutions, and reduces some of the most frustrating
        factors that cause students to fail to complete working solutions. The lessons
        learned from these development efforts have been disseminated through journal
        articles, conference papers, demonstrations, poster presentations, workshop
        papers, and four tutorials at national conferences.", "venue": "", "year":

        Research Articles", "abstract": "In design by contract (DBC), assertions are
        typically written using program variables and query methods. The lack of separation
        between program code and assertions is confusing, because readers do not know
        what code is intended for use in the program and what code is only intended
        for specification purposes. This lack of separation also creates a potential
        runtime performance penalty, even when runtime assertion checks are disabled,
        due to both the increased memory footprint of the program and the execution
        of code maintaining that part of the program''s state intended for use in
        specifications. To solve these problems, we present a new way of writing and
        checking DBC assertions without directly referring to concrete program states,
        using \u2018model\u2019, i.e. specification-only, variables and methods. The
        use of model variables and methods does not incur the problems mentioned above,
        but it also allow one to write more easily assertions that are abstract, concise,
        and independent of representation details, and hence more readable and maintainable.
        We implemented these features in the runtime assertion checker for the Java
        Modeling Language (JML), but the approach could also be implemented in other
        DBC tools. Copyright \u00a9 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "venue": "", "year":

        Systems", "abstract": "Multithreaded programs are notoriously difficult to
        verify: the interleaving of concurrent threads causes an exponential explosion
        of the control state, and if threads can be dynamically created, the number
        of control states is unbounded. A classical thread-modular approach to verification
        is to consider the system as composed of a \u201cmain\u201d thread and a context
        which is an abstraction of all the other \u201cenvironment\u201d threads of
        the system, and to then verify that (a) that this composed system is safe
        (\u201cassume\u201d), and, (b) that the context is indeed a sound abstraction
        (\u201cguarantee\u201d). Once the appropriate context has been divined, the
        above checks can be discharged by existing methods. Previously, such a context
        had to be provided manually, and if the given context is imprecise, then either
        check may fail leaving us with no information about whether the system is
        safe or not. We show how to automate the thread-modular approach by: (a) finding
        a model for the context that is simultaneously (i) abstract enough to permit
        efficient checking and (ii) precise enough to preclude false positives as
        well as yield real error traces when the checks fail, and (b) showing how
        to infer such a context automatically. We give a novel way to construct stateful
        contexts, by representing individual environment threads as abstract finite
        state machines, and tracking arbitrarily many threads by counting the number
        of threads at each abstract state. We infer stateful contexts by iteratively
        weakening the abstract reachability analysis used for sequential programs,
        until an appropriate context is obtained. We have implemented this algorithm
        in our C model checker BLAST, and used it to look for race conditions on networked
        embedded systems applications written in NesC, which use non-trivial synchronization
        idioms, that cause previous, imprecise analyses to race false alarms. We were

        "title": "minimUML: A minimalist approach to UML diagramming for early computer
        science education", "abstract": "In introductory computer science courses,
        the Unified Modeling Language (UML) is commonly used to teach basic object-oriented
        design. However, there appears to be a lack of suitable software to support
        this task. Many of the available programs that support UML focus on developing
        code and not on enhancing learning. Programs designed for educational use
        sometimes have poor interfaces or are missing common and important features
        such as multiple selection and undo/redo. Hence the need for software that
        is tailored to an instructional environment and that has all the useful and
        needed functionality for that specific task. This is the purpose of minimUML.
        It provides a minimum amount of UML, just what is commonly used in beginning
        programming classes, and a simple, usable interface. In particular, minimUML
        is designed to support abstract design while supplying features for exploratory
        learning and error avoidance. It supports functionality that includes multiple
        selection, undo/redo, flexible printing, cut and paste, and drag and drop.
        In addition, it allows for the annotation of diagrams, through text or free-form
        drawings, so students can receive feedback on their work. minimUML was developed
        with the goals of supporting ease of use, of supporting novice students, and
        of requiring no prior training for its use. This article presents the rationale
        behind the minimUML design, a description of the tool, and the results of
        usability evaluations and student feedback on the use of the tool.", "venue":

        "abstract": "In design by contract (DBC), assertions are typically written
        using program variables and query methods. The lack of separation between
        program code and assertions is confusing, because readers do not know what
        code is intended for use in the program and what code is only intended for
        specification purposes. This lack of separation also creates a potential runtime
        performance penalty, even when runtime assertion checks are disabled, due
        to both the increased memory footprint of the program and the execution of
        code maintaining that part of the program''s state intended for use in specifications.
        To solve these problems, we present a new way of writing and checking DBC
        assertions without directly referring to concrete program states, using \u2018model\u2019,
        i.e. specification\u2010only, variables and methods. The use of model variables
        and methods does not incur the problems mentioned above, but it also allow
        one to write more easily assertions that are abstract, concise, and independent
        of representation details, and hence more readable and maintainable. We implemented
        these features in the runtime assertion checker for the Java Modeling Language
        (JML), but the approach could also be implemented in other DBC tools. Copyright

        "title": "Designing a Programming Language to Provide Automated Self-testing
        for Formally Specified Software Components", "abstract": "Writing software
        is an error-prone activity. Compilers help detect some of these errors: syntactic
        mistakes plus those semantic mistakes that can be detected through the type
        system. However, locating faults beyond those detectable by the compiler (and
        other static analysis tools) is often relegated to the programmer, who must
        write thorough tests to ensure confidence in the correctness of the software.
        Although the specification and verification community has traditionally focused
        on decreasing software bugs by static verification, research has increasingly
        explored the dynamic analysis of the conformance of software components to
        its specifications. That is, researchers are investigating systems that can
        tell us whether a program\u2019s behavior is consistent with its specification
        while the program is being executed. While dynamic techniques do not offer
        the same degree of assurance as full static verification, they may provide
        useful pragmatic benefits without the human intervention needed by currrent
        generation verification tools. When interpreted as a testing technique, dynamic
        analysis offers us a glimpse of future testing tools that offer another line
        of automatic error detection that augments the compiler, and helps the programmer
        reduce the number of tests he has to write. Modern unit testing tools such
        as JUnit allow some automation of the testing process. Specifically, they
        allow the automated execution of tests. The job of writing tests remains the
        responsibility of the programmer. In writing a test for a software component,
        the programmer must a. exercise a component such that a bug is likely to manifest;
        and b. write code to detect the bug. Current research suggests that the use
        of formal specifications, coupled with the right infrastructure, may alleviate
        much of the tedious process of writing the tests. For example, JML-JUnit [?]
        removes the need to write code that detects a component failure. It can act
        as a test-", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        of interface contract violations can occur in component-based software: A
        client component can fail to satisfy a requirement of a component it is using,
        or a component implementation can fail to fulfill its obligations to the client.
        The traditional approach to detecting and reporting such violations is to
        embed assertion checks into component source code, with compile-time control
        over whether they are enabled. This works well for the original component
        developers, but it fails to meet the needs of component clients who do not
        have access to source code for such components. A wrapper-based approach,
        in which contract checking is not hard-coded into the underlying component
        but is \"layered\" on top of it, offers several relative advantages. It is
        practical and effective for C++ classes. Checking code can be distributed
        in binary form along with the underlying component, it can be installed or
        removed without requiring recompilation of either the underlying component
        or the client code, it can be selectively enabled or disabled by the component
        client on a per-component basis, and it does not require the client to have
        access to any special tools (which might have been used by the component developer)

        "abstract": "Despite our best efforts and intentions as educators, student
        programmers continue to struggle in acquiring comprehension and analysis skills.
        Students believe that once a program runs on sample data, it is correct; most
        programming errors are reported by the compiler; when a program misbehaves,
        shuffling statements and tweaking expressions to see what happens is the best
        debugging approach. This paper presents a new vision for computer science
        education centered around the use of test-driven development in all programming
        assignments, from the beginning of CS1. A key element to the strategy is comprehensive,
        automated evaluation of student work, in terms of correctness, the thoroughness
        and validity of the student''s tests, and an automatic coding style assessment
        performed using industrial-strength tools. By systematically applying the
        strategy across the curriculum as part of a student''s regular programming
        activities, and by providing rapid, concrete, useful feedback that students
        find valuable, it is possible to induce a cultural shift in how students behave.",

        "title": "Applying Object-Oriented Techniques in Embedded Software Design",
        "abstract": "Efficiency is a major concern for real-time systems. Realtime
        software is often written in assembly or other low level languages like C.
        Programmers hesitate to use newer objectoriented techniques since these are
        perceived as less efficient. This work explores the OO design techniques for
        embedded operating system, taking into account real-time goals so that the
        design is efficient and meets system deadlines. The embedded system kernel
        being designed is based on Dataflow Architecture. This architecture, which
        supports asynchronous communication amongst the various components through
        communication channels, was chosen since it addresses the objectives of modularity,
        standardization and reusability of Power Electronics Building Block (PEBB)
        systems, by the use of Elementary Control Objects (ECOs). An ECO is a functional
        entity in the PEBB system that can be used independent of the system details,
        in a variety of systems. It thereby serves as a modular, standardized and
        reusable component. An entity like the ECO comes across as ideal to be modeled
        and implemented as an object; i.e., using the OO approach. More over, since
        the advantages of objectorientation are in line with our objectives of modularity,
        standardization and reusability, it is ideal to implement the system as an
        object-oriented one. For instance, an ECO can be represented by a class. If
        this class is used to represent the general attributes and certain generic
        functions of all ECOs, then we can inherit specific types of ECOs from this
        class, that differ in their implementation code due to their functional differences.
        The ECOs are connected with each other to form the required PEBB system, and
        communicate with each other through communication channels, known as Data
        Channels since they carry data between ECOs to facilitate inter-ECO data flows.
        The Data Channels are also represented by classes. Data Channel objects differ
        in their type based on the type of data that they carry. ECOs operate based
        on Firing Rules. A firing rule is a set of priority firing masks, each of
        which defines one of the possibilities that will cause an ECO to \u201cfire\u201d
        or begin operation. A firing mask is a bit pattern that has bits set in positions
        corresponding to input data channels that need to have data for the ECO to
        fire and a priority firing mask is the combination of a firing mask and an
        integer priority representing the priority that the ECO will acquire when
        it gets triggered by that mask. The paper discusses the design of the object-oriented
        kernel and comparisons of the C version of the kernel (DARK \u2013 Dataflow
        Architecture Real-time Kernel) and its C++ version, DARK++. The following
        section gives an insight into the performance problems that object-oriented
        systems pose and the reasons for them. Section III describes the OO design
        of DARK++. Section 1V does a comparison of the C and the C++ kernels. The
        paper concludes with the most important lessons learnt so far from the research
        and a brief note on the future work.", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount":

        software", "abstract": "Two kinds of interface contract violations can occur
        in component based software: a client component may fail to satisfy a requirement
        of a component it is using, or a component implementation may fail to fulfil
        its obligations to the client. The paper proposes a systematic approach for
        detecting both kinds of violations, so that violation detection is not hard
        coded into base level components, but is \"layered\" on top of them, and so
        that it can be turned \"on\" or \"off\" selectively for one or more components,
        with practically no change to executable code (limiting changes to a few declarations).
        Among the salient features of this approach are its use of formal specifications,
        the ability to handle parameterized (i.e., generic, or template) components,
        and the automatic generation of routine aspects of violation detection. We
        have designed, built, and experimented with a generator of checking components

        "title": "Software Component Relationships", "abstract": "component X extends
        abstract component Y , concrete component X1 implements X, and concrete component
        Y 1 implements Y, then X1 is behaviorally substitutable for Y 1 with respect
        to Y . Note that Y 1 is not behaviorally substitutable for X1 with respect
        to X in this case. Thus behavioral substitutability is a ternary relationship,
        not a binary equivalence relation. To some readers, the extends relationship
        may sound very much like an inheritance relationship. It is important to understand
        that extends is not an inheritance relationship. Extends describes a behavioral
        relationship between two components. Inherits-from does not. Furthermore,
        while inheritance may be a convenient programming language mechanism for expressing
        structural aspects of the extends relationship, extends may be encoded in
        programming languages without any use of inheritance. 3 Comparison Perhaps
        the most widely known work which includes de nitions of software component
        relationships is that by Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and James Rumbaugh on
        the Uni ed Modeling Language (UML). The UML includes software component relationships
        in the form of class relationships dened in Booch''s method for object-oriented
        analysis and design [4]. Booch identi es three basic kinds of class relationships:
        those expressing is-a relationships, those expressing is-a-part-of relationships,
        and association relationships which denote some semantic dependency between
        otherwise unrelated classes. The speci c class relationships used by Booch
        include association, inheritance, aggregation, and using. The meanings of
        these relationships are largely in uenced by available programming language
        mechanisms (in particular, those of C++). Booch''s association relationship
        is primarily useful for design and analysis of a particular application or
        composition of components. It does not convey information about what compositions
        are possible for a reusable component. Booch''s use of the inheritance relationship
        is limited to expressing is-a relationships. However, his de nition of is-a
        is not strict enough to imply behavioral substitutability with respect to
        some speci cation (as does implements). Thus the component relationships expressed
        as class relationships in the UML appear to su er from all of the problems
        described in the last section. Some object-oriented programming advocates
        such as Bertrand Meyer do not insist that inheritance only be used to express
        the conceptual is-a relationship. Meyer has described twelve di erent component
        relationships that may be expressed using inheritance, only one of which expresses
        the is-a relationship [5]. As with the UML''s use of inheritance, Meyer''s
        is-a use of inheritance is not de ned precisely enough to imply behavioral
        substitutability. Some researchers have studied precisely de ned class relationships
        which do imply behavioral substitutability of components [6, 7]. This research
        largely focuses on how the inheritance language mechanism can and should be
        used in a manner that supports reasoning about program behavior. Unlike our
        research, this work does not address conceptual component relationships from
        a language-independent perspective. References [1] M. Sitaraman and B. W.

        "abstract": "There are two approaches to using code inheritance for defining
        new component implementations in terms of existing implementations. Black-box
        code inheritance allows subclasses to reuse superclass implementations as-is,
        without direct access to their internals. Alternatively, white-box code inheritance
        allows subclasses to have direct access to superclass implementation details,
        which may be necessary for the efficiency of some subclass operations. Unfortunately,
        white-box code inheritance violates the protection that encapsulation affords
        to superclasses, opening up the possibility of a subclass interfering with
        the correct operation of its superclass methods. Representation inheritance
        is proposed as a restricted form of white-box code inheritance where subclasses
        have direct access to superclass implementation details, but are required
        to respect the representation invariant(s) and abstraction relation(s) of
        their ancestor(s). This preserves the protection that encapsulation provides,

        "abstract": "Two important objectives when designing a specification for a
        reusable software component are understandability and utility. For a typical
        component defining a new abstract data type, a significant common factor affecting
        both of these objectives is the choice of a mathematical model of the (state

        "title": "The Effects of Layering and Encapsulation on Software Development
        Cost and Quality", "abstract": "Software engineers often espouse the importance
        of using abstraction and encapsulation in developing software components.
        They advocate the \"layering\" of new components on top of existing components,
        using only information about the functionality and interfaces provided by
        the existing components. This layering approach is in contrast to a \"direct
        implementation\" of new components, utilizing unencapsulated access to the
        representation data structures and code present in the existing components.
        By increasing the reuse of existing components, the layering approach intuitively
        should result in reduced development costs, and in increased quality for the
        new components. However, there is no empirical evidence that indicates whether
        the layering approach improves developer productivity or component quality.
        We discuss three controlled experiments designed to gather such empirical
        evidence. The results support the contention that layering significantly reduces
        the effort required to build new components. Furthermore, the quality of the
        components, in terms of the number of defects introduced during their development,
        is at least as good using the layered approach. Experiments such as these
        illustrate a number of interesting and important issues in statistical analysis.
        We discuss these issues because, in our experience, they are not well known
        to software engineers. >", "venue": "IEEE Trans. Software Eng.", "year": 1995,

        "title": "A formal model of software subsystems", "abstract": "People form
        internal mental models of the things they interact with in order to understand
        those interactions. This psychological insight has been used by the human-computer
        interaction (HCI) community to build computer systems that are more intuitive
        for end users, but it has not yet been applied to the problems of software
        designers, programmers, and maintainers. In fact, conventional programming
        languages do little to help client programmers develop good mental models
        of software subsystems. \nThe main problem is that the conventional wisdom
        that software modules are merely a syntactic mechanism for organizing declarations
        and controlling visibility is wrong. This skewed view of the nature of software
        modules limits their utility as effective building-blocks for creating large,
        complex software systems that are comprehensible to human readers. To constitute
        effective building-blocks, modules must present simple mental models to the
        software professionals involved in assembling them into larger modules, and
        ultimately into complete software systems. Because a module has no real semantic
        denotation of its own, there is no way for one to imagine such building-blocks
        as contributing to the understandability of the software comprising them.
        \nThis dissertation presents the basic concepts of the ACTI model (Abstract
        and Concrete Templates and Instances), a theoretical model of software structure
        and meaning that addresses these concerns formally. ACTI supports the assignment
        of useful semantic denotations to software subsystems (building-blocks). Further,
        these assigned semantics can present models of each subsystem that are much
        simpler to understand than a straightforward composition of the lower-level
        parts from which the subsystem is constructed. \nIn addition, ACTI is a mathematically
        formal, language-independent model of software components that captures a
        unifying conceptual view of software architecture embedded in modern module-structured
        languages. Here, the term \"software component\" refers to a reusable software
        subsystem, where a subsystem can vary in grain size from a single module up
        to a large scale generic architecture. It also unifies the module-structured
        and object-oriented views of what a software component is, and successfully
        integrates the key features of inheritance with parameterized programming.",

        constraints, such as number of crew, as well as mandates to minimize surface
        infrastructure as much as possible and to incorporate nuclear transportation
        options. The resulting MAT-developed concept, referred to here as the Strategic
        Analysis Cycle 2021 (SAC21) architecture, leverages Artemis elements and emerging
        commercial capabilities for cargo and logistics launches, and features a hybrid
        Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP)/Chemical transportation system able to complete
        the 1.8 billion kilometer round-trip journey to Mars and back in 760 to 850
        days transit time for the 2039 Earth departure opportunity. Three Mars Descent
        Systems (MDS), each capable of landing about 25 metric tons of useful cargo
        on the surface of Mars, would be pre-deployed in advance of crew departure
        from Earth; two of these MDS''s would deliver a partially fueled Mars Ascent
        Vehicle (MAV), a fission power system, surface mobility, and additional MAV
        propellant. To minimize surface infrastructure, only two of the four Mars
        crew would descend and live in an MDS-landed pressurized rover, exploring
        the martian surface for 30 martian days, or sols, before returning to Mars
        orbit aboard their MAV and rejoining the other two crew on the Deep Space
        Transport for the Earth return voyage. Specifics of many of these architecture
        elements are detailed in separate technical publications; this paper outlines
        the end-to-end integrated architecture performance and concept of operations,
        including synergies with Artemis lunar architecture elements. It is important
        to note that NASA does not have a formal human Mars program and no decisions
        have been made; the architecture described here is intended to fill in an
        often-overlooked corner of the trade space, helping to complete the menu of
        options available to decision-makers as they chart the course for humans to
        Mars.", "venue": "IEEE Aerospace Conference", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Augmenting Parametric Optimal Ascent Trajectory Modeling with Graph
        Theory", "abstract": "It has been well documented that decisions made in the
        early stages of Conceptual and Pre-Conceptual design commit up to 80% of total
        Life-Cycle Cost (LCC) while engineers know the least about the product they
        are designing [1]. Once within Preliminary and Detailed design however, making
        changes to the design becomes far more difficult to enact in both cost and
        schedule. Primarily this has been due to a lack of detailed data usually uncovered
        later during the Preliminary and Detailed design phases. In our current budget-constrained
        environment, making decisions within Conceptual and Pre-Conceptual design
        which minimize LCC while meeting requirements is paramount to a program''s
        success. Within the arena of launch vehicle design, optimizing the ascent
        trajectory is critical for minimizing the costs present within such concerns
        as propellant, aerodynamic, aeroheating, and acceleration loads while meeting
        requirements such as payload delivered to a desired orbit. In order to optimize
        the vehicle design its constraints and requirements must be known, however
        as the design cycle proceeds it is all but inevitable that the conditions
        will change. Upon that change, the previously optimized trajectory may no
        longer be optimal, or meet design requirements. The current paradigm for adjusting
        to these updates is generating point solutions for every change in the design''s
        requirements [2]. This can be a tedious, time-consuming task as changes in
        virtually any piece of a launch vehicle''s design can have a disproportionately
        large effect on the ascent trajectory, as the solution space of the trajectory
        optimization problem is both non-linear and multimodal [3]. In addition, an
        industry standard tool, Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST),
        requires an expert analyst to produce simulated trajectories that are feasible
        and optimal [4]. In a previous publication the authors presented a method
        for combatting these challenges [5]. In order to bring more detailed information
        into Conceptual and Pre-Conceptual design, knowledge of the effects originating
        from changes to the vehicle must be calculated. In order to do this, a model
        capable of quantitatively describing any vehicle within the entire design
        space under consideration must be constructed. This model must be based upon
        analysis of acceptable fidelity, which in this work comes from POST. Design
        space interrogation can be achieved with surrogate modeling, a parametric,
        polynomial equation representing a tool. A surrogate model must be informed
        by data from the tool with enough points to represent the solution space for
        the chosen number of variables with an acceptable level of error. Therefore,
        Design Of Experiments (DOE) is used to select points within the design space
        to maximize information gained on the design space while minimizing number
        of data points required. To represent a design space with a non-trivial number
        of variable parameters the number of points required still represent an amount
        of work which would take an inordinate amount of time via the current paradigm
        of manual analysis, and so an automated method was developed. The best practices
        of expert trajectory analysts working within NASA Marshall''s Advanced Concepts
        Office (ACO) were implemented within a tool called multiPOST. These practices
        include how to use the output data from a previous run of POST to inform the
        next, determining whether a trajectory solution is feasible from a real-world
        perspective, and how to handle program execution errors. The tool was then
        augmented with multiprocessing capability to enable analysis on multiple trajectories
        simultaneously, allowing throughput to scale with available computational
        resources. In this update to the previous work the authors discuss issues
        with the method and solutions.", "venue": "", "year": 2016, "referenceCount":

        due to a combination of uncertainty and shifting requirements. To stay relevant
        in this fluid time, trade studies must also be performed rapidly. In order
        to drive down analysis time while improving the information gained by these
        studies, surrogate models can be created to represent the complex output of
        a tool or tools within a specified tradespace. In order to create this model
        however, a large amount of data must be collected in a short amount of time.
        By this method, the historical approach of relying on subject matter experts
        to generate the data required is schedule infeasible. However, by implementing
        automation and distributed analysis the required data can be generated in
        a fraction of the time. Previous work focused on setting up a tool called
        multiPOST capable of orchestrating many simultaneous runs of an analysis tool
        assessing these automated analyses utilizing heuristics gleaned from the best
        practices of current subject matter experts. In this update to the previous

        the results of the partnership between the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory
        (ASDL) at theGeorgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) and the Office
        of Naval Research (ONR) in continuing the development of advanced design methods
        and their application to revolutionary concepts. The methods pioneered include
        but are not limited to surrogate modeling in design applications, optimization,
        robust design simulation , strategic portfolio planning, technology impact
        forecasting and evaluation, as well as inverse design methods and capability-based
        design concepts. Prior funding has focused on developing the methods while
        actual applications have been incomplete and applied to simplified demonstration
        problems; The difficulty lies in that these prior applications are often done
        under strict non-disclosure agreements, therefore the findings cannot be published
        and shared. This highlights the need to apply ASDL methods to real world problems.
        The researchers have identified various problems that span the full spectrum
        of processes, methods and techniques developed at ASDL and are significantly
        different to ensure the broad applicability of the methods. These problem
        areas include ship design, Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD), Command and Control

        "title": "Capturing the Global Feasible Design Space for Launch Vehicle Ascent
        Trajectories", "abstract": "A common approach to solving infinite dimensional
        optimal control problems, such as in launch vehicle trajectory optimization,
        is to approximate the optimal control function as a set of parameters. This
        process, known as the direct method, transcribes the optimal control problem
        into a finite dimensional parameter optimization problem. Traditionally, subject
        matter experts and trajectory analysts work manually to find usable trajectories
        by changing the initial guess for the control parameters. This paper presents
        a method to capture the feasible design space of a launch vehicle trajectory
        problem. The result is a region of feasible values for the launch vehicle
        control parameters. In this context, feasibility is defined by the trajectory
        reaching the termination criteria, thereby returning a function evaluation.
        The method is applied to a Delta IV Medium launch vehicle. This vehicle is
        used because it represents the challenges of trajectory optimization for ETO
        launch vehicles while not being overly complex. Two ways of sampling the control
        parameter design space to determine feasibility are compared. Results are
        represented using design variable limits and the global feasible space is

        "title": "An Expert System-Driven Method for Parametric Trajectory Optimization
        During Conceptual Design", "abstract": "During the early phases of engineering
        design, the costs committed are high, costs incurred are low, and the design
        freedom is high. It is well documented that decisions made in these early
        design phases drive the entire design''s life cycle cost. In a traditional
        paradigm, key design decisions are made when little is known about the design.
        As the design matures, design changes become more difficult in both cost and
        schedule to enact. The current capability-based paradigm, which has emerged
        because of the constrained economic environment, calls for the infusion of
        knowledge usually acquired during later design phases into earlier design
        phases, i.e. bringing knowledge acquired during preliminary and detailed design
        into pre-conceptual and conceptual design. An area of critical importance
        to launch vehicle design is the optimization of its ascent trajectory, as
        the optimal trajectory will be able to take full advantage of the launch vehicle''s
        capability to deliver a maximum amount of payload into orbit. Hence, the optimal
        ascent trajectory plays an important role in the vehicle''s affordability
        posture yet little of the information required to successfully optimize a
        trajectory is known early in the design phase. Thus, the current paradigm
        of optimizing ascent trajectories involves generating point solutions for
        every change in a vehicle''s design parameters. This is often a very tedious,
        manual, and time-consuming task for the analysts. Moreover, the trajectory
        design space is highly non-linear and multi-modal due to the interaction of
        various constraints. When these obstacles are coupled with the Program to
        Optimize Simulated Trajectories (POST), an industry standard program to optimize
        ascent trajectories that is difficult to use, expert trajectory analysts are
        required to effectively optimize a vehicle''s ascent trajectory. Over the
        course of this paper, the authors discuss a methodology developed at NASA
        Marshall''s Advanced Concepts Office to address these issues. The methodology
        is two-fold: first, capture the heuristics developed by human analysts over
        their many years of experience; and secondly, leverage the power of modern
        computing to evaluate multiple trajectories simultaneously and therefore enable
        the exploration of the trajectory''s design space early during the pre- conceptual
        and conceptual phases of design. This methodology is coupled with design of
        experiments in order to train surrogate models, which enables trajectory design
        space visualization and parametric optimal ascent trajectory information to
        be available when early design decisions are being made.", "venue": "", "year":

        "With the retirement of the Space Shuttle, NASA is seeking to reinvigorate
        the national space program and recapture the public s interest in human space
        exploration by developing missions to the Moon, near-earth asteroids, Lagrange
        points, Mars, and beyond. The would-be successor to the Space Shuttle, NASA
        s Constellation Program, planned to take humans back to the Moon by 2020,
        but due to budgetary constraints was cancelled in 2010 in search of a more
        \"affordable, sustainable, and realistic\" concept2. Following a number of
        studies, the much anticipated Space Launch System (SLS) was unveiled in September
        of 2011. The SLS core architecture consists of a cryogenic first stage with
        five Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs), and a cryogenic second stage using
        a new J-2X engine3. The baseline configuration employs two 5-segment solid
        rocket boosters to achieve a 70 metric ton payload capability, but a new,
        more capable booster system will be required to attain the goal of 130 metric
        tons to orbit. To this end, NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center recently released
        a NASA Research Announcement (NRA) entitled \"Space Launch System (SLS) Advanced
        Booster Engineering Demonstration and/or Risk Reduction.\" The increased emphasis
        on affordability is evident in the language used in the NRA, which is focused
        on risk reduction \"leading to an affordable Advanced Booster that meets the
        evolved capabilities of SLS\" and \"enabling competition\" to \"enhance SLS
        affordability. The purpose of the work presented in this paper is to perform
        an independent assessment of the elements that make up an affordable and realistic
        path forward for the SLS booster system, utilizing advanced design methods
        and technology evaluation techniques. The goal is to identify elements that
        will enable a more sustainable development program by exploring the trade
        space of heavy lift booster systems and focusing on affordability, operability,
        and reliability at the system and subsystem levels5. For this study, affordability
        is defined as lifecycle cost, which includes design, development, test, and
        engineering (DDTE by sharing some of the risk and investment, the overall
        development cost may be reduced. Consideration is not limited to solid and
        liquid rocket boosters. A set of functional performance characteristics, such
        as engine thrust, specific impulse (Isp), mixture ratio, and throttle range
        are identified and their impacts on the system are evaluated. This study also
        identifies how such characteristics affect overall life cycle cost, including
        DDT&E and fixed and variable P&O.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

        optimization is a complex process requiring many iterations of a high fidelity

        this process by requiring inner optimization loops necessary for trajectory
        simulation. Multi-stage vehicles add complexity to this analysis process as
        changes in vehicle properties in one stage propagate to the other stages and
        change the optimal trajectory. These effects can cause an increase in analysis
        time as more variables are added and convergence of the optimizer to system

        "title": "Hydrocarbon Rocket Technology Impact Forecasting", "abstract": "Ever
        since the Apollo program ended, the development of launch propulsion systems
        in the US has fallen drastically, with only two new booster engine developments,
        the SSME and the RS-68, occurring in the past few decades.1 In recent years,
        however, there has been an increased interest in pursuing more effective launch
        propulsion technologies in the U.S., exemplified by the NASA Office of the
        Chief Technologist s inclusion of Launch Propulsion Systems as the first technological
        area in the Space Technology Roadmaps2. One area of particular interest to
        both government agencies and commercial entities has been the development
        of hydrocarbon engines; NASA and the Air Force Research Lab3 have expressed
        interest in the use of hydrocarbon fuels for their respective SLS Booster
        and Reusable Booster System concepts, and two major commercially-developed
        launch vehicles SpaceX s Falcon 9 and Orbital Sciences Antares feature engines
        that use RP-1 kerosene fuel. Compared to engines powered by liquid hydrogen,
        hydrocarbon-fueled engines have a greater propellant density (usually resulting
        in a lighter overall engine), produce greater propulsive force, possess easier
        fuel handling and loading, and for reusable vehicle concepts can provide a
        shorter turnaround time between launches. These benefits suggest that a hydrocarbon-fueled
        launch vehicle would allow for a cheap and frequent means of access to space.1
        However, the time and money required for the development of a new engine still
        presents a major challenge. Long and costly design, development, testing and
        evaluation (DDT&E) programs underscore the importance of identifying critical
        technologies and prioritizing investment efforts. Trade studies must be performed
        on engine concepts examining the affordability, operability, and reliability
        of each concept, and quantifying the impacts of proposed technologies. These
        studies can be performed through use of the Technology Impact Forecasting
        (TIF) method. The Technology Impact Forecasting method is a normative forecasting
        technique that allows the designer to quantify the effects of adding new technologies
        on a given design. This method can be used to assess and identify the necessary
        technological improvements needed to close the gap that exists between the
        current design and one that satisfies all constraints imposed on the design.
        The TIF methodology allows for more design knowledge to be brought to the
        earlier phases of the design process, making use of tools such as Quality
        Function Deployments, Morphological Matrices, Response Surface Methodology,
        and Monte Carlo Simulations.2 This increased knowledge allows for more informed
        decisions to be made earlier in the design process, resulting in shortened
        design cycle time. This paper will investigate applying the TIF method, which
        has been widely used in aircraft applications, to the conceptual design of
        a hydrocarbon rocket engine. In order to reinstate a manned presence in space,
        the U.S. must develop an affordable and sustainable launch capability. Hydrocarbon-fueled
        rockets have drawn interest from numerous major government and commercial
        entities because they offer a low-cost heavy-lift option that would allow
        for frequent launches1. However, the development of effective new hydrocarbon
        rockets would likely require new technologies in order to overcome certain
        design constraints. The use of advanced design methods, such as the TIF method,
        enables the designer to identify key areas in need of improvement, allowing
        one to dial in a proposed technology and assess its impact on the system.
        Through analyses such as this one, a conceptual design for a hydrocarbon-fueled
        vehicle that meets all imposed requirements can be achieved.", "venue": "",

        "title": "Creation of a Rapid High-Fidelity Aerodynamics Module for a Multidisciplinary
        Design Environment", "abstract": "In the traditional aerospace vehicle design
        process, each successive design phase is accompanied by an increment in the
        modeling fidelity of the disciplinary analyses being performed. This trend
        follows a corresponding shrinking of the design space as more and more design
        decisions are locked in. The correlated increase in knowledge about the design
        and decrease in design freedom occurs partly because increases in modeling
        fidelity are usually accompanied by significant increases in the computational
        expense of performing the analyses. When running high fidelity analyses, it
        is not usually feasible to explore a large number of variations, and so design
        space exploration is reserved for conceptual design, and higher fidelity analyses
        are run only once a specific point design has been selected to carry forward.
        The designs produced by this traditional process have been recognized as being
        limited by the uncertainty that is present early on due to the use of lower
        fidelity analyses. For example, uncertainty in aerodynamics predictions produces
        uncertainty in trajectory optimization, which can impact overall vehicle sizing.
        This effect can become more significant when trajectories are being shaped
        by active constraints. For example, if an optimal trajectory is running up
        against a normal load factor constraint, inaccuracies in the aerodynamic coefficient
        predictions can cause a feasible trajectory to be considered infeasible, or
        vice versa. For this reason, a trade must always be performed between the
        desired fidelity and the resources available. Apart from this trade between
        fidelity and computational expense, it is very desirable to use higher fidelity
        analyses earlier in the design process. A large body of work has been performed
        to this end, led by efforts in the area of surrogate modeling. In surrogate
        modeling, an up-front investment is made by running a high fidelity code over
        a Design of Experiments (DOE); once completed, the DOE data is used to create
        a surrogate model, which captures the relationships between input variables
        and responses into regression equations. Depending on the dimensionality of
        the problem and the fidelity of the code for which a surrogate model is being
        created, the initial DOE can itself be computationally prohibitive to run.
        Cokriging, a modeling approach from the field of geostatistics, provides a
        desirable compromise between computational expense and fidelity. To do this,
        cokriging leverages a large body of data generated by a low fidelity analysis,
        combines it with a smaller set of data from a higher fidelity analysis, and
        creates a kriging surrogate model with prediction fidelity approaching that
        of the higher fidelity analysis. When integrated into a multidisciplinary
        environment, a disciplinary analysis module employing cokriging can raise
        the analysis fidelity without drastically impacting the expense of design
        iterations. This is demonstrated through the creation of an aerodynamics analysis
        module in NASA s OpenMDAO framework. Aerodynamic analyses including Missile
        DATCOM, APAS, and USM3D are leveraged to create high fidelity aerodynamics
        decks for parametric vehicle geometries, which are created in NASA s Vehicle
        Sketch Pad (VSP). Several trade studies are performed to examine the achieved
        level of model fidelity, and the overall impact to vehicle design is quantified.",

        and cost-effective manner has driven the development of new alternative methods
        (NAMs) that utilize in silico and in vitro approaches for toxicity prediction.
        There is a wealth of existing data from human studies that can aid in understanding
        the ability of NAMs to support chemical safety assessment. This study aims
        to streamline the integration of data from existing human cohorts by programmatically
        identifying related variables within each study. Study variables from the
        Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study were clustered based on their
        correlation within the study. The quality of the clusters was evaluated via
        a combination of manual review and natural language processing (NLP). We identified
        391 clusters including 3,285 variables. Manual review of the clusters containing
        more than one variable determined that human reviewers considered 95% of the
        clusters related to some degree. To evaluate potential bias in the human reviewers,
        clusters were also scored via NLP, which showed a high concordance with the
        human classification. Clusters were further consolidated into cluster groups
        using the Louvain community finding algorithm. Manual review of the cluster
        groups confirmed that clusters within a group were more related than clusters
        from different groups. Our data-driven approach can facilitate data harmonization
        and curation efforts by providing human annotators with groups of related
        variables reflecting the themes present in the data. Reviewing groups of related
        variables should increase efficiency of the human review, and the number of
        variables reviewed can be reduced by focusing curator attention on variable
        groups whose theme is relevant for the topic being studied.", "venue": "Frontiers

        invited to work on concrete products to advance the exploration of how evidence-based
        approaches can support the development and application of adverse outcome
        pathways (AOP) in chemical risk assessment. The workshop discussions were
        centered around three related themes: 1) assessing certainty in AOPs, 2) literature-based
        AOP development, and 3) integrating certainty in AOPs and non-animal evidence
        into decision frameworks. Several challenges, mostly related to methodology,
        were identified and largely determined the workshop recommendations. The workshop
        recommendations included the comparison and potential alignment of processes

        of vocabulary of evidence-based methods to AOP and vice versa, the development
        and improvement of evidence mapping and text mining methods and tools, as
        well as a call for a fundamental change in chemical risk and uncertainty assessment
        methodology if to be conducted based on AOPs and new approach methodologies
        (NAM). The usefulness of evidence-based approaches for mechanism-based chemical
        risk assessments was stressed, particularly the potential contribution of
        the rigor and transparency inherent to such approaches in building stakeholders\u2019
        trust for implementation of NAM evidence and AOPs into chemical risk assessment.",

        Chemical Structure and Bioactivity Measurements", "abstract": "Regulatory
        agencies around the world have committed to reducing or eliminating animal
        testing for establishing chemical safety. Adverse outcome pathways can facilitate
        replacement by providing a mechanistic framework for identifying the appropriate
        non-animal methods and connecting them to apical adverse outcomes. This study
        separated 11,992 chemicals with curated rat oral acute toxicity information
        into clusters of structurally similar compounds. Each cluster was then assigned
        one or more ToxCast/Tox21 assays by looking for the minimum number of assays
        required to record at least one positive hit call below cytotoxicity for all
        acutely toxic chemicals in the cluster. When structural information is used
        to select assays for testing, none of the chemicals required more than four
        assays and 98% required two assays or less. Both the structure-based clusters
        and activity from the associated assays were significantly associated with
        the GHS toxicity classification of the chemicals, which suggests that a combination
        of bioactivity and structural information could be as reproducible as traditional
        in vivo studies. Predictivity is improved when the in vitro assay directly
        corresponds to the mechanism of toxicity, but many indirect assays showed
        promise as well. Given the lower cost of in vitro testing, a small assay battery
        including both general cytotoxicity assays and two or more orthogonal assays
        targeting the toxicological mechanism could be used to improve performance
        further. This approach illustrates the promise of combining existing in silico
        approaches, such as the Collaborative Acute Toxicity Modeling Suite (CATMoS),
        with structure-based bioactivity information as part of an efficient tiered
        testing strategy that can reduce or eliminate animal testing for acute oral
        toxicity.", "venue": "Frontiers in Toxicology", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

        Collaboration and hosted by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
        and Evaluation Working Group on June 12, 2019. The purpose of the workshop
        was to bring together international regulatory bodies, risk assessors, academic
        scientists, and industry to explore how systematic review methods and the
        adverse outcome pathway framework could be combined to develop and use mechanistic
        test methods for predicting the toxicity of chemical substances in an evidence-based
        manner. The meeting covered the history of biological frameworks, the way
        adverse outcome pathways are currently developed, the basic principles of
        systematic methodology, including systematic reviews and evidence maps, and
        assessment of certainty in models, and adverse outcome pathways in particular.
        Specific topics were discussed via case studies in small break-out groups.
        The group concluded that adverse outcome pathways provide an important framework
        to support mechanism-based assessment in environmental health. The process
        of their development has a few challenges that could be addressed with systematic
        methods and automation tools. Addressing these challenges will increase the
        transparency of the evidence behind adverse outcome pathways and the consistency
        with which they are defined; this in turn will increase their value for supporting
        public health decisions. It was suggested to explore the details of applying
        systematic methods to adverse outcome pathway development in a series of case

        for acute systemic lethality.", "abstract": "Efforts are underway to develop
        and implement nonanimal approaches which can characterize acute systemic lethality.
        A workshop was held in October 2019 to discuss developments in the prediction
        of acute oral lethality for chemicals and mixtures, as well as progress and
        needs in the understanding and modeling of mechanisms of acute lethality.
        During the workshop, each speaker led the group through a series of charge
        questions to determine clear next steps to progress the aims of the workshop.
        Participants concluded that a variety of approaches will be needed and should
        be applied in a tiered fashion. Non-testing approaches, including waiving
        tests, computational models for single chemicals, and calculating the acute
        lethality of mixtures based on the LD50 values of mixture components, could
        be used for some assessments now, especially in the very toxic or non-toxic
        classification ranges. Agencies can develop policies indicating contexts under
        which mathematical approaches for mixtures assessment are acceptable; to expand
        applicability, poorly predicted mixtures should be examined to understand
        discrepancies and adapt the approach. Transparency and an understanding of
        the variability of in vivo approaches are crucial to facilitate regulatory
        application of new approaches. In a replacement strategy, mechanistically
        based in vitro or in silico models will be needed to support non-testing approaches
        especially for highly acutely toxic chemicals. The workshop discussed approaches
        that can be used in the immediate or near term for some applications and identified
        remaining actions needed to implement approaches to fully replace the use
        of animals for acute systemic toxicity testing.", "venue": "ALTEX", "year":

        structured frameworks for the systematic organization of research data and
        knowledge. The AOP framework follows a set of key principles that allow for
        broad application across diverse disciplines related to human health, including
        toxicology, pharmacology, virology and medical research. The COVID-19 pandemic
        engages a great number of scientists world-wide and data is increasing with
        exponential speed. Diligent data management strategies are employed but approaches
        for systematically organizing the data-derived information and knowledge are
        lacking. We believe AOPs can play an important role in improving interpretation
        and efficient application of scientific understanding of COVID-19. Here, we
        outline a newly initiated effort, the CIAO project (https://www.ciao-covid.net/),
        to streamline collaboration between scientists across the world toward development
        of AOPs for COVID-19, and describe the overarching aims of the effort, as
        well as the expected outcomes and research support that they will provide.",

        events in adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) that link molecular chemistry to
        target biology. As they are based in chemistry, these interactions are excellent
        targets for computational chemistry approaches to in silico modelling. In
        this work, we aim to link ligand chemical structure to MIEs for androgen receptor
        (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding using ToxCast data. This has
        been done using an automated computational algorithm to perform maximal common
        substructure searches on chemical binders for each target from the ToxCast
        dataset. The models developed show a high level of accuracy, correctly assigning
        87.20% of AR binders and 96.81% of GR binders in a 25% test set using holdout
        cross-validation. The 2D structural alerts developed can be used as in silico
        models to predict these MIEs, and as guidance for in vitro ToxCast assays
        to confirm hits. These models can target such experimental work, reducing
        the number of assays to be performed to gain required toxicological insight.
        Development of these models has also allowed some structural alerts to be
        identified as predictors for agonist or antagonist behavior at the receptor
        target. This work represents a first step in using computational methods to
        guide and target experimental approaches.", "venue": "Environmental Science

        "abstract": "Background: Although the implementation of systematic review
        and evidence mapping methods stands to improve the transparency and accuracy
        of chemical assessments, they also accentuate the challenges that assessors
        face in ensuring they have located and included all the evidence that is relevant
        to evaluating the potential health effects an exposure might be causing. This
        challenge of information retrieval can be characterized in terms of \u201csemantic\u201d
        and \u201cconceptual\u201d factors that render chemical assessments vulnerable
        to the streetlight effect. Objectives: This commentary presents how controlled
        vocabularies, thesauruses, and ontologies contribute to overcoming the streetlight
        effect in information retrieval, making up the key components of Knowledge
        Organization Systems (KOSs) that enable more systematic access to assessment-relevant
        information than is currently achievable. The concept of Adverse Outcome Pathways
        is used to illustrate what a general KOS for use in chemical assessment could
        look like. Discussion: Ontologies are an underexploited element of effective
        knowledge organization in the environmental health sciences. Agreeing on and
        implementing ontologies in chemical assessment is a complex but tractable
        process with four fundamental steps. Successful implementation of ontologies
        would not only make currently fragmented information about health risks from
        chemical exposures vastly more accessible, it could ultimately enable computational
        methods for chemical assessment that can take advantage of the full richness
        of data described in natural language in primary studies. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6994",

        data are generated on large scales by toxicogenomic studies and high-throughput

        Both big and small data have value for elucidating toxicological mechanisms
        and pathways that are perturbed by chemical stressors. In addition, years
        of investigations comprise a wealth of knowledge as reported in the literature
        that is also used to interpret new data, though knowledge is not often captured

        in measurement technologies and modeling capabilities continue to result in
        an abundance of exposure information, adding to that currently in existence.
        However, fragmentation within the exposure science community acts as an obstacle
        for realizing the vision set forth in the National Research Council''s report
        on Exposure Science in the 21st century to consider exposures from source
        to dose, on multiple levels of integration, and to multiple stressors. The
        concept of an Aggregate Exposure Pathway (AEP) was proposed as a framework
        for organizing and integrating diverse exposure information that exists across
        numerous repositories and among multiple scientific fields. A workshop held
        in May 2016 followed introduction of the AEP concept, allowing members of
        the exposure science community to provide extensive evaluation and feedback
        regarding the framework''s structure, key components, and applications. The
        current work briefly introduces topics discussed at the workshop and attempts
        to address key challenges involved in refining this framework. The resulting
        evolution in the AEP framework''s features allows for facilitating acquisition,
        integration, organization, and transparent application and communication of
        exposure knowledge in a manner that is independent of its ultimate use, thereby

        Toxicity Data: A Foundation for Prioritizing Adverse Outcome Pathway Development",
        "abstract": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency''s ToxCast program has
        screened thousands of chemicals for biological activity, primarily using high-throughput
        in vitro bioassays. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) offer a means to link
        pathway-specific biological activities with potential apical effects relevant
        to risk assessors. Thus, efforts are underway to develop AOPs relevant to
        pathway-specific perturbations detected in ToxCast assays. Previous work identified
        a \"cytotoxic burst\" (CTB) phenomenon wherein large numbers of the ToxCast
        assays begin to respond at or near test chemical concentrations that elicit
        cytotoxicity, and a statistical approach to defining the bounds of the CTB
        was developed. To focus AOP development on the molecular targets corresponding
        to ToxCast assays indicating pathway-specific effects, we conducted a meta-analysis
        to identify which assays most frequently respond at concentrations below the
        CTB. A preliminary list of potentially important, target-specific assays was
        determined by ranking assays by the fraction of chemical hits below the CTB
        compared with the number of chemicals tested. Additional priority assays were
        identified using a diagnostic-odds-ratio approach which gives greater ranking
        to assays with high specificity but low responsivity. Combined, the two prioritization
        methods identified several novel targets (e.g., peripheral benzodiazepine
        and progesterone receptors) to prioritize for AOP development, and affirmed
        the importance of a number of existing AOPs aligned with ToxCast targets (e.g.,
        thyroperoxidase, estrogen receptor, aromatase). The prioritization approaches
        did not appear to be influenced by inter-assay differences in chemical bioavailability.
        Furthermore, the outcomes were robust based on a variety of different parameters
        used to define the CTB.", "venue": "Toxicological Sciences", "year": 2018,

        and Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) Frameworks to Facilitate the Integration

        "abstract": "Cumulative risk assessment (CRA) methods promote the use of a
        conceptual site model (CSM) to apportion exposures and integrate risk from
        multiple stressors. While CSMs may encompass multiple species, evaluating
        end points across taxa can be challenging due to data availability and physiological
        differences among organisms. Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) describe biological
        mechanisms leading to adverse outcomes (AOs) by assembling causal pathways
        with measurable intermediate steps termed key events (KEs), thereby providing
        a framework for integrating data across species. In this work, we used a case
        study focused on the perchlorate anion (ClO4-) to highlight the value of the
        AOP framework for cross-species data integration. Computational models and
        dose-response data were used to evaluate the effects of ClO4- in 12 species
        and revealed a dose-response concordance across KEs and taxa. The aggregate
        exposure pathway (AEP) tracks stressors from sources to the exposures and
        serves as a complement to the AOP. We discuss how the combined AEP-AOP construct
        helps to maximize the use of existing data and advances CRA by (1) organizing
        toxicity and exposure data, (2) providing a mechanistic framework of KEs for
        integrating data across human health and ecological end points, (3) facilitating
        cross-species dose-response evaluation, and (4) highlighting data gaps and

        "title": "CHAPTER 4:Linking Environmental Exposure to Toxicity", "abstract":
        "As the number of chemicals and environmental toxicants in commerce continue
        to increase, so does the need to understand the links between exposure to
        these stressors and any potential toxic reactions. Assessing the impact of
        these stressors on public health as well as our environment requires an understanding
        of the underlying mechanistic processes connecting their introduction into
        the environment to the associated adverse outcomes.Traditional in vivo methods
        of toxicity testing have become too costly and inefficient. In recent times,
        in vitro high-throughput toxicity screening methods have been introduced to
        reduce the burden of in vivo testing and keep pace with the ever increasing
        number of required tests. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept has been
        adopted by many in the toxicology community as a framework for linking the
        biological events that occur from the point of contact with these stressors
        and the resulting adverse outcome. This provides a mechanistic framework for
        understanding the potential impacts of perturbations that are measured via
        in vitro testing strategies. The aggregate exposure pathway (AEP) has been
        proposed as a companion framework to the AOP. The goal of the AEP is to describe
        the path the introduction of the stressor into the environment at its source
        to a target site within an individual that is comparable with the concentrations
        in the in vitro toxicity tests. Together, these frameworks provide a comprehensive
        view of the source to adverse outcome continuum.Standardizing our representation
        of the mechanistic information in this way allows for increased interoperability
        for computational models describing different parts of the system. It also
        aids in translating new research in exposure science and toxicology for risk
        assessors and decision makers when assessing the impact of specific stressors
        on endpoints of regulatory significance.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount":

        When Prioritizing Chemicals Screened in High-Throughput Assays.", "abstract":
        "The toxicity-testing paradigm has evolved to include high-throughput (HT)
        methods for addressing the increasing need to screen hundreds to thousands
        of chemicals rapidly. Approaches that involve in vitro screening assays, in
        silico predictions of exposure concentrations, and pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics
        provide the foundation for HT risk prioritization. Underlying uncertainties
        in predicted exposure concentrations or PK behaviors can significantly influence
        the prioritization of chemicals, though the impact of such influences is unclear.
        In the current study, a framework was developed to incorporate absorbed doses,
        PK properties, and in vitro dose-response data into a PK/pharmacodynamic (PD)
        model to allow for placement of chemicals into discrete priority bins. Literature-reported
        or predicted values for clearance rates and absorbed doses were used in the
        PK/PD model to evaluate the impact of their uncertainties on chemical prioritization.
        Scenarios using predicted absorbed doses resulted in a larger number of bin
        misassignments than those scenarios using predicted clearance rates, when
        comparing to bin placement using literature-reported values. Sensitivity of
        parameters on the model output of toxicological activity was examined across
        possible ranges for those parameters to provide insight into how uncertainty
        in their predicted values might impact uncertainty in activity.", "venue":

        to Improve Decision Making", "abstract": "The number of chemicals for which
        environmental regulatory decisions are required far exceeds the current capacity
        for toxicity testing. High-throughput screening commonly used for drug discovery
        has the potential to increase this capacity. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP)
        concept has emerged as a framework for connecting high-throughput toxicity
        testing (HTT) and other results to potential impacts on human and wildlife
        populations. As a result of international efforts, the AOP development process
        is now well-defined and efforts are underway to broaden the participation
        through outreach and training. One key principle is that AOPs represent the
        chemical-agnostic portions of pathways to increase the generalizability of
        their application from early key events to overt toxicity. The closely related
        mode of action framework extends the AOP as needed when evaluating the potential
        risk of a specific chemical. This in turn enables integrated approaches to
        testing and assessment (IATA), which incorporate results of assays at various
        levels of biologic organization such as in silico; HTT; chemical-specific
        aspects including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME);
        and an AOP describing the biologic basis of toxicity. Thus, it is envisaged
        that provision of limited information regarding both the AOP for critical
        effects and the ADME for any chemical associated with any adverse outcome
        would allow for the development of IATA and permit more detailed AOP and ADME

        strategies make it possible to design testing batteries for large numbers
        of environmental chemicals. Full utilization of the results requires knowledge
        of the underlying biological networks and the adverse outcome pathways (AOPs)
        that describe the route from early molecular perturbations to an adverse outcome.
        Curation of a formal AOP is a time-intensive process and a rate-limiting step
        to designing these test batteries. Here, we describe a method for integrating
        publicly available data in order to generate computationally predicted AOP
        (cpAOP) scaffolds, which can be leveraged by domain experts to shorten the
        time for formal AOP development. A network-based workflow was used to facilitate
        the integration of multiple data types to generate cpAOPs. Edges between graph
        entities were identified through direct experimental or literature information,
        or computationally inferred using frequent itemset mining. Data from the TG-GATEs
        and ToxCast programs were used to channel large-scale toxicogenomics information
        into a cpAOP network (cpAOPnet) of over 20 000 relationships describing connections
        between chemical treatments, phenotypes, and perturbed pathways as measured
        by differential gene expression and high-throughput screening targets. The
        resulting fatty liver cpAOPnet is available as a resource to the community.
        Subnetworks of cpAOPs for a reference chemical (carbon tetrachloride, CCl4)
        and outcome (fatty liver) were compared with published mechanistic descriptions.
        In both cases, the computational approaches approximated the manually curated
        AOPs. The cpAOPnet can be used for accelerating expert-curated AOP development
        and to identify pathway targets that lack genomic markers or high-throughput
        screening tests. It can also facilitate identification of key events for designing
        test batteries and for classification and grouping of chemicals for follow

        methods, biomonitoring, computation, and a newly articulated vision for a
        greater impact in public health, the field of exposure science is undergoing
        a rapid transition from a field of observation to a field of prediction. Deployment
        of an organizational and predictive framework for exposure science analogous
        to the \"systems approaches\" used in the biological sciences is a necessary
        step in this evolution. Here we propose the aggregate exposure pathway (AEP)
        concept as the natural and complementary companion in the exposure sciences
        to the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) concept in the toxicological sciences.
        Aggregate exposure pathways offer an intuitive framework to organize exposure
        data within individual units of prediction common to the field, setting the
        stage for exposure forecasting. Looking farther ahead, we envision direct
        linkages between aggregate exposure pathways and adverse outcome pathways,
        completing the source to outcome continuum for more meaningful integration
        of exposure assessment and hazard identification. Together, the two frameworks

        "In her letter to the editor1 regarding our recent Feature Article \u201cCompleting
        the Link between Exposure Science and Toxicology for Improved Environmental
        Health Decision Making: The Aggregate Exposure Pathway Framework\u201d 2,
        Dr. von Goetz expressed several concerns about terminology, and the perception
        that we propose the replacement of successful approaches and models for exposure
        assessment with a concept. We are glad to have the opportunity to address
        these issues here. If the goal of the AEP framework was to replace existing
        exposure models or databases for organizing exposure data with a concept,
        we would share Dr. von Goetz concerns. Instead, the outcome we promote is
        broader use of an organizational framework for exposure science. The framework
        would support improved generation, organization, and interpretation of data
        as well as modeling and prediction, not replacement of models. The field of
        toxicology has seen the benefits of wide use of one or more organizational
        frameworks (e.g., mode and mechanism of action, adverse outcome pathway).
        These frameworks influence how experiments are designed, data are collected,
        curated, stored and interpreted and ultimately how data are used in risk assessment.
        Exposure science is poised to similarly benefit from broader use of a parallel
        organizational framework, whichmore\u00a0\u00bb Dr. von Goetz correctly points
        out, is currently used in the exposure modeling community. In our view, the
        concepts used so effectively in the exposure modeling community, expanded
        upon in the AEP framework, could see wider adoption by the field as a whole.
        The value of such a framework was recognized by the National Academy of Sciences.3
        Replacement of models, databases, or any application with the AEP framework
        was not proposed in our article. The positive role broader more consistent
        use of such a framework might have in enabling and advancing \u201cgeneral
        activities such as data acquisition, organization\u2026,\u201d and exposure
        modeling was discussed in some detail. Like Dr. von Goetz, we recognized the
        challenges associated with acceptance of the terminology, definitions, and
        structure proposed in the paper. To address these challenges, an expert workshop
        was held in May, 2016 to consider and revise the \u201cbasic elements\u201d
        outlined in the paper. The attendees produced revisions to the terminology
        (e.g., key events) that align with terminology currently in use in the field.
        We were also careful in our paper to acknowledge a point raised by Dr. von
        Goetz, that the term AEP implies aggregation, providing these clarifications:
        \u201cThe simplest form of an AEP represents a single source and a single
        pathway and may more commonly be referred to as an exposure pathway,\u201d;
        and \u201cAn aggregate exposure pathway may represent multiple sources and
        transfer through single pathways to the TSE, single sources and transfer through
        multiple pathways to the target site exposure (TSE), or any combination of
        these.\u201d These clarifications address the concern that the AEP term is
        not accurate or logical, and further expands upon the word \u201caggregate\u201d
        in a broader context. Our use of AEP is consistent with the definition for
        \u201caggregate exposure\u201d, which refers to the combined exposures to
        a single chemical across multiple routes and pathways.3 The AEP framework
        embraces existing methods for collection, prediction, organization, and interpretation
        of human and ecological exposure data cited by Dr. von Goetz. We remain hopeful
        that wider recognition and use of an organizing concept for exposure information
        across the exposure science, toxicology and epidemiology communities advances
        the development of the kind of infrastructure and models Dr. von Goetz discusses.
        This outcome would be a step forward, rather than a step backward.\u00ab\u00a0less",

        "Background: The Next Generation (NexGen) of Risk Assessment effort is a multi-year
        collaboration among several organizations evaluating new, potentially more
        efficient molecular, computational, and systems biology approaches to risk
        assessment. This article summarizes our findings, suggests applications to
        risk assessment, and identifies strategic research directions. Objective:
        Our specific objectives were to test whether advanced biological data and
        methods could better inform our understanding of public health risks posed
        by environmental exposures. Methods: New data and methods were applied and
        evaluated for use in hazard identification and dose\u2013response assessment.
        Biomarkers of exposure and effect, and risk characterization were also examined.
        Consideration was given to various decision contexts with increasing regulatory
        and public health impacts. Data types included transcriptomics, genomics,
        and proteomics. Methods included molecular epidemiology and clinical studies,
        bioinformatic knowledge mining, pathway and network analyses, short-duration
        in vivo and in vitro bioassays, and quantitative structure activity relationship
        modeling. Discussion: NexGen has advanced our ability to apply new science
        by more rapidly identifying chemicals and exposures of potential concern,
        helping characterize mechanisms of action that influence conclusions about
        causality, exposure\u2013response relationships, susceptibility and cumulative
        risk, and by elucidating new biomarkers of exposure and effects. Additionally,
        NexGen has fostered extensive discussion among risk scientists and managers
        and improved confidence in interpreting and applying new data streams. Conclusions:
        While considerable uncertainties remain, thoughtful application of new knowledge
        to risk assessment appears reasonable for augmenting major scope assessments,
        forming the basis for or augmenting limited scope assessments, and for prioritization
        and screening of very data limited chemicals. Citation: Cote I, Andersen ME,

        Stressors and Adverse Human Health Impacts", "abstract": "Background There
        are > 80,000 chemicals in commerce with few data available describing their
        impacts on human health. Biomonitoring surveys, such as the NHANES (National
        Health and Nutrition Examination Survey), offer one route to identifying possible
        relationships between environmental chemicals and health impacts, but sparse
        data and the complexity of traditional models make it difficult to leverage
        effectively. Objective We describe a workflow to efficiently and comprehensively
        evaluate and prioritize chemical\u2013health impact relationships from the
        NHANES biomonitoring survey studies. Methods Using a frequent itemset mining
        (FIM) approach, we identified relationships between chemicals and health biomarkers
        and diseases. Results The FIM method identified 7,848 relationships between
        219 chemicals and 93 health outcomes/biomarkers. Two case studies used to
        evaluate the FIM rankings demonstrate that the FIM approach is able to identify
        published relationships. Because the relationships are derived from the vast
        majority of the chemicals monitored by NHANES, the resulting list of associations
        is appropriate for evaluating results from targeted data mining or identifying
        novel candidate relationships for more detailed investigation. Conclusions
        Because of the computational efficiency of the FIM method, all chemicals and
        health effects can be considered in a single analysis. The resulting list
        provides a comprehensive summary of the chemical/health co-occurrences from
        NHANES that are higher than expected by chance. This information enables ranking
        and prioritization on chemicals or health effects of interest for evaluation
        of published results and design of future studies. Citation Bell SM, Edwards

        "title": "Systems Biology and Biomarkers of Early Effects for Occupational
        Exposure Limit Setting", "abstract": "In a recent National Research Council
        document, new strategies for risk assessment were described to enable more
        accurate and quicker assessments.(1) This report suggested that evaluating
        individual responses through increased use of bio-monitoring could improve
        dose-response estimations. Identi-fication of specific biomarkers may be useful
        for diagnostics or risk prediction as they have the potential to improve exposure
        assessments. This paper discusses systems biology, biomarkers of effect, and
        computational toxicology approaches and their relevance to the occupational
        exposure limit setting process. The systems biology approach evaluates the
        integration of biological processes and how disruption of these processes
        by chemicals or other hazards affects disease outcomes. This type of approach
        could provide information used in delineating the mode of action of the response
        or toxicity, and may be useful to define the low adverse and no adverse effect
        levels. Biomarkers of effect are changes measured in biological systems and
        are considered to be preclinical in nature. Advances in computational methods
        and experimental -omics methods that allow the simultaneous measurement of
        families of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins in a single analysis
        have made these systems approaches feasible for broad application. The utility
        of the information for risk assessments from -omics approaches has shown promise
        and can provide information on mode of action and dose-response relationships.
        As these techniques evolve, estimation of internal dose and response biomarkers
        will be a critical test of these new technologies for application in risk
        assessment strategies. While proof of concept studies have been conducted
        that provide evidence of their value, challenges with standardization and
        harmonization still need to be overcome before these methods are used routinely.",

        "title": "Uses of NHANES Biomarker Data for Chemical Risk Assessment: Trends,
        Challenges, and Opportunities", "abstract": "Background Each year, the U.S.
        NHANES measures hundreds of chemical biomarkers in samples from thousands
        of study participants. These biomarker measurements are used to establish
        population reference ranges, track exposure trends, identify population subsets
        with elevated exposures, and prioritize research needs. There is now interest
        in further utilizing the NHANES data to inform chemical risk assessments.
        Objectives This article highlights a) the extent to which U.S. NHANES chemical
        biomarker data have been evaluated, b) groups of chemicals that have been
        studied, c) data analysis approaches and challenges, and d) opportunities
        for using these data to inform risk assessments. Methods A literature search
        (1999\u20132013) was performed to identify publications in which U.S. NHANES
        data were reported. Manual curation identified only the subset of publications
        that clearly utilized chemical biomarker data. This subset was evaluated for
        chemical groupings, data analysis approaches, and overall trends. Results
        A small percentage of the sampled NHANES-related publications reported on
        chemical biomarkers (8% yearly average). Of 11 chemical groups, metals/metalloids
        were most frequently evaluated (49%), followed by pesticides (9%) and environmental
        phenols (7%). Studies of multiple chemical groups were also common (8%). Publications
        linking chemical biomarkers to health metrics have increased dramatically
        in recent years. New studies are addressing challenges related to NHANES data
        interpretation in health risk contexts. Conclusions This article demonstrates
        growing use of NHANES chemical biomarker data in studies that can impact risk
        assessments. Best practices for analysis and interpretation must be defined
        and adopted to allow the full potential of NHANES to be realized. Citation

        on High-Throughput in Vitro Chemical Screening Based on Adverse Outcome Pathways",
        "abstract": "Background Adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) link adverse effects
        in individuals or populations to a molecular initiating event (MIE) that can
        be quantified using in vitro methods. Practical application of AOPs in chemical-specific
        risk assessment requires incorporation of knowledge on exposure, along with
        absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties of chemicals.
        Objectives We developed a conceptual workflow to examine exposure and ADME
        properties in relation to an MIE. The utility of this workflow was evaluated
        using a previously established AOP, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibition.
        Methods Thirty chemicals found to inhibit human AChE in the ToxCast\u2122
        assay were examined with respect to their exposure, absorption potential,
        and ability to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Structures of active
        chemicals were compared against structures of 1,029 inactive chemicals to
        detect possible parent compounds that might have active metabolites. Results
        Application of the workflow screened 10 \u201clow-priority\u201d chemicals
        of 30 active chemicals. Fifty-two of the 1,029 inactive chemicals exhibited
        a similarity threshold of \u2265 75% with their nearest active neighbors.
        Of these 52 compounds, 30 were excluded due to poor absorption or distribution.
        The remaining 22 compounds may inhibit AChE in vivo either directly or as
        a result of metabolic activation. Conclusions The incorporation of exposure
        and ADME properties into the conceptual workflow eliminated 10 \u201clow-priority\u201d
        chemicals that may otherwise have undergone additional, resource-consuming
        analyses. Our workflow also increased confidence in interpretation of in vitro
        results by identifying possible \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d Citation Phillips

        "Health effects are unknown for the vast majority of the >83,000 chemicals
        in commerce, creating challenges in balancing industrial needs against the
        complex landscape of health susceptibilities and exposures. The National Health
        and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), a large-scale survey aimed at
        determining the prevalence and risk factors of major diseases, is increasingly
        used to postulate relationships between chemicals and adverse health effects
        in the U.S. population. The interpretation of these studies is complicated,
        however, by the ad hoc data mining approaches typically employed. Here we
        describe the use of frequent itemset mining for identifying exposure \u21d2
        health associations in data from the NHANES 2005-2006 cycle. From 9,440 dichotomized
        samples, 983 two-itemset rules were generated describing associations between
        markers of health and environmental exposure (lift >1, response threshold
        >97.5th quantile). A case study using parathyroid hormone levels to develop
        exposure-health effect hypotheses is presented. This case study demonstrates
        how association rules can be used in data mining to facilitate hypothesis
        development and improve traditional regression models by identification of

        "Background: Over the past 20 years, knowledge of the genome and its function
        has increased dramatically, but risk assessment methodologies using such knowledge
        have not advanced accordingly. Objective: This commentary describes a collaborative
        effort among several federal and state agencies to advance the next generation
        of risk assessment. The objective of the NexGen program is to begin to incorporate
        recent progress in molecular and systems biology into risk assessment practice.
        The ultimate success of this program will be based on the incorporation of
        new practices that facilitate faster, cheaper, and/or more accurate assessments
        of public health risks. Methods: We are developing prototype risk assessments
        that compare the results of traditional, data-rich risk assessments with insights
        gained from new types of molecular and systems biology data. In this manner,
        new approaches can be validated, traditional approaches improved, and the
        value of different types of new scientific information better understood.
        Discussion and Conclusions: We anticipate that these new approaches will have
        a variety of applications, such as assessment of new and existing chemicals
        in commerce and the design of chemical products and processes that reduce
        or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Additionally,
        results of the effort are likely to spur further research and test methods
        development. Full implementation of new approaches is likely to take 10\u201320
        years.", "venue": "Environmental Health Perspectives", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Reverse engineering adverse outcome pathways", "abstract": "The
        toxicological effects of many stressors are mediated through unknown, or incompletely
        characterized, mechanisms of action. The application of reverse engineering
        complex interaction networks from high dimensional omics data (gene, protein,
        metabolic, signaling) can be used to overcome these limitations. This approach
        was used to characterize adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) for chemicals that
        disrupt the hypothalamus\u2010pituitary\u2010gonadal endocrine axis in fathead
        minnows (FHM, Pimephales promelas). Gene expression changes in FHM ovaries
        in response to seven different chemicals, over different times, doses, and
        in vivo versus in vitro conditions, were captured in a large data set of 868
        arrays. Potential AOPs of the antiandrogen flutamide were examined using two
        mutual information\u2010based methods to infer gene regulatory networks and
        potential AOPs. Representative networks from these studies were used to predict
        network paths from stressor to adverse outcome as candidate AOPs. The relationship
        of individual chemicals to an adverse outcome can be determined by following
        perturbations through the network in response to chemical treatment, thus
        leading to the nodes associated with the adverse outcome. Identification of
        candidate pathways allows for formation of testable hypotheses about key biological
        processes, biomarkers, or alternative endpoints that can be used to monitor
        an AOP. Finally, the unique challenges facing the application of this approach
        in ecotoxicology were identified and a road map for the utilization of these
        tools presented. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2011;30:22\u201338. \u00a9 2010 SETAC",

        that disrupt the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal endocrine axis that governs
        reproduction in fathead minnows. The construction of global gene regulatory

        rats exposed to ovalbumin and concentrated air particulates.", "abstract":
        "The interaction between air particulates and genetic susceptibility has been
        implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma. The overall objective of this study
        was to determine the effects of inhalation exposure to environmentally relevant
        concentrated air particulates (CAPs) on the lungs of ovalbumin (ova) sensitized
        and challenged Brown Norway rats. Changes in gene expression were compared
        with lung tissue histopathology, morphometry, and biochemical and cellular
        parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Ova challenge was responsible
        for the preponderance of gene expression changes, related largely to inflammation.
        CAPs exposure alone resulted in no significant gene expression changes, but
        CAPs and ova-exposed rodents exhibited an enhanced effect relative to ova
        alone with differentially expressed genes primarily related to inflammation
        and airway remodeling. Gene expression data was consistent with the biochemical
        and cellular analyses of the BALF, the pulmonary pathology, and morphometric
        changes when comparing the CAPs-ova group to the air-saline or CAPs-saline
        group. However, the gene expression data were more sensitive than the BALF
        cell type and number for assessing the effects of CAPs and ova versus the
        ova challenge alone. In addition, the gene expression results provided some
        additional insight into the TGF-beta-mediated molecular processes underlying
        these changes. The broad-based histopathology and functional genomic analyses
        demonstrate that exposure to CAPs exacerbates rodents with allergic inflammation
        induced by an allergen and suggests that asthmatics may be at increased risk
        for air pollution effects.", "venue": "Toxicological Sciences", "year": 2009,

        project explored habilitation service provision for children and young people
        with vision impairment across the UK. Using detailed case studies of how current
        delivery of habilitation training is experienced by children and young people,
        their families and the professionals involved, we explored notions of quality
        in habilitation services; whether and how services are achieving the learning
        outcomes set out in the Quality Standards in the Delivery of Habilitation
        Training; the problems that service users face in accessing habilitation services;
        and the issues facing professionals involved in the delivery of habilitation.
        Accessibility and quality of habilitation services across the UK is highly
        variable. The data illustrate the incredibly high value and importance of
        habilitation training to children, young people and their families. However,
        whilst there are many examples of excellent services, there remain considerable
        gaps in service delivery, with some areas failing to provide adequate services.
        Particular weaknesses in services surround provisions for young people upon
        leaving school, especially if they are leaving education. Supports available
        to parents are also especially lacking. The concept of habilitation is problematic;
        the lack of clarity of exactly what it is and who is responsible for delivering
        its various components it is at the heart of the problems of responsibilities
        for funding and delivery. Tackling these problems requires clarification of
        roles and responsibilities at conceptual and practical levels. The professionals
        involved in the delivery of habilitation services are under-valued and marginalised.
        Many face repeated departmental restructuring, changing job roles and employment
        insecurity, yet remain dedicated and motivated despite these frustrations.",

        system exploration", "abstract": "Semiautonomous rover scaling is examined
        for exploration throughout the solar system. Communications to a relay orbiter
        is a major constraint, due to power requirements and decreasing antenna gain
        at small sizes. Also, analysis time scales adversely for power hungry Raman
        or surface abrasion, and also for low photon count gamma ray spectroscopy.
        1 cm scale rovers with a MER like capability should be possible, and could
        operate on solar power to 40 AU. At 2 cm, rovers powered by current RTGs are
        feasible, and are useful in the outer solar system. Such rovers will return
        images, autonomously navigate from interest point to interest point, and autonomously
        deploy instruments. Analyses include elemental APX and gamma ray spectroscopy
        for elemental and Raman and IR spectroscopy for molecular and or mineralogical
        compositions. They can be built with current technology, the component size
        is similar to watch movements. Low temperatures are not an obstacle. Very
        high temperatures, e.g. 390 to 480 C for surface Venus, will require more
        work on high temperature electronics, but current work suggests that dense
        ICs for Venusian conditions should be feasible in the near future. Mm size
        rovers, designed primarily for imaging, are feasible at inner solar system
        solar flux levels. If deployed in large numbers, manufacturing developments
        would be needed to allow mechanised assembly of multiple MEMS systems. Miniature,
        degassing to space, RTGs could provide power in cold vacuum environments,

        "title": "Science Payoff from Noble Gas and Associated Halogen Analysis: Towards
        a Sample Wish List", "abstract": "Introduction: Noble gases have long played
        a central role in the development of our understanding of the evolution of
        the Earth and interactions among mantle, crust and atmosphere. The key to
        these developments has been the characterization of the isotopic and elemental
        compositions of the associated reservoirs. Recent work has concluded that
        the Earth originated with a noble gas component that was isotopically solar.
        It is thought that the present-day reservoirs evolved from this composition
        through outgassing, fractionation associated with loss processes and the admixture
        of decay products of various unstable isotopes[1]. What we know of the martian
        system is mostly based on analyses of martian meteorites. The story is somewhat
        similar. There is evidence of a solar composition for at least part of the
        martian interior[2]. This signature occurs with varying amounts of fissionderived
        xenon[3]. The isotopic fractionation of xenon in the martian atmosphere[4]
        is similar to that of the Earth. In contrast to the Earth, however, the martian
        atmosphere is more radiogenic than its interior, testifying to significant
        differences between the early histories of volatiles (especially iodine and
        xenon) on the two planets. However, there are inherent limitations to our
        developing understanding imposed by the use of martian meteorites. In addition
        to the lack of geological context for our investigations, the samples are
        exposed to cosmic rays for several million years during transit to the Earth.
        This leads to the production of spallation isotopes depending on the abundance
        of appropriate target elements. For xenon, this in fact led to the identification
        of the host phase of the interior component in Nakhla[5]. However, the high
        concentrations of target elements for He and Ne production mean that the signatures
        of these elements in martian reservoirs are very poorly constrained.. In addition
        to helping us define models of martian evolution, noble gas analyses can make
        other important contributions. The Ar-Ar technique based on decay of 40 K
        to 40 Ar will play a significant role in determining absolute ages and calibrating
        the cratering timescale provided appropriate samples are selected. The Ar-Ar
        technique requires neutron irradiation, that also allows cosmic ray exposure
        ages to be determined based on the production of 36 Ar from Ca, while noble
        gas isotopes produced by neutron capture allow relative abundances of the
        halogens Cl, Br and I to be derived. Thus, noble gas analysis will allow a
        detailed understanding of the volatile evolution of Mars to be developed.
        Sample Wish List: Constraining planetary evolution depends on the characterization
        of planetary reservoirs. To this end, a returned atmospheric sample is crucial
        to allow both detailed comparison with the heavy element composition understood
        from martian meteorite analyses (hence addressing atmospheric evolution) and
        the first tight constraints on the isotopic signatures of the light isotopes.
        An in situ atmospheric measurement is unlikely to have the required precision
        (e.g. Viking), but would allow the issue of contamination between sample collection
        and analysis to be addressed. Understanding of the martian interior is likely
        to be best addressed through analysis of igneous rocks. Within 3 m of the
        surface the cosmic ray flux is greater than that at the Earth\u2019s surface.
        Combined with low erosion rates this suggests deep samples will be required
        to preserve the signatures of parent reservoirs against overprinting by spallation.
        The solution is to seek either buried or recently exposed samples, or samples
        from recent lava flows. Dating techniques applied to sedimentary rocks tend
        to yield ambiguous results, thus calibration of the cratering timescale will
        also require suitable samples of igneous rock. However, the halogen composition
        of sedimentary rocks deposited from water can potentially play an important
        role in understanding the history of the parent water body. Technology: The
        current state-of-the-art in noble gas mass spectrometry is commercially available
        multicollector , electron impact instrumentation and experimental, element
        specific resonance ionization, time-offlight instruments for xenon and krypton,
        all of which are available in Manchester. Detection limits of ~1000 atoms
        are achievable, but for martian samples 10 5 \u2013 10 6", "venue": "", "year":

        an expanded insulin signaling network.", "abstract": "Insulin resistance is
        one of the dominant symptoms of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Although the molecular
        mechanisms leading to this resistance are largely unknown, experimental data
        support that the insulin signaling pathway is impaired in patients who are
        insulin resistant. To identify novel components/modulators of the insulin
        signaling pathway, we designed siRNAs targeting over 300 genes and tested
        the effects of knocking down these genes in an insulin-dependent, anti-lipolysis
        assay in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. For 126 genes, significant changes in free fatty
        acid release were observed. However, due to off-target effects (in addition
        to other limitations), high-throughput RNAi-based screens in cell-based systems
        generate significant amounts of noise. Therefore, to obtain a more reliable
        set of genes from the siRNA hits in our screen, we developed and applied a
        novel network-based approach that elucidates the mechanisms of action for
        the true positive siRNA hits. Our analysis results in the identification of
        a core network underlying the insulin signaling pathway that is more significantly
        enriched for genes previously associated with insulin resistance than the
        set of genes annotated in the KEGG database as belonging to the insulin signaling
        pathway. We experimentally validated one of the predictions, S1pr2, as a novel
        candidate gene for T2D.", "venue": "Genome Research", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

        but not sufficient for the development of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes results
        when pancreatic beta-cells fail to compensate for insulin resistance by increasing
        insulin production through an expansion of beta-cell mass or increased insulin
        secretion. Communication between insulin target tissues and beta-cells may
        initiate this compensatory response. Correlated changes in gene expression
        between tissues can provide evidence for such intercellular communication.
        We profiled gene expression in six tissues of mice from an obesity-induced
        diabetes-resistant and a diabetes-susceptible strain before and after the
        onset of diabetes. We studied the correlation structure of mRNA abundance
        and identified 105 co-expression gene modules. We provide an interactive gene
        network model showing the correlation structure between the expression modules
        within and among the six tissues. This resource also provides a searchable
        database of gene expression profiles for all genes in six tissues in lean
        and obese diabetes-resistant and diabetes-susceptible mice, at 4 and 10 weeks
        of age. A cell cycle regulatory module in islets predicts diabetes susceptibility.
        The module predicts islet replication; we found a strong correlation between
        2 H 2 O incorporation into islet DNA in vivo and the expression pattern of
        the cell cycle module. This pattern is highly correlated with that of several
        individual genes in insulin target tissues, including IGF2, which has been
        shown to promote beta-cell proliferation, suggesting that these genes may
        provide a link between insulin resistance and beta-cell proliferation. Introduction
        Type 2 diabetes is a disorder that involves an increased demand for insulin
        brought about by insulin resistance, together with a failure to compensate
        with sufficient insulin production. Although Insulin resistance occurs in
        most obese individuals, diabetes is generally forestalled through compensation
        with increased insulin. This \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Genetic inheritance of gene expression in human cell lines.", "abstract":
        "Combining genetic inheritance information, for both molecular profiles and
        complex traits, is a promising strategy not only for detecting quantitative
        trait loci (QTLs) for complex traits but for understanding which genes, pathways,
        and biological processes are also under the influence of a given QTL. As a
        primary step in determining the feasibility of such an approach in humans,
        we present the largest survey to date, to our knowledge, of the heritability
        of gene-expression traits in segregating human populations. In particular,
        we measured expression for 23,499 genes in lymphoblastoid cell lines for members
        of 15 Centre d''Etude du Polymorphisme Humain (CEPH) families. Of the total
        set of genes, 2,340 were found to be expressed, of which 31% had significant
        heritability when a false-discovery rate of 0.05 was used. QTLs were detected
        for 33 genes on the basis of at least one P value <.000005. Of these, 13 genes
        possessed a QTL within 5 Mb of their physical location. Hierarchical clustering
        was performed on the basis of both Pearson correlation of gene expression
        and genetic correlation. Both reflected biologically relevant activity taking
        place in the lymphoblastoid cell lines, with greater coherency represented
        in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database (KEGG) pathways than in
        Gene Ontology database pathways. However, more pathway coherence was observed
        in KEGG pathways when clustering was based on genetic correlation than when
        clustering was based on Pearson correlation. As more expression data in segregating
        populations are generated, viewing clusters or networks based on genetic correlation
        measures and shared QTLs will offer potentially novel insights into the relationship
        among genes that may underlie complex traits.", "venue": "American Journal

        in mammalian systems is one of the primary goals in biological research, especially

        network reconstruction algorithm, derived from classic Bayesian network methods,
        that utilizes naturally occurring genetic variations as a source of perturbations
        to elucidate the network. This algorithm incorporates relative transcript

        scoring function of maximum likelihood commonly used in Bayesian network reconstruction
        problems. The utility of this novel algorithm is demonstrated via application
        to liver gene expression data from a segregating mouse population. We demonstrate
        that the network derived from these data using our novel network reconstruction
        algorithm is able to capture causal associations between genes that result
        in increased predictive power, compared to more classically reconstructed

        Data Processing Methods and Experiment Designs", "abstract": "MOTIVATION\nThere
        is a very large and growing level of effort toward improving the platforms,
        experiment designs, and data analysis methods for microarray expression profiling.
        Along with a growing richness in the approaches there is a growing confusion
        among most scientists as to how to make objective comparisons and choices
        between them for different applications. There is a need for a standard framework
        for the microarray community to compare and improve analytical and statistical
        methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe report on a microarray data set comprising 204 in-situ
        synthesized oligonucleotide arrays, each hybridized with two-color cDNA samples
        derived from 20 different human tissues and cell lines. Design of the approximately
        24 000 60mer oligonucleotides that report approximately 2500 known genes on
        the arrays, and design of the hybridization experiments, were carried out
        in a way that supports the performance assessment of alternative data processing
        approaches and of alternative experiment and array designs. We also propose
        standard figures of merit for success in detecting individual differential
        expression changes or expression levels, and for detecting similarities and
        differences in expression patterns across genes and experiments. We expect
        this data set and the proposed figures of merit will provide a standard framework
        for much of the microarray community to compare and improve many analytical
        and statistical methods relevant to microarray data analysis, including image
        processing, normalization, error modeling, combining of multiple reporters
        per gene, use of replicate experiments, and sample referencing schemes in
        measurements based on expression change.\n\n\nAVAILABILITY/SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\nExpression

        The aim of this research was to explore the transition pathways of transition\u2010aged
        youth out of child and adolescent mental health services in Perth, Western
        Australia. A secondary aim was to identify factors that have some impact upon
        the transition process. Method Cases discharged from seven child and adolescent
        mental health community clinics in the Perth metropolitan area, from 1 June
        2004 to 30 June 2013, at transition age (16\u201325 years of age), were examined
        retrospectively. Two hundred and forty\u2010five cases met the selection criteria
        and were reviewed on the Psychiatric Services Online Information System. Results
        Four specific pathways of referral and acceptance into an adult mental health
        service were identified: not referred, referred with immediate engagement,
        referred with delayed engagement, and referred with no engagement and not
        accepted. Principal discharge diagnosis, length of stay, and housing situation
        on discharge were all found to influence likelihood of referral. Only principal
        discharge diagnosis was found to influence successful acceptance into an adult
        mental health service. Conclusions The factors found to influence transition
        pathways in the present study were largely consistent with findings from the
        UK. Findings of the present research can assist clinicians to make more informed
        decisions when discussing transition with clients. More broadly, findings
        can be used by policy makers to support the formation and maintenance of transition

        between appraisals of the physical environment with the subjective experience
        of consumers, and work satisfaction of clinicians, in Child and Adolescent
        Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Design, setting, and outcome measures: A survey
        of clinicians, parent/guardians, and child/adolescents was conducted across
        eight community CAMHS in Western Australia. Respondents evaluated the waiting
        room and therapy rooms on a number of environmental attributes, and factor
        analysis was carried out to confirm that these ratings loaded on an overall
        appraisal of the physical environment measure. This measure was then correlated
        with self-reported subjective experience of consumers, and overall work satisfaction
        of staff members. Results: Clinicians were found to be much more critical
        of the physical environment compared with consumers. Moderate associations
        were found between appraisal of the physical environment and subjective experience
        of consumers. A strong positive association was found between clinician appraisal
        of the physical environment and overall work satisfaction. Conclusions: The
        present study adds to the limited existing research arguing for the important
        role that the physical environment can have upon both consumer and staff experience
        in mental health settings. The present study provides empirical evidence to
        justify steps being taken to enhance the physical environment in mental health
        clinics. The inter-relationship between physical environment attributes suggests
        there is potential for managers to improve the overall perception of clinic
        space via relatively small actions (e.g., adding a nice piece of artwork).",

        practices and experiences with SPC.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThere were 420 valid responses,
        a response rate of 31%. Participants confirmed three types of SPC procedures
        in operation: (1) 355 (85%) having used verbal no-suicide assurances (NSAs);
        (2) 317 (76%) using verbal no-suicide agreements (NSAg); and, (3) 154 (37%)
        using written no-suicide contracts (NSC). The profiled procedures and their
        clinical application indicate that participants perceived differences in the
        diagnostic, therapeutic, and medico-legal utility of all three SPC procedures.
        Importantly, SPC procedures were shown to have a multifaceted potential for
        detrimental outcomes for patients and practitioners.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUntil
        now, SPC had represented a poorly understood and remains a questionable clinical
        practice intervention. Education initiatives are required that alert mental
        health practitioners to the dangers of SPC for patients and practitioners
        alike, and to present alternative interventions containing less risk.", "venue":

        Presenting to General Practice: A Pilot Study", "abstract": "Objectives: The
        study sought to determine: (i) the prevalence rates of psychological distress
        and suicidal ideation among 15\u201324\u2013year-old patients presenting to
        general practice; and (ii) the relationship between patients'' presenting
        complaints and their levels of psychological distress and suicidal ideation.
        Method: This was a pilot study designed to sample patients aged 15\u201324
        years presenting consecutively to general practitioners during a 4\u2013week
        period. The study was set among five general practices in the western suburbs
        of Perth, Western Australia. Participants included five general practitioners
        and 69 patients aged 15\u201324 years. Main outcome measures were the General
        Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression
        Scale (CES-D) and the Depressive Symptom Inventory-Suicidality Subscale (DSI-SS).
        Results: One-third of patients scored above the cut-off of the GHQ-12,31.9%
        above the cut-off of the CES-D and 20.3% above the cut-off of the DSI-SS.
        The majority of patients (87.5%) presented with medical complaints. Of these,
        26.8%, 23.2% and 21.4% scored above the cut-offs of the GHQ-12, CES-D and
        DSI-SS, respectively. Patients presenting with psychological complaints (12.5%)
        were significantly more likely to score above the cut-off of the CES-D. Conclusions:
        In this pilot study, patients aged 15\u201324 presenting to five general practices
        had relatively high levels of psychological distress and suicidal ideation.
        Of most concern were those presenting with medical complaints and who also
        had high levels of unreported psychological distress.", "venue": "Australian

        summary Many conservation initiatives call for \u2018transformative change\u2019
        to counter biodiversity loss, climate change, and injustice. The term connotes
        fundamental, broad, and durable changes to human relationships with nature.
        However, if oversimplified or overcomplicated, or not focused enough on power
        and the political action necessary for change, associated initiatives can
        perpetuate or exacerbate existing crises. This article aims to help practitioners
        deliberately catalyze and steer transformation processes. It provides a theoretically
        and practically grounded definition of \u2018transformative conservation\u2019,
        along with six strategic, interlocking recommendations. These cover systems
        pedagogy, political mobilization, inner transformation, as well as planning,
        action, and continual adjustment. Technical summary Calls for \u2018transformative
        change\u2019 point to the fundamental reorganization necessary for global
        conservation initiatives to stem ecological catastrophe. However, the concept
        risks being oversimplified or overcomplicated, and focusing too little on
        power and the political action necessary for change. Accordingly, its intersection
        with contemporary biodiversity and climate change mitigation initiatives needs
        explicit deliberation and clarification. This article advances the praxis
        of \u2018transformative conservation\u2019 as both (1) a desired process that
        rethinks the relationships between individuals, society, and nature, and restructures
        systems accordingly, and (2) a desired outcome that conserves biodiversity
        while justly transitioning to net zero emission economies and securing the
        sustainable and regenerative use of natural resources. It first reviews criticisms
        of area-based conservation targets, natural climate solutions, and nature-based
        solutions that are framed as transformative, including issues of ecological
        integrity, livelihoods, gender, equity, growth, power, participation, knowledge,
        and governance. It then substantiates six strategic recommendations designed
        to help practitioners deliberately steer transformation processes. These include
        taking a systems approach; partnering with political movements to achieve
        equitable and just transformation; linking societal with personal (\u2018inner\u2019)
        transformation; updating how we plan; facilitating shifts from diagnosis and
        planning to action; and improving our ability to adjust to transformation
        as it occurs. Social media summary Curious about stemming the global biodiversity

        recent interest in the concept of rewilding as a tool for nature conservation,
        but also confusion over the idea, which has limited its utility. We developed
        a unifying definition and 10 guiding principles for rewilding through a survey
        of 59 rewilding experts, a summary of key organizations\u2019 rewilding visions,
        and workshops involving over 100 participants from around the world. The guiding
        principles convey that rewilding exits on a continuum of scale, connectivity,
        and level of human influence and aims to restore ecosystem structure and functions
        to achieve a self\u2010sustaining autonomous nature. These principles clarify
        the concept of rewilding and improve its effectiveness as a tool to achieve
        global conservation targets, including those of the UN Decade on Ecosystem
        Restoration and post\u20102020 Global Biodiversity Framework. Finally, we
        suggest differences in rewilding perspectives lie largely in the extent to
        which it is seen as achievable and in specific interventions. An understanding
        of the context of rewilding projects is the key to success, and careful site\u2010specific

        "title": "Infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) dating of late-Holocene
        aeolian sands in the Mojave Desert, California, USA", "abstract": "A new method
        of dating potassium feldspar grains from aeolian sands is demonstrated. A
        luminescence signal is measured whilst the grains are stimulated in the near
        infrared at 880 nm. A surface sand sample gave an age of 40 \u00b1 15 years,
        showing that this method is able to provide ages for very young samples. Since
        the measurement of an infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) signal can take
        place with a short infrared exposure, the IRSL signal of the grains is not
        depleted; thus growth curves can be obtained for 5 mg sample aliquots. This
        procedure was exploited in this paper. Dates were obtained for 10 samples
        from the Kelso dune field as a demonstration of the applicability of the method
        in a desert environment where there is no material suitable for radiocarbon
        dating. Although the number of dates are limited, sand from an area at the
        eastern end of the dune field with crescentic dunes showing a different wind
        direction from that of today had an age of 4115 \u00b1 335 years, similar
        to the 3960 \u00b1 385 years for another sand unit nearby. At the western
        end of the dune field differently oriented crescentic dunes gave ages of 1540
        \u00b1 135 and 1470 \u00b1 145 years, indicating a different phase of aeolian
        activity. Reworking in the late Holocene is proposed for areas with dates

        "Abstract A relatively new luminescence dating technique, infra-red stimulated
        luminescence (IRSL), has been used to date dune sand from the Kelso Dunes,
        eastern Mojave Desert, California. This is the first time the technique has
        been applied to desert aeolian sands. The IRSL technique measures the time
        since sediment grains were last exposed to light, by sampling a highly light-sensitive
        signal which reduces rapidly to a negligible level when so exposed. The technique
        can be used to date very young samples. Of the ten samples dated, the surface
        sample gave an age of 40 \u00b1 17 years, while subsurface samples gave high-precision
        middle and late Holocene dates. These results, obtained from the upper 8 m
        of the sand mass, indicate significant aeolian activity during the later part
        of the Holocene. Clustering of IRSL ages from the data so far available suggests
        that the aeolian activity may have been episodic.", "venue": "Geological Society

        frontier in the prevention and treatment of epilepsy. A substantial body of
        evidence supports a key role for neuroinflammation in epileptogenesis, the
        pathological process that leads to the development and progression of spontaneous
        recurrent epileptic seizures. It is also well recognized that traumatic brain
        injury (TBI) induces a vigorous neuroinflammatory response and that a significant
        proportion of TBI patients suffer from debilitating post-traumatic epilepsy.
        The complement system is a potent effector of innate immunity and a significant
        contributor to secondary tissue damage and to epileptogenesis following central
        nervous system injury. Several therapeutic agents targeting the complement
        system are already on the market to treat other central nervous system disorders
        or are well-advanced in their development. The purpose of this review is to
        summarise findings on complement activation in experimental TBI and epilepsy
        models, highlighting the potential of drug repurposing in the development
        of therapeutics to ameliorate post-traumatic epileptogenesis.", "venue": "Journal

        loss through axonal atrophy and neuronal death are also part of the disease

        containing neurons causes the cognitive decline in Alzheimer''s disease patients

        using tractography in a surgical mouse model of Alzheimer\u2019s disease [2].",

        serious cancer; in the UK 50% of patients undergo partial or complete penectomy
        resulting in far-reaching consequences.\n\n\nAIM\nTo examine the impact of
        penectomy for men and make recommendations for rehabilitation and patient/carer
        support services.\n\n\nMETHOD\nA small-scale qualitative study using interpretative
        phenomenological analysis (IPA) was carried out. A purposive sample of men
        with penile cancer (n = 9) at least 18 months post surgery were recruited.
        A male researcher interviewed them.\n\n\nRESULTS\nKey themes were: the cancer
        journey; support and relationships; life stage and life review; and masculinity
        and self-image.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is not unexpected to find that men should
        have changed life experiences following penile cancer surgery. However, the
        far-reaching and insidious nature of post-treatment changes reported here
        have implications for clinical practice and show that there is a need for
        further research in this area.", "venue": "Nursing Times", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

        with head injury and injury type as independent variables. Body image and
        psycho-emotional health were evaluated using self-report questionnaires. Disability
        and cognitive impairment were measured using a mixture of self-report, cognitive
        testing and clinical notes. Results indicated that males with ABI had significantly
        lower self-esteem and body dissatisfaction on a number of items relating to
        physical and sexual functioning. There were significant differences in body
        image between stroke and TBI, but there was no corresponding relationship
        with psycho-emotional health. These body image differences might be explained
        by age. The finding that ABI has a negative effect on body image and that
        this relates to psycho-emotional health should be investigated further, perhaps
        being included in future rehabilitation strategies.", "venue": "Brain Injury",

        series of questionnaires, containing items pertaining to attitudes and behavior

        analysis revealed two underlying constructs. The first reflected the desire
        to be muscular and and to such goal-oriented behaviors. The second reflected
        perceived positive attributes of muscularity, including feelings of masculinity,
        enhanced confidence, and greater attractiveness. Following preliminary studies,
        a final version of the Swansea Muscularity Attitudes Questionnaire was developed
        and administered to 303 normal male subjects. Factor analysis of these data
        confirmed the dual-construct model. The two subscales of this questionnaire
        (Drive for Muscularity and Positive Attributes of Muscularity) displayed high

        "This study is about the physical and spiritual aspects of running. In addition
        to the human physical activity of running, there is a special reference to
        God-consciousness. Although the paper reflects an African, Christian, psychological
        bias, from an interfaith perspective, it concerns a simple, natural, human
        activity, within a broader energetic field of consciousness, which is usually
        and simply referred to as Love. The deliberate choice of the broad generic
        terms, God, or Godhead, is intended to include such terms as Allah, Brahman,
        Tao, Spirit, Divine, etc. While the terms \u201cself\u201d and \u201csoul\u201d
        may be used in different ways by various wisdom, spiritual and religious traditions,
        here they essentially refer to the interior, social and spiritual dimensions
        of human relationships. The study adopts a phenomenological, psychological,
        and biographical methodology with special reference to the spirituality of
        running as experienced by participants and reported by the heroic figures
        of Allyson Felix, Eliud Kipchoge, and Teilhard de Chardin, respectively. Its
        humble intention is to inspire all concerning the benefits of physical activity
        in general and running in particular, for physical, mental, social, and spiritual

        phase synchronicity and interconnection of various bodily subsystems, which
        is also comprehensible based on our bodily development during embryogenesis.

        as the more recent one on coping with COVID-19. A convenience sample of twelve
        participants was asked to describe their understanding of the role of the
        ancestors in healing. Respondents indicated that although ancestors are typically
        not healers, unless they occupied healing roles in life such as Shembe, in
        their closer connection to the Creator/God, they play various roles in healing.
        The most important roles were of guidance, protection, direction, advice,

        of these healing roles are discussed with special reference to Zulu indigenous

        2019 to 31 July 2021. This consisted of coherence and achievement data from
        the HeartMath Inner Balance application (app), as well as distance and activity
        data from the Fitbit app. The qualitative phase consisted of the selection
        and illustration of meditation sessions documented over lockdown. 3. Results:
        The highly significant increases in physical activity and meditation coherence
        and achievement collectively indicated significant health promotion over the
        COVID-19 Lockdown period. Subtle energetic, experiential descriptions of meditation
        apprehensions resonated and supported these quantitative findings. 4. Conclusions:
        COVID-19 lockdown has meant transformation, humility, and reordering of priorities.
        The meditation descriptions amplified information from the HeartMath and Fitbit
        electronic devices, together co-creating conscious, embodied, relationship
        science for discussion, instruction, and further research.", "venue": "",

        it refers to psychology in, of, for, and from Africa, on, by and for Africans.
        Third, it has much to offer psychology in other continents. Fourth, the Greek
        philosophy of love has considerable African origins. Fifth, the concept of
        Ubuntu both relates to and extends the notion of agape or unconditional love,

        during sleep may be even more important in illness prevention and health promotion.
        We investigated whether it was possible to develop an alternative effective
        technology: the Cardiac Coherence Index (CCI), for sleep analysis. The CCI
        is based on heart inter-beat interval spectral entropy and autonomic nervous
        system resonance analysis. We tested the hypothesis that the CCI could be
        a way to assess sleep quality and eventually as a tool to assess consciousness
        states during sleep. Our analysis suggests that high CCI corresponds to deep
        sleep stage, low CCI to awake state, and medium CCI to dream state. These
        findings further suggest that the CCI method is potentially a useful tool
        for the study of consciousness and as a home-based system for sleep management.",

        technological advances, humanity\u2019s endemic destructiveness continues.
        Planetary healing needs motivated this research. The aim was an empirical
        and heuristic phenomenological investigation into and an evaluation of the
        theoretical and technological implications of the HeartMath Global Coherence
        Initiative. The single case study, and limited amount of data, indicated the
        null hypothesis. Methodology included HeartMath Inner Balance tool and newly
        developed Global Coherence application (app). Data collection involved linked
        empirical measures and experiential journaling. Quantitative data analysis,
        which consisted of statistical analysis of correlations between six existing
        Global Coherence magnetometers and empirical measures of meditation records,
        from Inner Balance and Global coherence apps, respectively, yielded unexpected
        findings, both significant and insignificant, in the form of trends towards
        global and local group coherence, respectively. Qualitative findings essentially
        revealed variations on the, interrelated, consciousness themes of wholeness,
        holistic healing, energy healing and meditation. In addition to various limitations
        and implications, interpretation of integrative findings indicated theoretical
        and practical support for the HeartMath mission and vision of developing and
        promoting personal, social and global coherence.", "venue": "International

        evidence on the efficacy of an Ubuntu type HeartMath intervention for the
        purpose of facilitating social coherence and spirit at work. The study employed
        a pre-test and post-test, mixed methods design with 17 students and staff
        of an education unit (women\u2009=\u200910; range 24 to 58 years). Participants
        completed a brief Ubuntu HeartMath workshop focused on promoting their sense
        of social coherence and work spirit, with pre-test and post-test measures
        of psychophysiological coherence, social coherence and work spirit, as well
        as written experiential evaluative descriptions of their personal growth indicators
        from the workshop. Wilcoxon signed rank tests for changes in psychophysiological
        coherence, social coherence, and work spirit indicators were positive. This
        suggests that the Ubuntu Heartmath workshop had efficacy in enhancing quality
        of work life. Thematic analysis of the written, experiential, evaluative descriptions
        also suggested that participants derived benefit in their sense of work place

        problems confronting planet Earth. Its goal is to promote local and global
        coherence, research and health. An integral theoretical, positive psychological
        paradigm is used to introduce HeartMath and Global Coherence Initiatives as
        evidence based interventions for promoting coherence, research, health and
        well-being. Interventions are\u00a0 essentially scientific advances on cardiorespiratory
        based methods which have been used for millennia in various wisdom,\u00a0
        knowledge and spiritual traditions such as ancestral consciousness and reverence,
        Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Taoism,\u00a0 Christianity and Islam. The article
        reviews research evidence in relation to psychophysiological coherence, which
        is\u00a0 characterised by a heart rhythm pattern of elevated amplitude in
        low\u00a0 frequency heart rate variability of around 0.1 Hz. This is\u00a0
        associated with\u00a0 synchronisation between various physiological systems,

        enhanced spirituality, effective prayer, personal, social and global coherence
        and health. For example, research evidence is provided for the effectiveness
        of an African heart breath healing method, specifically developed\u00a0 around
        the concept Shiso, an\u00a0 ancient isiZulu respectful (hlonipha) term for
        a human being, which became an acronym for Spirit (umoya), Heart (inhlizyo),
        Image (umcabango), Soul (umphefumulo) and Oneness (ubunye). Subsequent independent
        and collaborative South African research, validating various HeartMath techniques,
        is described. This includes an African Global Coherence Initiative Site, established
        on a private game reserve in Kwa-Zulu Natal, providing valuable research data,
        applicable to all academic fields and scientific\u00a0 disciplines, which
        is freely available for use. It is concluded that many more integral healing
        approaches are needed, as is\u00a0 collaboration between all caring stakeholder

        an individual the opportunity to enter a spiritual community \nadding meaning

        Previously \nestablished dimensions of sports fanship (group affiliation,
        psychological commitment and team \nidentification) share characteristics
        commonly associated with religious or spiritual affiliation \nindicating that
        fans may generate substantial life meaning from observing sporting encounters.
        In the \npresent study, 12 male basketball fans (M=32.42; SD=7.97) completed
        semi-structured interviews \nimmediately prior to viewing a competitive match
        at the 2011 European Basketball Championships \n(Vilnius, Lithuania). Interviews
        were structured under four headings; 1) the most memorable moment \nas a basketball

        Sherwood (2012). Bunbury, Australia: Sophia Publications. ISBN: 978-0-9804044-2-5This
        is not a conventional counseling book detailing ICD or DSM diagnostic schemas
        and cognitive behavioural therapeutic techniques. Instead, it clearly articulates
        its own original and descriptive, conceptual and diagnostic, expressive and
        therapeutic language. For example, light figure resources and/or archetypes
        such as Buddha, Christ, St Teresa or Mandela may be chosen by a client for
        use in vibrant energetic therapeutic sequences to transform pathologies existing
        in past life and/or cellular memories in the form of imprints, implants and
        discamates (having no material body or form). Although such terms may be new
        for many conventional counselors, they may find them more descriptive, valuable,
        relevant and universally applicable than any others they have encountered
        to date.The author, Dr Sherwood, is a well-known Australian academic who was
        one of the founders of the IndoPacific Journal of Phenomenology. In addition
        to supervising doctoral students at Edith Cowan University, Western Australia,
        Trish, as she is affectionately known, is also Director of Sophia College,
        supervising over 20 free community counselling services run by students and
        graduates of Sophia College''s holistic counselling programmes in various
        regions in Australia and internationally. She has hosted many South African
        academics, professionals and students over the past fifteen years as well
        as having visited South Africa on National Research Foundation International
        Science and other Grants hosted by Zululand and Rhodes Universities in 2004,
        2007 and 2012.This second book on holistic counselling, a more indepth sequel
        to Holistic Counselling: A New Vision for Mental Health (Sherwood, 2007a),
        is a culminating point in Dr Sherwood''s training and counselling practice
        over the past twenty years. She is also the author of such literary gems as
        The Buddha is in the Street (2003), The Healing Art of Clay Therapy (2004),
        Search for your Self: Pathways to Personal Growth (2010), Infertility to Fertility:
        the Journey of the Psyche (2007b), Emotional Literacy: The Heart of the Classroom
        (2008) and Clay Therapy Healing Rwandan Genocide (2012). These books are typically
        based on over 20 000 personal or supervised student client cases that Dr Sherwood''s
        has worked with as Sophia College Director or in her own busy clinical practice
        as a Mental Health accredited Social Worker specializing in trauma and abuse
        recovery, anxiety disorders and stress management.In simple terms, the shadow
        is our other side. It has appeared in various guises, forms, states and stages
        throughout documented history. For example, as demons from Hades for Homer
        and Virgil, as a devil that tempted Buddha and Jesus Christ, as Dante''s Inferno,
        and as Freud''s destructive sexual and aggressive drives, culminating in human
        violence, appropriately recognized as basic cause of all illness. The shadow
        is called by its proper name by Jung, Wilber and other authors. Moreover,
        it has many other names, such as evil, sorcery and witchcraft, all of which
        are manifestations of intentionality, a core notion of Buddhism, which is
        deeply understood by Dr Sherwood and forms one of the underlying frameworks
        for this book.In Hindu philosophy, the distinction is made between guru and
        pandit, or counselor and teacher, and this distinction may be invoked to describe
        the relatively distinct approaches of Carl Jung and Ken Wilber with regard
        to the phenomenology and function of the shadow. Encouraged by her ongoing
        research, teaching and community counselling commitments, Sherwood''s text
        manages to combine many of the oceans and streams, wetness and water molecules
        of the theoretical and practical approaches of both the guru and the pandit,
        which makes this book unique indeed. Hopefully, this brief review will provide
        some taste of this for the reader. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "referenceCount":

        three-phase longitudinal research project exploring the \u2018lived experiences\u2019
        of patients with chronic low-back pain (CLBP) in the United Kingdom. Qualitative,
        semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight participants 1 and 2
        years after the first interviews and after attendance at a medically staffed
        chronic pain clinic. The transcribed accounts were analysed using interpretative
        phenomenological analysis and results compared with the data from time one.
        A main challenge for participants was managing constant unchanging pain experiences
        and loss across all areas of their lives. Some participants held consistent
        biomedical understandings of CLBP, continued to focus on the physicality of
        their pain and adopt a narrow range of behavioural-focused coping strategies
        and maintained a strong loss orientation. It is proposed that these elements
        demonstrated embodied experiences and contributed to comprehensive enmeshment
        of self and pain with little re-establishment of any behavioural activity.
        In comparison, participants who had experienced pain relief due to physical
        treatments showed increased use of mind\u2013body strategies, a future orientation
        and were considered to be less enmeshed in their experiences. These changes
        were discussed in relation to the relationship between pain remission and
        illness beliefs.", "venue": "Psychology and Health", "year": 2013, "referenceCount":

        explored phenomenological and neurophysiologic, individual and collective

        mean age of 48 years and an age range from 21 to 85 years. Participants meditated

        the form of electroencephalographic (EEG), electromyographic (EMG), blood
        volume pulse (BVP) and respiratory activity were recorded. A phenomenological
        analysis indicated that the meditation process generally involved a movement
        from body to mind to spirit as evident in reports of an increasingly relaxed,
        contented and focused state of consciousness characterised by Christian Trinitarian
        imagery, wonder, surrender, peace, bliss, openness and formlessness. The neuropsychological

        an original psychological theme in Southern African indigenous healing involving
        recognition of Spirit as Source of Self that extends into transpersonal realms.

        "Each article in this special section of the Journal of Psychology in Africa
        has a particular focus on the psychology of indigenous healing. Articles are
        arranged in order from those that are theoretical or conceptual to those that
        are more practical and applied. The first is a general introduction to some
        older and newer themes that characterize the perennial nature of the psychology
        of indigenous healing in Africa. The second focuses on particular cultural
        issues that inevitably pose challenges for the integration of traditional
        and modern health care systems. The third explores the archetype of the Self
        in Jungian analysts and African diviners. The fourth illuminates the relationship
        between spirituality/religion and antiretroviral therapy in a longitudinal,
        empirical study of patients. The fifth consists of a brief report on meanings
        attributed to an animal skin wristband (isiphandla) in KwaZulu-Natal, South
        Africa. The sixth and final article concerns some theoretical and practical
        implications of integrating ancestral consciousness into conventional counselling.",

        energy healing as holistic, contextual and essentially psychological. In order

        of the universe as an interrelated whole, of illness as a disruption or stagnation
        of energy\u00a0 patterns, which need continual harmonisation for optimal health,
        and of a universal energy to which everyone has access, particularly via breathing
        and meditation techniques. Other themes include universal healing patterns
        such as dialogue, spirituality, shared worldview, communal context, cultural
        compatibility, common expectations, emotional arousal, information exchange,

        "title": "The influence of yoga therapy on anxiety", "abstract": "The stressful
        lifestyles that accompany modern living generate levels of anxiety that become
        a major concern in society. Psychopharmacological medication and psychotherapy
        for anxiety is expensive for government health departments as well as for
        individual consumers. Although the value of yoga as a beneficial and cost
        effective therapy for anxiety has long been advocated, there have been very
        few well designed scientific studies in this regard. Therefore the aim of
        this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of yoga therapy on anxiety
        perceptions and experiences. The research hypothesis that yoga could decrease
        such anxiety was investigated by comparing two groups, an experimental group
        of 18 participants that \npractised yoga and a control group of 19 participants
        that did not practise yoga, over a duration of three months, The \nresearch
        design included quantitative and qualitative research methods. Quantitative
        results from the Beck Anxiety \nInventory (BAI) indicated that, although regular
        yoga therapy was associated with significant decreases in anxiety \nperceptions
        over time, these changes were not significant when compared with the control
        group. Therefore, no causative inferences can be made. Qualitative findings
        from thematic content analysis of participants\u2019 experiences suggested
        meaningful relief from anxiety over time, especially with regard to such themes
        as physicality, contentment, relaxation, breath control, mindfulness, transcendence
        and spirituality. Although further randomised controlled studies with larger
        samples are needed, this research provided some systematic evidence for yoga
        therapy as a significant and relatively cost effective intervention for anxiety
        reduction. \n \n Key Words: Yoga, therapy, anxiety, stress.", "venue": "",

        "The central thesis of this article was that the phenomenon of hope involves

        "title": "Book Review: Holistic Counselling: A New Vision for Mental Health",
        "abstract": "Every now and then a truly original book emerges. The valuable
        ''Holistic counselling'' by Patricia Sherwood achieves what it sets out to
        do. It provides a new vision for mental health, in a way that mixes profound
        thought and cutting edge interdisciplinary research findings with decisive
        action sequences that detail precise, replicable steps to be followed in counselling
        persons with various disorders, both those that are perennial and those particularly
        endemic to contemporary humanity. Sherwood is a brilliant academic at Edith
        Cowan University who founded the Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology, a
        highly rated peer review journal, which is currently co-hosted by Edith Cowan
        University in Western Australia and Rhodes University in South Africa. Besides
        teaching and supervising postgraduate students at Edith Cowan University,
        Trish, as she is affectionately known, is also Director of Sophia College,
        Western Australia, supervising over 20 free community counsel\u00ad ling services
        run by students and graduates of Sophia College''s holistic counselling programme.
        She has hosted various South African academics, professionals and students
        over the past ten years as well as visiting South Africa on National Research
        Foundation International Science grants hosted by Zululand and Rhodes universities.
        This book on holistic counselling, a successor to a highly ac\u00ad claimed
        book on the Healing Art of Clay Therapy, is a culmination of her training
        and counselling practice over the past decade. It is outstanding in its applicability
        for both postgraduate and under\u00ad graduate counselling theory and practice.
        As a document, the book is divided into twelve chapters, each of which is
        preceded by ten archetypal resource figures who set the theme for the subsequent
        discussion. These resource figures are the Sophia, who personifies wisdom
        through healing in Chapter 1 and the celebration of the dance of conscious
        interconnected being in Chapter 12; the Buddha, who representsbreath, as first
        language and sign of presence in body, mind and spirit in Chapter 2 and freedom
        from restrictions in Chapter 7; Shiva, representing other languages of sound,
        colour, movement and gesture in Chapter 3; Tara, the great Tibetan bodhisattva
        with her loving emanations representing resources, archetypes and symbols
        in Chapter 4; Durga for developing and protecting boundaries in Chapter 5;
        the Black Madonna for transforming woundedness and reclaiming innocence in
        Chapter 6; Kwan Yin representing compassion, forgiveness and for replacing
        guilt and shame with serenity in Chapter 8; Kali for reclaiming the shadow
        in Chapter 9; Isis for healing addictions and freedom from repetitive energy
        patterns and dysfunctional systems in Chapter 10; and the Queen of Sheba for
        fulfilling one''s destiny, vocation and bringing one''s gifts to the world
        in Chapter 11. Although the book is mainly based on Rudolf Steiner'' s anthroposophical
        medical model, it could just as well have been based on Husserlian phenomenological,
        Buddhist, feminist, new age, energetic, expressive therapeutic or other models
        of counselling, so richly does it weave related theoretical tapestries into
        the content. I had to update on Steiner''s form of spiritual science, which
        integrates western perspectives on eastern wisdom traditions in their focus
        on various forms of energy healing. Steiner distinguished four main energy
        layers or bodies which surround the physical body; the etheric/health, emotional/astral,
        mental/I am and causal/I AM energy bodies. It is interesting to examine these
        interpenetrating energy bodies in relation to both earlier psychology schools
        of psycho\u00ad analysis, behaviourism, humanistic and transpersonal psychology
        as well as Ken Wilber''s writings and maps on inclusive psychology and subtle
        bodies, which are available on the web. For example, I found the astral body
        trauma system difficult to understand until I began to view the concept in",

        breath psychology is an ancient applied science. While it is more obvious

        of the world, it remains a foundation for modern forms of psychology, however
        academic and professional these have become, in the so-called first world
        countries. The aim of this article is to reintroduce this original psychology
        from a pragmatic, fundamental and applied perspective. Breath psychology fundamentals,
        which have been extolled for millennia in the form of various wisdom and spiritual
        traditions, are explicated in relation to the themes of consciousness, embodiment,
        ecology, spirituality and healing. Breath psychology applications are discussed
        with reference to health, sport and skills training. It is concluded that
        general breathing exercises constitute an immediate form of energy management,
        illness prevention and the basis for cost-effective public health promotion
        in both economically developed and developing countries. In an ecological

        ways in which movement may promote life and health. Ancient patterns of African
        communal life involve healthy, breath-coordinated movements and gestures in
        a mutual reciprocity of person-world relations. Traditional Zulu cultural
        forms of human movement, which promote life and health, such as play, martial
        arts and dance, remain widely practised, especially in rural areas of South
        Africa. Members of African Indigenous Churches build and impart communal spirituality
        through rhythmic dancing in healing circles. The psychology of such community
        healing through movement is of an original and universal form, as conveyed
        by the Greek concept of psyche or the South African Nguni concept of umoya,
        involving breath, soul and spirit. Such holistic African lessons teach movement
        for life and health, while empowering people to become more truly and fully
        human.", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "referenceCount": 11, "citationCount":

        form of psychology, still practiced internationally,\nhas its roots in African

        for example, a stroke or brain injury. The congenital form of PA is generally
        considered to be even less common. Beside a few single case reports and anecdotal
        mentioning of familial cases no data on the epidemiology exists. Following
        a questionnaire\u2010based screening in local secondary schools and at our
        medical faculty, candidates suspicious for PA underwent a semi\u2010structured
        interview followed by examinations of first degree relatives. Among 689 local
        pupils and medical students of our university we found 17 with congenital
        PA. This corresponds to a prevalence rate of 2.47% (95% CI 1.31\u20133.63).
        The frequency is among the highest known for a monogenic disorder. All those
        index subjects (n\u2009=\u200914) of the target group who agreed to further
        examinations of their family members had other first degree relatives with
        the same cognitive disorder. This study provides epidemiological evidence
        that congenital PA is a very common cognitive disorder which almost always
        runs in families. The segregation pattern of this hereditary prosopagnosia
        (HPA) is fully compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. \u00a9 2006

        "The value of various forms of physical activity, exercise and sport in health
        promotion is universally acknowledged. This research compared psychological
        wellbeing and physical self-perception of persons who regularly engage in
        various forms of physical activity, exercise and sport with a control group
        of non-exercisers. Different physical activities selected included health
        club exercises (mainly resistance training), hockey (a team sport), and running
        (mainly aerobic exercise). Main findings were that persons engaging in regular
        physical activity perceived themselves as having more autonomy, personal growth,
        environmental mastery, purpose in life, positive relations with others, self-acceptance,
        sport competence and conditioning than non-exercisers. Regular exercisers
        also attached more importance to sport, conditioning, body attractiveness
        and strength than non-exercisers. Hockey players perceived themselves as having
        more positive relations with others and sport competence than either health
        club members or runners. The relevance of these findings and further implications
        for health and sport psychological research and interventions were discussed.

        Perspective", "abstract": "In recent years, a culture of evidence-based, natural
        scientific, bio-medical and bio-mechanically orientated health-promoting physical
        activity packages has become popular, to promote health and prevent various
        illnesses associated with the violence and stress of contemporary planet earth,
        including the sedentary, technocratic lifestyles typical of economically developed
        countries. However, humanity has always promoted mental health through involvement
        in human movement in the form of an infinite variety of behaviours such as
        playing, running and dancing. Although the new evidence-based approach has
        scientific validity and undoubted value, considerations of health, holism
        and harmony also suggest the need for additional forms of discourse that represent
        more essential, original, meaningful experiences, and multicultural forms
        of human movement that promote mental health and welfare, perhaps more cost-effectively.
        The aim of this article is an explication of this conception and its public
        health implications, with special reference to guidelines for multicultural
        movement counsellors. Supportive evidence, related to the experience of movement,
        as well as mental health-promoting activities involving rhythmic, breath-co-ordinated,
        sociocultural exercises such as chi-gung and dance, is presented.", "venue":

        In the comparative investigation, health club members were more psychologically

        club members who exercised regularly over a period of two or more months increased

        psychological reality.The Zululand Community Psychology Project is a South

        among communities divided in terms of historical, colonial, racial, ethnic,
        political, gender, and other boundaries as well as promoting health and social
        change. The aim of this article is to evaluate the applicability of various
        models of community psychology used in this project.The initial quantitative
        investigation in the Zululand Community Psychology Project involved five coresearchers,
        who evaluated five community psychology models \u2014the mental health, social
        action, organizational, ecological, and phenomenological models\u2014in terms

        local gyms in the Richards Bay area of South Africa. Respondents were given
        feedback, and further counselling if needed, with regard to their scores on
        the various components as wellness and a global wellness percentage score.
        The correlations among wellness components were almost all highly significant.
        Findings also indicated a highly significant influence of regular exercise
        on the various components of wellness as operationally defined by various
        scores on the wellness profile and the final composite wellness percentage
        itself. Findings provide further support for the vital role that regular exercise
        plays in the promotion of mental health and wellness.", "venue": "", "year":

        "ABSTRACT. Although considered by most scholars as minor research, descriptive
        studies can make important contributions toward the development of simulation
        game research. Descriptive research studies are often simply case studies
        of the experiences of persons who have field tested, observed, or participated
        in a simulation game exercise. This kind of research contributes significantly
        as rich sources of testable hypotheses and potential explanatory variables.
        Secondly, descriptive studies may identify user problems that help avoid certain
        common errors in use, choice, or timing of simulation games. Thirdly, they
        may prove Useful in identifying or devising new evaluation methods. Finally,
        since many descriptive studies are written by researchers in specific academic
        fields, they may identify common discipline problems, help to clarify requisite
        skills and devise educational outcomes, and raise questions aboat sequencing
        of activities within courses. (Author/DE)", "venue": "", "year": 1975, "referenceCount":

        "title": "The blue suns of 1831: was the eruption of Ferdinandea, near Sicily,
        one of the largest volcanic climate forcing events of the nineteenth century?",
        "abstract": "Abstract. One of the largest climate forcing eruptions of the
        nineteenth century was, until recently, believed to have taken place at Babuyan
        Claro volcano, in the Philippines, in 1831. However, a recent investigation
        found no reliable evidence of such an eruption, suggesting that the 1831 eruption
        must have taken place elsewhere. A newly compiled dataset of reported observations
        of a blue, purple and green sun in August 1831 is here used to reconstruct
        the transport of a stratospheric aerosol plume from that eruption. The source
        of the aerosol plume is identified as the eruption of Ferdinandea, which took
        place about 50\u2009km off the south-west coast of Sicily (lat. 37.1\u00b0\u2009N.,
        long. 12.7\u00b0\u2009E.), in July and August 1831. The modest magnitude of
        this eruption, assigned a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 3, has commonly
        caused it to be discounted or overlooked when identifying the likely source
        of the stratospheric sulphate aerosol in 1831. It is proposed, however, that
        convective instability in the troposphere contributed to aerosol reaching
        the stratosphere and that the aerosol load was enhanced by addition of a sedimentary
        sulphur component to the volcanic plume. One of the largest climate forcing
        volcanic eruptions of the nineteenth century would thus effectively have been
        hiding in plain sight, arguably \u2018lowering the bar\u2019 for the types
        of eruptions capable of having a substantial climate forcing impact. Prior
        estimates of the mass of stratospheric sulphate aerosol responsible for the
        1831 Greenland ice-core sulphate deposition peaks which have assumed a source
        eruption at a low-latitude site will therefore have been overstated. The example
        presented in this paper serves as a useful reminder that VEI values were not
        intended to be reliably correlated with eruption sulphur yields unless supplemented
        with compositional analyses. It also underlines that eye-witness accounts
        of historical geophysical events should not be neglected as a source of valuable
        scientific data.\n", "venue": "", "year": 2021, "referenceCount": 158, "citationCount":

        "title": "Earth observation data and satellite InSAR for the remote monitoring
        of tailings storage facilities: a case study of Cadia Mine, Australia", "abstract":
        "Tailings storage facilities (TSFs) are an essential infrastructure of mineral
        processing, but they represent a significant physical, chemical and biological
        hazard and must, therefore, be strictly and responsibly sited, managed and
        closed. Tailings can, for example, be dispersed by many processes (such as
        sinkholes, earthquakes, intense rainfall and flood events, and wind), substandard
        design and construction, and seepage. The stability and behaviour of TSFs
        needs to be continuously monitored and one highly effective way of doing this
        is through satellite Earth observation (EO). \nThe EO industry is witnessing
        a technological revolution. Large and long-lifespan satellite sensors that
        have been the staple of national space agencies and commercial satellite manufacturers
        are now being complemented by constellations of low-cost, short-lifespan \u2018cube
        sats\u2019 by companies with the ambition to image the whole earth daily.
        Satellites with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are also collecting
        high volumes of data, with the added benefit of being able to do so day or
        night and in different weather conditions. The range of data options and capabilities
        these provide open opportunities for novel data analysis techniques for TSFs.
        One of these is satellite InSAR (interferometric SAR; a technique used to
        map millimetric-precision changes in ground height over time), which is already
        used by mining companies to reduce risk in and of their operations. From monitoring
        the stability of TSFs, through to assessments of impacts of natural hazards,
        InSAR allows rapid and accurate targeting of high-risk areas and structures
        to identify those that require subsequent investigation through ground-based
        methods. \nTo demonstrate the application of EO data and InSAR in identifying
        pre- and post-failure mine activities and TSF deformation, the authors will
        present a case study across Cadia mine, New South Wales, Australia, which
        had a localised TSF failure on 9 March 2018. The InSAR results presented show
        that low-magnitude subsidence signals were observed across the TSF dam during
        the year preceding the collapse. In January 2018 a notable change in behaviour
        was observed, with a concentrated area of subsidence focused on the region
        which initially failed on 9 March 2018. Furthermore, post-collapse InSAR measurements
        show an increased rate of subsidence for regions either side of the failure
        zone. Review of medium- and high-resolution satellite images show that the
        failure was phased, with an initial failure and then a subsequent failure
        at least two days after 9 March 2018. It also highlights what might be construction
        activity associated with a dam raise prior to failure.", "venue": "Proceedings

        Storage (CCS) in Victoria", "abstract": "At present, 85% of the electricity
        in the state of Victoria, southeast Australia, is generated from power stations
        fuelled by the extensive brown coal resources of the Latrobe Valley (DPI 2008).
        These resources are crucially important to the future economic development
        of Victoria and the Victorian Government is committed to developing these
        resources in an environmentally responsible manner. One possible method for
        reducing large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) greenhouse gas emissions (that
        result from the combustion of brown coal) is through carbon capture and storage
        (CCS). As a result, the Victorian Department of Primary Industries commissioned
        the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) to
        undertake a review to determine the potential for geological storage opportunities
        for CCS within Victoria and its adjacent waters (Gibson-Poole et al. 2006).
        The study assessed the geology of known sedimentary basins in Victoria and
        reviewed the results against existing criteria for evaluation of CO2 geological
        storage potential, using public domain data sources. This paper summarises
        that work and provides a technical overview that documents the basin-scale
        suitability of Victoria for CCS, and identifi es and prioritises potential
        Victorian CO2 geological storage opportunities, in both onshore and offshore
        geological settings.", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 42, "citationCount":

        Mathiatis massive sulphide mine, Cyprus", "abstract": "Abstract The Mathiatis
        massive sulphide deposit in Cyprus was a low-grade (0.3% Cu), three million
        ton ore body of pyrite and minor chalcopyrite occurring within basaltic lavas
        of the Troodos ophiolite. Cessation of mining in 1987 left a deep open pit
        surrounded by large heaps of spoil, which are undergoing oxidation and leaching.
        The aim of this study was to determine the mineralogical controls on the storage
        and potential remobilization of As, Cu, Pb and Zn within, and from, mine spoil
        heaps. Most of the spoil samples collected, and related materials (stream
        sediment, reaction zone between a boulder of massive pyrite and calcareous
        chert, salt crusts on stream beds), are enriched in As (27-220 ppm), Cu (110-400
        ppm), Pb (10-140 ppm) and Zn (290 - 12,000 ppm) relative to both the basalt
        and calcareous chert (As 4-10 ppm, Cu 20-76 ppm, Pb 3-6 ppm, Zn 39-200 ppm).
        Arsenic, Cu, Pb and Zn in the spoil and related materials are associated with
        Fe(-Al-S)-O, Fe(-Al-Mg)-S-O, Al(-Mg-Fe)-S-O and Mg(-Al-Fe)-S-O phases (the
        brackets represent minor components of less than 20 wt.% within the phases).
        Chemical extraction work using CaCl2 suggests that Cu, Zn and to some extent,
        As, are potentially more soluble than Pb. This is corroborated by the very
        high total concentrations of Cu and Zn in both the secondary salt crusts and
        the reaction zone material, high CaCl2-extractable As, Cu and Zn in the salt
        crusts, and aqueous data for the Mathiatis mine area collected for a European
        Union LIFE report. This may have implications for ecosystem health and water
        quality in the Mathiatis area and areas of similar mineralogy and climate

        "title": "A review of the petrology of harzburgites at Hess Deep and Garrett
        Deep: implications for mantle processes beneath segments of the East Pacific
        Rise", "abstract": "Abstract In recent years a unique set of samples of uppermost
        mantle at the mantle-crust transition zone have been collected from two different
        environments along the fast-spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR): a \u2018normal\u2019
        spreading segment (represented by samples from Hess Deep) and the end of a
        spreading segment where the EPR meets the Garrett transform fault (represented
        by samples from Garrett Deep). A review of the petrology of harzburgites from
        the two sites demonstrates that these rocks were produced by partial melting
        of adiabatically upwelling mantle and, subsequently, at the top of the mantle,
        they were impregnated by reactive and crystallizing mid-ocean ridge basaltic
        (MORB) melts. Despite this similar history, non-impregnated harzburgites at
        Garrett Deep have a more fertile spinel chemistry than those at Hess Deep,
        which is consistent with reduced partial melting of shallow mantle as a transform
        fault is approached \u2014 the \u2018transform fault effect\u2019. The extent
        of reaction between melt and harzburgite during the impregnation event suggests
        that melt arrived in the uppermost mantle in a highly reactive state because
        along the adiabatic path it had been highly channelled in spatially restricted
        conduits. This implies that mantle upwelling below the EPR was, and presumably
        still is, dominantly two dimensional (sheet-like). Within this framework,
        the chemical evolution of MORB melt below fast-spreading ridges will be significantly
        affected by melt-periodotite reaction only when melt reaches the uppermost
        mantle and mantle-crust transition zone, where along-axis transport of melt
        may also be important. Although the harzburgites from Hess Deep and Garrett
        Deep formed and evolved beneath different parts of different first-order segments
        of the EPR, the petrology of these rocks presents the best analogue available
        for defining real variations in mantle processes along a single first-order
        ridge segment in a fast-spreading environment.", "venue": "Geological Society

        Rise: evidence from ODP Site 895 (Hess Deep)", "abstract": "Abstract Ocean
        Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 147 recently drilled at Site 895 in Hess Deep (eastern
        Equatorial Pacific), where a structurally dissected section of the East Pacific
        Rise (EPR) is preserved, and intersected the mantlecrust transition zone of
        a fast-spreading centre for the first time. The core from Hole 895D (latitude
        2\u00b016.645\u02b9N longitude 101\u00b026.777\u02b9W)revealed that harzburgite
        is predominant over dunite in the top section of the Hole, but the reverse
        relationship is found lower in the section where dunite is closely associated
        with gabbroic rocks (gabbro and troctolite). Texture, mineralogy and mineral
        chemistry suggest a two-stage evolution for harzburgite preserved at the transition
        zone. Harzburgite with a porphyroclastic texture was produced by partial melting
        of peridotite to, or beyond the clinopyroxene-out phase boundary before or
        during asthenospheric (>1000\u00b0C flow, which suggests a higher degree of
        mantle melting than normally expected below mid-ocean ridges. Subsequently,
        basaltic melt(s) interacted with this refractory harzburgite (olivine + orthopyroxene
        + spinel), which resulted in dissolution of orthopyroxene, re-equilibration
        and formation of olivine and spinel, and formation of clinopyroxene \u00b1
        plagioclase, this is manifested as a progressive conversion of harzburgite
        to gabbroic rock through an intermediate dunite. At low melt/peridotite ratios,
        harzburgite was refertilised as the plagioclase component of the melt completely
        reacted with the peridotite matrix to produce clinopyroxene-spinel intergrowths
        and Al enrichment in ferromagnesian minerals. At high ratios, orthopyroxene
        completely dissolved incongruently, plagioclase appeared, and spinel was partially
        to completely resorbed; this produced olivine-bearing and olivine-free gabbroic
        rocks. Residual minerals in peridotites adjacent to gabbroic zones were enriched
        in Fe and Ti and depleted in Al.", "venue": "Mineralogical magazine", "year":

        enables these elements to provide important information on the history of
        ophiolite mantle. ln the Springers Hill area, Lewis Hills Massif, Bay of Islands
        Ophiolite Complex, Newfoundland, a residuum of harz-burgite and minor dunite
        is intruded successively by a suite of dunite t chromite, orthop,''roxenite
        and clinoplroxenite veins and dykes. These intrusive bodies represent crystal
        fraclionates rather than liquid compositions. The fractionation sequence is
        typical of refractory melts such as boninites. Platinum-group minerals (PGM)
        and chondrite-normalized PG.E pattems show that as the melt evolves, solid
        grains of Os-bearing laurite become entrapped in chro-mite, whereas solid
        Pt-Pd arsenide phases are incorporated in pyroxene. Consequently, the Pdllr
        value of the melt increases with progressive crystal fractionation, as the
        immiscible liquid phase changes from S-saturated to As-satuated. Harzburgites
        of residual origin have Pd/Ir << l. The Springers Hill harzburgites are PGE-enriched
        (Pd/Ir = 1.2-1,7), but otherwise possess residual characteristics arising
        from a minimum of lTVo partial melting. Partial melting would have partitioned
        all sulfide in the source into the melt. Melt extraction was highly efficient,
        and no sulfide or silicate melt remained in the Springers Hill harz-burgites.
        Therefore, PGE in the Springers Hill harzburgites are not present in sulfides.
        Field and petrographic evidence shows that enrichment of the PGE in Springers
        Hill harz-burgites resulted from addition ofan early-suite ofihopyrox-enite
        component (average Pd/Ir = 51). Orthopyroxene addition occurred by melt impregnation

        of Moments are also implemented into the Intermediate Level Circuit Model.
        These Uncertainty Analysis methods are applied to a number of specific examples,
        from simple examples that have analytic solutions, to more realistic and complex
        Electromagnetic Compatibility scenarios. Performing both Error and Uncertainty
        Analyses enables an investigation on the relationship between the errors and
        uncertainties, in the output of simulations, to be conducted. Different Computational
        Electromagnetic methods are also used in this thesis to determine the differences
        in the uncertainty in the output of simulations performed using the different
        methods. In Electromagnetic Compatibility the output of interest is often
        a curve viewed in the frequency domain. The Feature Selective Validation method
        is used in this thesis to compare the mean, uncertainty and ninety five percent
        confidence interval curves formed from the different Uncertainty Analysis
        methods. Curve Alignment techniques are also used to determine the extent
        to which the errors and uncertainties in the output curves are amplitude and
        frequency errors and uncertainties. The results obtained in this thesis show
        that, of the three uncertainty analysis meth-", "venue": "", "year": 2009,

        "title": "Energy distributions of protons in DCX", "abstract": "A particle
        spectrometer has been used to measure the energy distributions of neutral
        hydrogen atoms escaping from the 300 keV proton storage ring in DCX as the
        result of electron capture collisions between trapped protons and background
        gas molecules. A portion of the atoms were converted to protons by passage
        through an argon-filled gas cell, and the proton beam was then electrostatically
        analyzed. Energy distributions of the circulating protons were obtained by
        transformations applied to the measured distributions. For both gas and carbon
        arc dissociation the energy distributions were strong functions of the injected
        H2+ current and the location of the region of sampling relative to the median
        plane. A number of curves are shown illustrating these dependences. With arc
        dissociation, the circulating protons lost energy at a rate of about 20 keV/ms
        with 0.1 mA injected current, and at a rate twice this value when the current
        was increased to 2.3 mA. Most of the 20 keV/ms loss rate is believed to be
        due to coulomb collisions of the circulating protons with electrons in the
        dissociating arc. This loss rate is within a factor of two of that calculated
        on the basis of loss to electrons of a Maxwellian distribution, well within
        the accuracy of the arc parameters used in the calculation. Several mechanisms
        that might account for the additional energy loss rate at higher currents
        are suggested, but details of the origin of this loss are as yet unclear.
        The additional energy loss had the consequence of decreasing the mean storage
        time of the circulating protons. Measurements with gas dissociation also showed
        an increase in the rate of energy loss with injected current. With either
        arc or gas dissociation, the response of the energy distributions to changes
        in injected H2+ current indicated the presence of a non-collisional dispersing
        mechanism which increases in importance with increases in injected current.
        The nature of this mechanism is not clear.", "venue": "", "year": 1961, "referenceCount":

        U.S. Food and Drig Administration\u2013approved drug with anti-inflammatory
        actions. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of
        C1-INH on acute and chronic neurobehavioral outcomes and on seizures in the
        chronic stage in a mouse traumatic brain injury (TBI) model. Adult male CD1
        mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact and randomly allocated to
        receive C1-INH or vehicle solution 1\u2009h post-TBI. Effects of C1-INH treatment
        on inflammatory responses and brain damage after TBI were examined using the
        Cytometric Bead Array, C5a enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, Fluoro-Jade
        C staining, and Nissl staining. Neurobehavioral outcomes after TBI were assessed
        with modified neurological severity scores, the rotarod and open field tests,
        and the active place avoidance task. Video-electroencephalographic monitoring
        was performed in the 15th and 16th weeks after TBI to document epileptic seizures.
        We found that C1-INH treatment reduced TNF\u03b1 expression and alleviated
        brain damage. Treatment with C1-INH improved neurological functions, increased
        locomotor activity, alleviated anxiety-like behavior, and exhibited an effect
        on seizures in the chronic stage after TBI. These findings suggest that C1-INH
        has beneficial effects on the treatment of TBI.", "venue": "Neurotrauma Reports",

        hyperalgesia and hindpaw inflammation were assessed by measuring paw pressure

        oxycodone exposure was assessed over an 8-h postdosing interval following
        topical application. Skin permeation of oxycodone from the gel formulation
        was assessed in vitro using Franz diffusion cells. Oxycodone administered
        topically or by i.pl. injection produced significant (p < 0.05) analgesia

        Herein we assessed comparative temporal changes in spatial memory function
        in two commercially available transgenic mouse models of AD using the Morris
        water maze (MWM), incorporating both visible and hidden platform training.
        Individual cohorts of cDNA\u2010based \u2018line 85\u2019\u2010derived double\u2010transgenic

        R) for the relief of neuropathic pain. Design and Methods. Adult male Sprague-Dawley
        (SD) rats received single intravenous (1\u201310 mg/kg) or oral (5\u201310
        mg/kg) bolus doses of EMA200, EMA300, EMA400 or EMA401 ( S -enantiomer of
        EMA400). Blood samples were collected immediately pre-dose and at speci\ufb01ed
        times over a 12- to 24-hour post-dosing period. Liquid chromatography tandem
        mass spectrometry was used to measure plasma drug concentrations. Efficacy
        was assessed in adult male SD rats with a unilateral chronic constriction
        injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Results. After intravenous administration
        in rats, mean ( (cid:2) standard error of the mean) plasma clearance for EMA200,
        EMA300, EMA400, and EMA401 was 9.3, 6.1, 0.7, and 1.1 L/hour/kg, respectively.
        After oral dosing, the dose-normalized systemic exposures of EMA400 and EMA401
        were 20- to 30-fold and 50- to 60-fold higher than that for EMA300 and EMA200,
        respectively. The oral bioavailability of EMA400 and EMA401 was similar at
        ~ 30%, whereas it was only 5.9% and 7.1% for EMA200 and EMA300, respectively.
        In CCI rats, single intraperitoneal bolus doses of EMA200, EMA300, and EMA400
        evoked dose-dependent pain relief. The pain relief potency rank order in CCI
        rats was EMA400 > EMA300 > EMA200 in agreement with the dose-normalized systemic
        exposure rank order in SD rats. Conclusion. The small molecule AT 2 R antagonist,

        as novel analgesics for neuropathic pain: comparative pharmacokinetics, radioligand
        binding, and efficacy in rats.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nNeuropathic pain
        is an area of unmet clinical need. The objective of this study was to define
        the pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and efficacy in rats of small
        molecule antagonists of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT\u2082R) for
        the relief of neuropathic pain.\n\n\nDESIGN AND METHODS\nAdult male Sprague-Dawley
        (SD) rats received single intravenous (1-10\u2009mg/kg) or oral (5-10\u2009mg/kg)
        bolus doses of EMA200, EMA300, EMA400 or EMA401 (S-enantiomer of EMA400).
        Blood samples were collected immediately pre-dose and at specified times over
        a 12- to 24-hour post-dosing period. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
        was used to measure plasma drug concentrations. Efficacy was assessed in adult
        male SD rats with a unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic
        nerve.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAfter intravenous administration in rats, mean (\u00b1standard
        error of the mean) plasma clearance for EMA200, EMA300, EMA400, and EMA401
        was 9.3, 6.1, 0.7, and 1.1\u2009L/hour/kg, respectively. After oral dosing,
        the dose-normalized systemic exposures of EMA400 and EMA401 were 20- to 30-fold
        and 50- to 60-fold higher than that for EMA300 and EMA200, respectively. The
        oral bioavailability of EMA400 and EMA401 was similar at \u223c30%, whereas
        it was only 5.9% and 7.1% for EMA200 and EMA300, respectively. In CCI rats,
        single intraperitoneal bolus doses of EMA200, EMA300, and EMA400 evoked dose-dependent
        pain relief. The pain relief potency rank order in CCI rats was EMA400\u2009>\u2009EMA300\u2009>\u2009EMA200
        in agreement with the dose-normalized systemic exposure rank order in SD rats.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe
        small molecule AT\u2082R antagonist, EMA401, is in clinical development as
        a novel analgesic for the relief of neuropathic pain.", "venue": "Pain medicine

        "abstract": "1 Antinociception versus serum morphine concentration relationships
        were defined in male and female Sprague\u2010Dawley rats administered single
        intravenous (i.v.) bolus doses of morphine, using the hot plate (2.1\u201314
        mg/kg) and tail flick tests (1\u20138 mg/kg). 2 Serum concentrations of morphine
        and morphine\u20103\u2010glucuronide (M3G), its major metabolite in the rat,
        were assayed using high\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with
        electrochemical detection. 3 Significantly higher (P < 0.05) values of peak
        antinociception (approximately 1.7\u2010fold), as well as the extent and duration
        of antinociception (approximately fourfold), were observed in male compared
        with female rats administered 10 mg/kg morphine in the hot plate test. Although
        there were no significant sex\u2010related differences in the area under the
        serum morphine concentration versus time curve (AUC) at this dose, systemic
        exposure to M3G (M3G AUC) was significantly higher (approximately twofold;
        P < 0.05) in female than male rats. 4 In contrast with most previous studies
        investigating sex differences in morphine antinociception in rats, the antinociceptive
        effects of single i.v. doses of morphine (1\u20138 mg/kg) in the tail flick
        test did not differ significantly between male and female rats. 5 Morphine
        ED50 and EC50 values (95% confidence intervals) for antinociception in the
        hot plate test were significantly lower (P < 0.05) in male rats (ED50 8.4
        mg/kg (7.6\u20139.2); EC50 1.8 nmol/L (1.5\u20132.1)) compared with female
        rats (ED50 10.6 mg/kg (9.1\u201312.0); EC50 3.7 nmol/L (3.4\u20134.1)). However,
        in the tail flick test, there was no significant difference between male and
        female rats in ED50 (1.8 (0.4\u20133.3) and 1.4 mg/kg (0.4\u20132.5), respectively)
        or EC50 (0.5 (0.3\u20130.6) and 0.4 nmol/L (0.2\u20130.5), respectively) values.

        "1 The pharmacokinetics and oxidative metabolism of oxycodone were investigated
        following intravenous and oral administration in male and female Sprague\u2010Dawley
        (SD) rats. 2 High\u2010performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)\u2013electrospray
        ionization (ESI)\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (MS\u2010MS) was used to quantify
        plasma concentrations of oxycodone and its oxidative metabolites noroxycodone
        and oxymorphone following administration of single bolus intravenous (5 mg/kg)
        and oral (10 mg/kg) doses of oxycodone. 3 The mean (\u00b1SEM) clearance of
        intravenous oxycodone was significantly higher in male than female SD rats
        (4.9 \u00b1 0.3 vs 3.1 \u00b1 0.3 L/h per kg, respectively; P < 0.01). Mean
        areas under the plasma concentration versus time curves (AUC) for oxycodone
        were significantly higher in female than male SD rats following intravenous
        (~1.6\u2010fold; P < 0.01) and oral (~sevenfold; P < 0.005) administration.
        4 The oral bioavailability of oxycodone was low (at 1.2 and 5.0%, respectively)
        in male and female SD rats, a finding consistent with high first\u2010pass
        metabolism. Noroxycodone : oxycodone AUC ratios were significantly higher
        in male than female SD rats after intravenous (~2.4\u2010fold; P < 0.005)
        and oral (~12\u2010fold; P < 0.005) administration. 5 Circulating oxymorphone
        concentrations remained very low following both routes of administration.
        Noroxycodone : oxymorphone AUC ratios were greater in male than female SD
        rats after intravenous (~13\u2010 and fivefold, respectively) and oral (~90\u2010
        and sixfold, respectively) administration. 6 Sex differences were apparent
        in the pharmacokinetics, oxidative metabolism and oral bioavailability of
        oxycodone. Systemic exposure to oxycodone was greater in female compared with
        male SD rats, whereas systemic exposure to metabolically derived noroxycodone
        was higher in male than female SD rats. 7 Oral administration of oxycodone

        "title": "STUDIES WITH KETAMINE AND ALFENTANIL FOLLOWING FREUND''S COMPLETE
        ADJUVANT\u2010INDUCED INFLAMMATION IN RATS", "abstract": "1 N\u2010Methyl\u2010d\u2010aspartate
        (NMDA) receptor antagonists suppress inflammatory hyperalgesia and the development
        of acute opioid tolerance. They may also enhance opioid\u2010induced antinociception,
        while suppressing postopioid\u2010induced hyperalgesia and opioid\u2010enhanced
        inflammatory hyperalgesia. 2 The non\u2010competitive NMDA receptor antagonist,
        ketamine, is a racemic chiral drug; its individual enantiomers have differing
        affinities for the NMDA receptor. The anaesthetic and antinociceptive potencies
        of (S)\u2010ketamine are 1.5\u2010 and threefold higher, respectively, than
        those of (R)\u2010ketamine in laboratory rodents. 3 The present study investigated
        the effects of racemic ketamine and enantiopure (S)\u2010ketamine on inflammatory
        hyperalgesia in rats, 5 days after intraplantar injection of Freund''s complete
        adjuvant (FCA) into one hind paw. First, racemic or (S)\u2010ketamine was
        administered alone; second, racemic or (S)\u2010ketamine was administered
        30 min after initiation of i.v. infusions of the \u00b5\u2010opioid agonist,
        alfentanil. 4 Area under the curve (AUC) values for Von Frey paw withdrawal
        threshold (PWT) versus time curves were significantly increased (P < 0.05)
        for both inflamed and non\u2010inflamed hind paws by racemic and (S)\u2010ketamine
        (5 & 10 mg/kg, s.c.). Similarly, AUC values for reduction of hind paw volume
        versus time were significantly increased (P < 0.05) by racemic and (S)\u2010ketamine
        (10 mg/kg, s.c.). 5 Alfentanil infusions significantly increased PWT in both
        hind paws, but neither racemic nor (S)\u2010ketamine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) administered
        30 min after initiation of alfentanil infusion produced further increases
        in PWT. 6 Racemic and (S)\u2010ketamine produced antinociceptive effects in
        both hind paws, but an antihyperalgesic effect per se was not apparent. Additionally,
        there was a possible anti\u2010inflammatory effect of both drugs in the inflamed
        hind paw. These findings complement previous studies in which non\u2010competitive
        NMDA receptor antagonists suppressed behavioural hyperalgesia. 7 However,
        racemic and (S)\u2010ketamine did not further enhance alfentanil''s antinociceptive
        effects, although they appeared to prolong alfentanil''s antinociceptive effects
        in the non\u2010inflamed hind paw. These findings suggest that factors such
        as time\u2010course, frequency and the mode of administration of NMDA receptor
        antagonists, in addition to the type of antinociceptive model (i.e. inflammatory
        compared with acute) and the nociceptive testing procedure (i.e. noxious mechanical
        compared with low threshold stimuli) may influence their effects on opioid\u2010induced
        antinociception.", "venue": "Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology",

        Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may produce anti-hyperalgesic
        effects by altering tryptophan metabolism to increase kynurenate concentrations.
        We examined whether the NSAID diclofenac (40 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline (control)
        increased kynurenine and kynurenate accumulation in tissues following pretreatment
        with tryptophan (200 mg/kg, i.p., 150 min before tissue harvesting). Significantly
        larger increases in kynurenine and kynurenate concentrations occurred when
        diclofenac followed tryptophan pretreatment (maximal, 60 min: plasma: by 58%
        and 49%; kidney: by 205% and 203%) when compared to control. Brain and spinal
        cord kynurenine concentrations increased maximally (120 min: by 39% and 95%)
        when diclofenac challenge followed tryptophan pretreatment. In brain, diclofenac
        increased kynurenate concentrations (20 min: by 274%). Diclofenac facilitated
        kynurenine and kynurenate accumulation in plasma and kidney, apparently by
        inhibiting renal elimination. This raises the possibility that (some) NSAIDs

        has been suggested for total i.v. anaesthesia. We determined the pharmacokinetics
        of ketamine and alfentanil, alone and together, in three groups of adult male
        rats, to assess any pharmacokinetic interaction.\n\n\nMETHODS\nGroup 1 animals
        were infused with i.v. ketamine for 5 min; in group 2, constant low plasma
        concentrations of alfentanil were maintained by computer-controlled infusion;
        in group 3, the treatments were combined. Serial plasma and terminal tissue
        concentrations were measured by high performance liquid chromatography or
        gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn the presence of alfentanil,
        the mean plasma ketamine concentration-time area under the curve (AUC) value
        was significantly lower (by 13%, P<0.05), while clearance (CIT) and volume
        of distribution (Vss) were significantly higher (by 16 and 28%, respectively,
        both P<0.05). Tissue:plasma distribution coefficients for ketamine in the
        presence of alfentanil were significantly higher in forebrain (by 128%, P<0.005),
        hindbrain (by 207%, P<0.01), gut (by 254%, P<0.005), and fat (by 344%, P<0.0001).
        Mean AUC values for alfentanil did not differ significantly in the presence
        of ketamine, but alfentanil tissue concentrations were significantly lower
        in forebrain (by 77%, P<0.0001), hindbrain (by 28%, P<0.01), heart (by 33%,
        P<0.01), lung (30%, P<0.05), and gut (by 21%, P<0.05). Corresponding tissue:plasma
        distribution coefficients were significantly lower for forebrain (by 69%,
        P<0.0001) alone.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe finding that the distribution of ketamine
        into the brain was increased by low plasma concentrations of alfentanil could
        have important clinical applications for pain management.", "venue": "British

        is a racemate. In this study, we examined whether thiopental total body clearance
        and its distribution into central nervous system (CNS) tissue of rats was
        enantioselective. Rats, either anesthetized with halothane or conscious and
        restrained, were infused to stepwise steady-state targets of 5, 10, and 20
        microg/mL thiopental by computer-controlled infusions. Serial arterial plasma
        and steady-state samples of brain and spinal cord were assayed enantiospecifically
        for thiopental. In both groups, concurrent total and unbound plasma concentrations
        of S-thiopental were approximately 10%-20% higher than those of R-thiopental,
        corresponding to its higher clearance. CNS tissue concentrations of S-thiopental
        were approximately 20% higher than those of R-thiopental. Spinal cord to plasma
        distribution coefficients were approximately 2 x those in the brain, with
        relative distribution coefficients approximately 10% greater for R-thiopental
        in both tissues. Plasma concentrations and distribution coefficients of both
        enantiomers were approximately 10%-20% lower in the halothane-anesthetized
        group, with a slightly greater effect on R-thiopental distribution. We conclude
        that the total body clearance of R-thiopental > S-thiopental, that halothane
        enantioselectively reduces the relative uptake of R-thiopental into brain
        tissue, and that composition is important in determining the CNS tissue concentrations
        of thiopental. The reported higher potency of S-thiopental did not seem to
        be due to its greater distribution into CNS tissues.\n\n\nIMPLICATIONS\nBecause
        thiopental is a mixture of two forms (termed R-and S-enantiomers), correct
        interpretation of its distribution into, and clearance from, the body requires
        knowledge about both enantiomers. In this study, performed in rats, we showed
        that the two enantiomers of thiopental differed significantly, with the R-enantiomer
        having the preferred profile.", "venue": "Anesthesia and Analgesia", "year":

        agonist clonidine causes marked hyperglycemia in the rat. It is not clear
        whether this effect is mediated within the brain at either pre- or postsynaptic
        alpha 2-adrenoceptors or whether it is due to peripheral alpha 2-agonist actions.
        We employed computerized mass spectrometry to measure noradrenaline (NA) and
        its primary neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG) in the medial
        basal hypothalamus of rats treated acutely with clonidine, the alpha 2-antagonist
        yohimbine, the postganglionic noradrenergic blocker guanethidine and the neuroglycopenic
        agent 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). That clonidine''s hyperglycemic effect was
        due, in part, to an action at central alpha 2-adrenoceptors was indicated
        by the ability of guanethidine to significantly inhibit the glucose response.
        Because of clonidine''s inhibition of hypothalamic NA release (assessed by
        the DHPG/NA ratio), presumably by presynaptic agonism, these data indicated
        that postsynaptic receptor stimulation by clonidine was involved in activating
        glucose release. Yohimbine markedly increased the hypothalamic DHPG/NA ratio,
        reflecting presynaptic stimulation of NA release, but at the same time inhibited
        the hyperglycemic response due to 2-DG administration. This latter effect
        to block hyperglycemia is consistent with antagonism of postsynaptic alpha
        2-adrenoceptors involved in mediating hepatic glucose output. These data indicate

        stimulation produced by (+)-amphetamine in naive and dopamine-depleted mice.",
        "abstract": "The interaction between (+)-amphetamine and dopamine (DA) D1
        and D2 receptors was investigated. In na\u00efve mice, i.e., mice with intact
        stores of DA, both the selective D1 antagonist SCH23390 and the selective
        D2 antagonist spiperone blocked the locomoter stimulation produced by (+)-amphetamine.
        The selective D1 agonist SKF38393 (6 mg/kg intraperitoneally) did not produce
        a consistent dose-dependent effect on the response to (+)-amphetamine in na\u00efve
        mice. In mice depleted of DA with reserpine 24 hr before a challenge with
        (+)-amphetamine, neither SCH23390 nor spiperone were completely effective
        in blocking (+)-amphetamine. A combination of spiperone plus SCH23390 was,
        however, more effective than either drug alone, although significant activity
        remained even after the combination. In mice pretreated with reserpine and
        various doses of alpha methyl-p-tyrosine (alpha MPT, intraperitoneally), the
        degree of stimulation produced by (+)-amphetamine was dependent on the amount
        and frequency of alpha MPT dosage - the higher and more frequent the dose,
        the more effective the blockade. In these animals, both SKF38393 and the selective
        D2 agonist quinpirole potentiated the stimulation induced by (+)-amphetamine
        when the dose of alpha MPT was not maximal. However, in those animals pretreated
        with reserpine plus two doses each of 400 mg/kg alpha MPT, neither SKF38393
        nor quinpirole were effective in potentiating (+)-amphetamine. Nevertheless,
        when SKF38393 and quinpirole were administered simultaneously to these mice,
        marked locomotor stimulation occurred implying that the pretreatment itself
        had not rendered the mice incapable of locomotion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250

        performance that improved film quality can have an adverse effect on the I/sub

        systems and thin systems having pyramidal symmetry (i.e., tents and shells).
        Both stationary and rotating systems containing any number of particles arranged
        with the symmetry of a regular polygon or polygonal pyramid are considered.
        For macroscopic systems, unlike molecules, different possible constraints
        must be taken into account in enumerating the genuine vibrations of various
        types. Otherwise, one proceeds as in the molecular case. By going to the limit
        of large numbers of particles, one obtains the fractional occurrence numbers

        its 3-methyl derivative in xeroderma pigmentosum fibroblasts belonging to
        different complementation groups: evidence for different epistasis groups
        involved in the repair of large adducts in human DNA.", "abstract": "The data
        in this paper show that when the inhibition of growth is measured, xeroderma
        pigmentosum (XP) complementation groups A, G and D are very sensitive to 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide
        (4NQO), whereas only XP groups G and D are very sensitive to 3-methyl-4NQO
        (3me4NQO). Cells belonging to XP-C group are not particularly sensitive to
        either agent. Thus there are different epistasis groups for the excision repair
        of DNA adducts induced by these agents as opposed to the repair of u.v. damage.
        DNA polymerase alpha is involved in the repair of 4NQO-induced lesions because
        aphidicolin blocks their repair. XP cells from all the above groups are defective
        to some extent in this repair. The degree of repair defectiveness follows
        that seen after u.v., with even the XP-C cell line used having reduced repair
        (despite the fact that the inhibition of growth by 4NQO in this cell line
        was not markedly different from normal). Aphidicolin did not induce breaks
        in the normal or XP cell lines exposed to 3me4NQO, thus the repair of lesions
        induced by 3me4NQO does not involve DNA polymerase alpha in any of the cell
        lines. Finally, catalase reduces the alkaline labile lesions induced by 4NQO,
        but not 3me4NQO, suggesting the latter agent does not induce substantial amounts
        of DNA damage by the generation of radicals.", "venue": "Carcinogenesis",

        and 1-aminopyrene were investigated for their ability to induce covalently
        bound DNA adducts in calf thymus DNA and Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts.
        Xanthine oxidase catalysed the induction of one major and one minor DNA adduct
        in 1-nitropyrene- or 1-nitrosopyrene-treated calf thymus DNA, whilst 1-aminopyrene
        was inactive. These compounds did not form detectable DNA adducts in the absence
        of xanthine oxidase. The major DNA adduct produced by 1-nitropyrene and 1-nitrosopyrene
        in calf thymus DNA co-migrated on h.p.l.c., and the structure was consistent
        with that previously described by others as N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-1-aminopyrene.
        The compounds were investigated for their ability to form DNA adducts in Chinese
        hamster lung fibroblasts. 1-Nitropyrene (5.2 pmol/mg DNA/h) and 1-nitrosopyrene
        (129 pmol/mg DNA/h) formed a single DNA adduct in Chinese hamster lung cells
        which co-eluted on h.p.l.c. with the C-8 deoxyguanosine adduct isolated from
        1-nitropyrene-treated calf thymus DNA. 1-Nitrosopyrene was the most efficient
        compound investigated for the production of the C-8 guanine adducts. In contrast,
        1-aminopyrene (14.7 pmol/mg DNA/h) induced the formation of a DNA adduct which
        did not co-elute with the C-8 guanine adduct. The data presented here suggest
        that 1-nitropyrene and 1-aminopyrene are metabolized to reactive intermediates
        which form different DNA adducts in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts.", "venue":

        tels qu''un noyau adhesif ou preforme, ainsi que des produits/articles associes.
        Le procede et l''appareil selon l''invention utilisent le montant ou l''element
        de base des sous-ensembles velours allonges (des cordons de touffes ou des
        cordons de touffes enracinees par exemple) pour former une \u00e2me tubulaire

        tels que des rouleaux-brosses, des panneaux interieurs destines a divers modes
        de transport ou un article de revetement de sol. Le flux fondu du montant,
        adjacent a un autre, le long d''une surface de mandrin (104), forme un materiau
        de base continu. Dans le cas d''un rouleau-brosse, ce materiau de base forme
        une \u00e2me a partir de laquelle le velours de rouleaux-brosses s''etend
        radialement. Ce procede de fabrication de brosses ou d''autres articles analogues
        permet d''eliminer la necessite d''adhesifs pour les \u00e2mes et de materiaux
        de support en tissu normalement necessaires au fil du velours. Un mandrin
        supplementaire peut egalement etre utilise pour obtenir differentes formes

        "This paper explores Fano resonances due to non-adiabatic coupling of vibrational
        modes and the electron continuum in dipole-bound anions. We adopt a simple
        one-electron model consisting of a point dipole and an auxiliary potential
        to represent the electron interaction with the neutral core. Nuclear motion
        is added by assuming that harmonic vibrations modulate the dipole moment.
        When the model is parameterized to simulate key features of the water tetramer
        anion, the resultant photodetachment lineshape closely resembles that observed
        experimentally and analyzed as a Fano resonance with a parameter q close to
        -1. Other parameterizations are explored for the model and it is found that
        large changes in the auxiliary potential are required to change the sign of
        q. This is consistent with the experimental finding that q is negative for
        all water cluster sizes studied.", "venue": "Journal of Chemical Physics",

        We obtain for the cross-section an analytic expression containing the weak

        of the \u03b12A-Adrenergic Receptor*", "abstract": "Previous studies have
        shown that \u03b12A-adrenergic receptor (\u03b12A-AR) retention at the basolateral
        surface of polarized MDCKII cells involves its third intracellular (3i loop).
        The present studies examining mutant \u03b12A-ARs possessing short deletions
        of the 3i loop indicate that no single region can completely account for the
        accelerated surface turnover of the \u03943i\u03b12A-AR, suggesting that the
        entire 3i loop is involved in basolateral retention. Both wild-type and \u03943i
        loop \u03b12A-ARs are extracted from polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
        cells with 0.2% Triton X-100 and with a similar concentration/response profile,
        suggesting that Triton X-100-resistant interactions of the \u03b12A-AR with
        cytoskeletal proteins are not involved in receptor retention on the basolateral
        surface. The indistinguishable basolateral t 1 2 for either the wild-type
        or nonsense 3i loop \u03b12A-AR suggests that the stabilizing properties of
        the \u03b12A-AR 3i loop are not uniquely dependent on a specific sequence
        of amino acids. The accelerated turnover of \u03943i \u03b12A-AR cannot be
        attributed to alteration in agonist-elicited \u03b12A-AR redistribution, because
        \u03b12A-ARs are not down-regulated in response to agonist. Taken together,
        the present studies show that stabilization of the \u03b12A-AR on the basolateral
        surface of MDCKII cells involves multiple mechanisms, with the third intracellular
        loop playing a central role in regulating these processes.", "venue": "Journal

        to reject neither the heartbeat hypothesis nor the handedness hypothesis.
        Moreover, it is conceivable that both factors are operating to produce a left
        bias in child holding by women and no directional bias in child holding by
        men. In most societies, women tend to be responsible for the care of children,
        and at the same time they are expected to carry out other chores (Barry and
        Paxson 1971, Brown 1970, Munroe and Munroe 1975). Consequently, in view of
        the fact that most people are right-handed, most women would specialize their
        child holding on the left side in order to use the right hand for other tasks,
        e.g., cooking, feeding the infant, and gathering (Murdock and Provost 1973).
        Men, on the other hand, are less involved in caring for infants, and when
        they do hold children they are less likely to be involved simultaneously in
        other work. Consequently, men would not develop a significant tendency to
        hold children on the left or the right side. In American culture, and probably
        in many other cultures as well, there exists a bias in material culture favoring
        righthanders; objects (e.g., drinking fountains, scissors, automobiles, and
        typewriters) tend to be designed with right-handers in mind, and left-handers
        must adjust. Most schools stress righthanded writing, and, of course, handshaking
        must be done with the right hand in American and many other cultures. As a
        result of such influences, many individuals who are left-handed learn to behave
        like right-handers. They keep the right hand free for the performance of certain
        tasks. It should not be surprising, therefore, to find left-handed women carrying
        infants on the left side. If Salk''s heartbeat hypothesis is correct, then
        a naturalselection argument for both handedness and child-holding patterns
        can be proposed. Salk''s (1961) research indicates that infants exposed to
        a simulated heartbeat sound during the neonatal period gain more weight than
        do neonates not exposed to the heartbeat sound. Infant survival is positively
        associated with weight at birth (Williams, Spence, and Tideman 1977:8-9).
        For infants low in weight at birth, weight gain during the first few days
        of life ''may be crucial for survival. If exposure to maternal heartbeat sounds
        calms the infant, reduces crying, and leads to early weight gain, then women
        who hold their infants on the left should produce a greater number of surviving
        offspring than women who hold their infants on the right. Since handedness
        is apparently an inherited trait (Hicks and Kinsbourne 1976; Hulse 1971:214),
        and since right-handed women will be more likely to hold their infants on
        the left side, selection will favor right-handers. Left-handed women, of course,
        may \"learn\" that holding the infant on the left has a calming effect, and
        those who learn, the more perceptive mothers, may tend to hold infants on
        the left in spite of what may be a proclivity toward holding them on the right.
        Lefthanded women capable of perceiving the advantages of holding infants on
        the left would have a selective advantage over women who are left-handed but
        not as perceptive with respect to the needs of their infants. The Y?nomam6
        data support the hypothesis that there is a universal tendency for women to
        hold their infants on the left side. Additional research is needed to clarify
        the reasons behind this phenomenon.", "venue": "Current Anthropology", "year":

        \u201ceverything you wanted to know about children, for $2.7 billion\u201d
        (News Focus, 11 July, p. 162), Jocelyn Kaiser reports varying perspectives,
        negative as well as positive, on the planned National Children''s Study. As
        Kaiser notes, the National Children''s Study is an extremely ambitious project.
        It plans to follow 100,000 children in all areas of the United States from
        conception through the age of 21. Its goal is to comprehensively assess the
        impact of early exposures\u2014physical, chemical, biological, and social\u2014on
        growth, development, and life-long health. It offers an unparalleled opportunity
        to unravel the interplay of environmental and genetic factors in the causation
        of such conditions as asthma, childhood cancer, reproductive problems, and
        neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nAs longtime proponents of the study, we have
        heard the criticisms and the praise reported by Kaiser many times. And while
        we acknowledge that the plan for the study is very ambitious, we believe,
        frankly, that this bold reach will be the key to its success. A project of
        this scope requires the expertise of scientists from multiple disciplines
        and sectors, and the planning process is naturally unwieldy. But that is far
        preferable to a limited, narrow short-term study that can examine only one
        or a few factors at a time.\n\nWe believe that it would be incredibly shortsighted
        to put off this study because of its high cost. The study''s price tag is
        dwarfed in comparison to the cost of treating diseases and disabilities associated
        with low birth weight and preterm birth, asthma, diabetes, and obesity. This
        is why we have urged the President and Congress to make funding available.
        We anticipate that information from this study will help pediatricians treat
        childhood diseases and help guide child environmental health policy over the
        next generation. Costs need to be weighed in terms of value gained.", "venue":

        \u2014The North Carolina Pediatric Society has worked for years to improve

        inconsistent with our experience of the access problem for Medicaid children.
        For years we have felt that a majority of the primary care physicians restricted
        open access to children covered by Medicaid. Therefore, we were puzzled when
        the results of this survey indicated only 29% of pediatricians restricted
        access. If that were true, then there should be enough providers available

        "title": "A Novel Method and its Application to Define Maximum Horizontal
        Stress and Stress Path", "abstract": "\n Maximum horizontal stress (SH) and
        stress path (change of SH and minimum horizontal stress with depletion) are
        the two most difficult parameters to define for an oilfield geomechanical
        model. Understanding these in-situ stresses is critical to the success of
        operations and development, especially when production is underway, and the
        reservoir depletion begins. This paper introduces a method to define them
        through the analysis of actual minifrac data. Field examples of applications
        on minifrac failure analysis and operational pressure prediction are also
        presented.\n It is commonly accepted that one of the best methods to determine
        the minimum horizontal stress (Sh) is the use of pressure fall-off analysis
        of a minifrac test. Unlike Sh, the magnitude of SH cannot be measured directly.
        Instead it is back calculated by using fracture initiation pressure (FIP)
        and Sh derived from minifrac data. After non-depleted Sh and SH are defined,
        their apparent Poisson''s Ratios (APR) are calculated using the Eaton equation.
        These APRs define Sh and SH in virgin sand to encapsulate all other factors
        that influence in-situ stresses such as tectonic, thermal, osmotic and poro-elastic
        effects. These values can then be used to estimate stress path through interpretation
        of additional minifrac data derived from a depleted sand.\n A geomechanical
        model is developed based on APRs and stress paths to predict minifrac operation
        pressures. Three cases are included to show that the margin of error for FIP
        and fracture closure pressure (FCP) is less than 2%, fracture breakdown pressure
        (FBP) less than 4%. Two field cases in deep-water wells in the Gulf of Mexico
        show that the reduction of SH with depletion is lower than that for Sh.",

        a cricket ball", "abstract": "Swing, the sideways deviation of the cricket
        ball in flight, is a phenomenon which can be explained in terms of fluid dynamics.
        Conventional swing has been used since the beginning of the twentieth century
        and is effective with a new or well-preserved ball. A controversial form of
        swing emerged in Pakistan in the 1980s, featuring an older worn ball which,
        at a high speed, swung in the reverse direction. A cricket ball is asymmetric
        because of the presence of a seam, which is made up of rows of prominent encircling
        stitches. For conventional swing, this seam trips into turbulence the boundary
        layer adjacent to one hemisphere of the ball which remains attached to a greater
        angle (about 120\u00b0) than does that on the other side (about 80\u00b0)
        where no seam is present to trip the laminar boundary layer. The result is
        asymmetrical separation, leading to a skewed wake and a net pressure force
        on the ball perpendicular to the flight trajectory. Reverse swing is thought
        to be a consequence of the fact that asymmetry inverts at a high speed if
        the seam thickens the turbulent boundary layer on one side of the ball. Although
        the fluid dynamics causes of both conventional and reverse swing are well
        known, this paper demonstrates clearly, by means of flow visualization and
        pressure measurements, the inversion of this pressure asymmetry at Reynolds

        "The leak-off test (LOT) procedure has been examined within the theoretical
        framework pertaining to hydraulic fracturing stress measurements (HFSMs).
        LOT records have then been compared with the results of HFSMs where both measurements
        have been made in the same boreholes. From this comparison, we make recommendations
        on the use of LOT data, and suggest a new method of estimating the minimum
        horizontal stress magnitude (\u03c3 h ) from LOT pressure/volume plots In-situ
        stress magnitudes have been investigated by applying these methods to data
        from over 1000 LOTs in North Sea boreholes The results of this investigation
        imply that tectonic stress increases significantly with depth in some parts

        "title": "An assessment of fluid flow and overpressure modelling in selected
        North Sea and Laramide basins", "abstract": "The occurrence of overpressure
        observed in petroleum bearing basins must be understood in terms of generation
        and distribution in order to build up a fluid flow history. Overpressure influences
        expulsion and migration of hydrocarbons from source rocks. This thesis details
        and interprets observations and results of a case study into aspects of overpressure
        distribution, fluid flow patterns, causative mechanisms, palaeo- pressure
        and subsequent pressure history, the surface expression of overpressure and
        the mechanical strength relationships of sealing rocks. One of the principle
        study areas was the Alwyn field in the Northern North Sea. The overpressure
        distribution over the field area was seen not to be uniform. Organic geochemical
        data indicated that the source of reservoired hydrocarbons and associated
        fluids was the Viking Graben depocentre. Fluid inclusion data recorded in
        specific diagenetic mineral phases interpreted fluid flow conditions of hydrocarbons
        into the reservoir under normal pressures but elevated temperatures. When
        combined with computer generated pressure models, these diagenetic events
        were exclusive of modelled overpressure periods. The greatest contribution
        of overpressure was modelled as being a result of compaction disequilibrium
        but withalikely contribution from the thermal cracking of oil to gas which
        would also account for the present day distribution of overpressure across
        the Alwyn field area. The Uinta Basin with its relatively simple burial and
        thermal history allowed the production of a model . : involving a temporal
        history of overpressure generation, fracture development, regional tectonism,
        hydrocarbon maturation and expulsion and the process of Gilsonite emplacement.
        It is inferred that initial hydraulically induced fracturing of the Green
        River and overlying formations was a result of combined overpressure due to
        disequilibrium and regional extension with a possible contribution from the
        maturation of the source rock. This study recognised that the hydrocarbon
        was emplaced under a high pressure regime with evidence provide. by the existence
        of forcibly injected hydrocarbon sills. Hydrocarbons fractionated in the pre-existing
        vertical fractures to leave residual highly viscous and immobile hydrocarbons
        in veins seen at the present day. The third major component of this study
        detailed results from an assessment of the mechanical capacity of sealing
        rocks with respect to specific composition and mineralogy. It was found that
        increasing organic carbon decreased the compressive strength of the tested
        shale specimens. This relationship was interpreted as a possible result of
        the interaction of alkaline fluids to produce a dispersant which acts to reduce
        the cohesion of the organic rich shale.", "venue": "", "year": 1994, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Abstract 3810: BRCA2 is a moderate penetrance gene contributing
        to young onset prostate cancer, but not disease over 65 years", "abstract":
        "The aetiology of prostate cancer (PrCa) is poorly understood. A family history
        of prostate cancer, particularly at a young age, is a strong risk factor for
        the disease, indicating that inherited factors are important in PrCa. To date,
        the strongest genetic risk factor for PrCa is a protein truncating mutation
        in BRCA2, Studies in breast/ovarian cancer families have estimated a risk
        of \u223c5 fold in BRCA2 carriers. We previously estimated that 2.3% of PrCa
        cases diagnosed at \u226455 years harbour a BRCA2 mutation. PrCa in BRCA2
        carriers has been shown to be more aggressive, with poorer survival. To further
        evaluate the role of BRCA2 in PrCa predisposition we screened 1910 men with
        PrCa aged 36 to 86 years. Patients were recruited through the UKGPCS (UK Genetic
        Prostate Cancer Study Collaborators). The study was enriched for cases with
        an early age of onset (1639 men \u226465yrs) and/or positive family history
        of PrCa (271 men >65 with at least 2 affected relatives with PrCa). We analyzed
        the entire coding region of the BRCA2 gene in 46 PCR fragments by using a
        high-throughput multiplex fluorescent heteroduplex detection system developed
        for the ABI3130 genetic analyser. After repeats and QC 32 samples were excluded
        from the analysis. Fragments were analyzed for peak shifts corresponding to
        putative mutations in Genemapper v4.0 (Applied Biosystems) by visual inspection
        and using Bionumerics (Applied Maths). All fragments with peak-shifts were
        Sanger sequenced to characterise the mutation and validated using re-PCR and
        Sanger sequencing. We have identified 19 frameshift mutations, 3 in-frame
        deletions and 56 missense variants of uncertain significance (UV). Based on
        studies in breast/ovarian cancer families, most UVs and some in-frame deletions
        are likely to be neutral. All the carriers of frameshift mutations were affected
        at age \u226465 years, 12 patients had family history of prostate cancer and
        9 patients had some family history of breast or ovarian cancer. The prevalence
        of mutations was 1.25 % (8/638) for cases diagnosed \u226455 years and 1.17
        % (19/1620) for cases diagnosed \u2264 65 years. Based on the estimated frequency
        of BRCA2 mutations in the UK (0.16%) we estimate that mutations in the BRCA2
        gene confer a risk of prostate cancer of approximately 7 fold by age 65 (close
        to previous estimates from breast-ovarian cancer families), corresponding
        to an absolute risk of \u223c4% by age 65. As targeted treatments using drugs
        such as PARP inhibitors have shown activity in women with cancer who have
        BRCA mutations and as mutation tests become cheaper, there would be a rationale
        for testing young onset PrCa cases for BRCA2 mutations to offer such targeted
        treatments. Citation Format: {Authors}. {Abstract title} [abstract]. In: Proceedings

        Washington, DC\n\nABSTRACT\n\nBackground\n\nHand pattern (pattern of index
        compared to ring finger on the right hand, 2D:4D) has been studied for a number
        of decades as a potential predictor for disease occurrence. It is known to
        be associated with certain hormone related diseases developed during adult
        life but there have been no studies so far of 2D:4D ratio and prostate cancer
        risk. This study assesses the association between hand and prostate cancer.\n\nMethods\n\nWe
        analysed the right hand pattern and prostate cancer risk in 1524 cases aged
        \u2264 80 and 3044 population-based controls. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
        interval (CI) were calculated using multivariate logistic regression (to allow
        for adjustment of confounders) estimating whether there was any association
        between right hand pattern and the risk of prostate cancer.\n\nResults\n\nThe
        reference group was chosen to be the commonest hand pattern seen in males
        which is index finger shorter than ring finger. Compared to this group there
        was no difference in men with index finger equal to ring finger (OR 1.05,
        95% CI 0.88-1.25) whereas men with index finger longer than ring finger showed
        a negative association indicative of a marker of a protective effect with
        a 33% risk reduction compared to index finger shorter than ring finger (OR
        0.67, 95% CI 0.57-0.80).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis study showed that the pattern
        of finger lengths appears to be a community based surrogate marker of prostate
        cancer risk with length of 2D greater than 4D indicative of lower risk which
        has previously been shown to be also associated with lower prenatal testicular
        activity.\n\nNote: This abstract was not presented at the AACR 101st Annual
        Meeting 2010 because the presenter was unable to attend.\n\nCitation Format:

        cancer cells", "abstract": "AACR Annual Meeting-- Apr 12-16, 2008; San Diego,
        CA\n\n3583 \n\nPrevious studies have shown that aberrant expression of platelet
        derived growth factor (PDGF) is correlated with human cancer progression.
        Overexpression of PDGF receptor (PDGFR) is implicated in the progression of
        prostate cancer (PCa) bone metastases. However, the role of PDGF signaling
        in prostate cancer cell growth and survival has not been well characterized.
        We studied the implication of PDGF signaling in an ARCaP human PCa progression
        model, which demonstrates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and
        closely mimicking the clinical pathophysiology of human PCa bone metastasis.
        Treatment of metastatic ARCaPM cells with PDGFBB, an isoform of PDGF family,
        rapidly induced mRNA expression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1), an antiapoptoic
        factor that has been correlated to higher Gleason grades and metastasis in
        clinical PCa specimens. Western blotting and reporter analyses confirmed PDGFBB
        as a novel regulator of Mcl-1 expression in PCa cells. Mechanistic study indicated
        that PDGF induction of Mcl-1 is mediated by a beta-catenin-dependent pathway.
        PDGFBB treatment induced rapid nuclear translocation of beta-catenin in ARCaPM
        cells. Further analyses suggested that beta-catenin signaling may be coupled
        with other transcriptional factors, i.e., cAMP-responsive element-binding
        protein (CREB) and T-cell factor 4 (TCF-4), to coordinately regulate Mcl-1
        expression. Transient transfection of wild-type beta-catenin expression cDNA
        resulted in increased Mcl-1 expression, whereas a TCF-4 dominant negative
        cDNA effectively abrogated PDGFBB induction of Mcl-1 expression. In conclusion,
        these data demonstrate that activation of the PDGF-beta-catenin-Mcl-1 signaling
        may contribute to human PCa bone metastasis. Interruption of the Mcl-1 survival
        signal in addition to blocking the PDGF pathway may provide a novel target
        for the treatment of human PCa bone metastasis.", "venue": "", "year": 2008,

        an International Study: The PRACTICAL Consortium", "abstract": "A recent genome-wide
        association study found that genetic variants on chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 10,
        11, 19 and X were associated with prostate cancer risk. We evaluated the most
        significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in these loci using a worldwide
        consortium of 13 groups (PRACTICAL). Blood DNA from 7,370 prostate cancer
        cases and 5,742 male controls was analyzed by genotyping assays. Odds ratios
        (OR) associated with each genotype were estimated using unconditional logistic
        regression. Six of the seven SNPs showed clear evidence of association with
        prostate cancer (P = 0.0007-P = 10\u221217). For each of these six SNPs, the
        estimated per-allele OR was similar to those previously reported and ranged
        from 1.12 to 1.29. One SNP on 3p12 (rs2660753) showed a weaker association
        than previously reported [per-allele OR, 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.16;
        P = 0.06) versus 1.18 (95% confidence interval, 1.06-1.31)]. The combined
        risks associated with each pair of SNPs were consistent with a multiplicative
        risk model. Under this model, and in combination with previously reported
        SNPs on 8q and 17q, these loci explain 16% of the familial risk of the disease,
        and men in the top 10% of the risk distribution have a 2.1-fold increased
        risk relative to general population rates. This study provides strong confirmation
        of these susceptibility loci in multiple populations and shows that they make
        an important contribution to prostate cancer risk prediction. (Cancer Epidemiol

        the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 (MSR14) protein have been identified in
        men with prostate cancer, and several small studies have suggested that the
        999C>T (R293X) protein-truncating mutation may be associated with an increased
        risk for this disease. Methods: Using large case-control, cohort, and prostate
        cancer family studies conducted in several Western countries, we tested for
        the 999C>T mutation in 2,943 men with invasive prostate carcinoma, including
        401 males from multiple-case families, 1,982 cases unselected for age, and
        575 men diagnosed before the age of 56 years, and in 2,870 male controls.
        Risk ratios were estimated by unconditional logistic regression adjusting
        for country and by a modified segregation analysis. A meta-analysis was conducted
        pooling our data with published data. Results: The prevalence of MSR1*999C>T
        mutation carriers was 0.027 (SE, 0.003) in cases and 0.022 (SE, 0.002) in
        controls, and did not differ by country, ethnicity, or source. The adjusted
        risk ratio for prostate cancer associated with being a 999C>T carrier was
        1.31 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.93-1.84; P = 0.16]. The modified segregation
        analysis estimated the risk ratio to be 1.20 (95% CI, 0.87-1.66; P = 0.16).
        The risk ratio estimated from the meta-analysis was 1.34 (95% CI, 0.94-1.89;
        P = 0.10). Conclusion: Our large-scale analysis of case and controls from
        several countries found no evidence that the 999C>T mutation is associated
        with increased risk of prostate cancer. The meta-analysis suggests it is unlikely
        that this mutation confers more than a 2-fold increased risk.", "venue": "Cancer

        cancer-susceptibility genes conducted by the international consortium for
        prostate cancer genetics.", "abstract": "Evidence of the existence of major
        prostate cancer (PC)-susceptibility genes has been provided by multiple segregation
        analyses. Although genomewide screens have been performed in over a dozen
        independent studies, few chromosomal regions have been consistently identified
        as regions of interest. One of the major difficulties is genetic heterogeneity,
        possibly due to multiple, incompletely penetrant PC-susceptibility genes.
        In this study, we explored two approaches to overcome this difficulty, in
        an analysis of a large number of families with PC in the International Consortium
        for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). One approach was to combine linkage
        data from a total of 1,233 families to increase the statistical power for
        detecting linkage. Using parametric (dominant and recessive) and nonparametric
        analyses, we identified five regions with \"suggestive\" linkage (LOD score
        >1.86): 5q12, 8p21, 15q11, 17q21, and 22q12. The second approach was to focus
        on subsets of families that are more likely to segregate highly penetrant
        mutations, including families with large numbers of affected individuals or
        early age at diagnosis. Stronger evidence of linkage in several regions was
        identified, including a \"significant\" linkage at 22q12, with a LOD score
        of 3.57, and five suggestive linkages (1q25, 8q13, 13q14, 16p13, and 17q21)
        in 269 families with at least five affected members. In addition, four additional
        suggestive linkages (3p24, 5q35, 11q22, and Xq12) were found in 606 families
        with mean age at diagnosis of < or = 65 years. Although it is difficult to
        determine the true statistical significance of these findings, a conservative
        interpretation of these results would be that if major PC-susceptibility genes
        do exist, they are most likely located in the regions generating suggestive
        or significant linkage signals in this large study.", "venue": "American Journal

        "title": "Unravelling the genetics of prostate cancer", "abstract": "This
        review describes what is currently known about the genetics of prostate cancer.
        Traditionally, the genetics of a suspected inherited cancer predisposition
        have generally been thought of in terms of a single, high\u2010risk gene with
        a dominant mode of inheritance. Such a gene might be observed in families,
        as has been documented in familial breast cancer (BRCA1/2), familial colorectal
        cancer (HNPCC), retinoblastoma (RB1), and Wilms tumor (WT1). This review investigates
        the evidence for the existence, first of familial prostate cancer, and second,
        for the presence of such a high\u2010risk gene in those families by epidemiological
        and experimental approaches. Another current area of interest in prostate
        cancer is the investigation of the contribution of common lower penetrance
        genes to the disease. This alternative approach has become popular, as it
        raises the issue of frequently seen genetic variations such as single nucleotide
        polymorphisms (SNPs) having relevance to the risk of developing the disease.
        Finally, this article will explore the way forward, with emphasis on worldwide
        collaboration from teams attempting to find the genes responsible for the
        disease and investment in new technologies that will aid in their discovery.

        Admittedly they do not show whether cytochrome c is released from the mitochondria
        or that the caspases are truly activated, important events in the cell death
        pathway, but an increase in their expression does indicate their role in this

        these mutations were clustered outside the ovarian-cancer cluster region.
        The relative risk of developing prostate cancer by age 56 years from a deleterious
        germline BRCA2 mutation was 23-fold. Four of the patients with mutations did
        not have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer. Twenty-two variants
        of uncertain significance were also identified. These results confirm that
        BRCA2 is a high-risk prostate-cancer-susceptibility gene and have potential
        implications for the management of early-onset prostate cancer, in both patients

        sporadic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN). To investigate
        the possibility that CDKN2A may be involved in the inherited susceptibility
        to SCCHN, the 3 coding exons of CDKN2A were sequenced in 40 patients who had

        "Variation in the penetrance estimates for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations carriers
        suggests that other genetic polymorphisms may modify the cancer risk in carriers.
        A previous study has suggested that BRCA1 carriers with longer lengths of
        the CAG repeat in the androgen receptor (AR) gene are at increased risk of
        breast cancer (BC). We genotyped 188 BRCA1/2 carriers (122 affected and 66
        unaffected with breast cancer), 158 of them of Ashkenazi origin, 166 BC cases
        without BRCA1/2 mutations and 156 Ashkenazi control individuals aged over
        56 for the AR CAG and GGC repeats. In carriers, risk analyses were conducted
        using a variant of the log-rank test, assuming two sets of risk estimates
        in carriers: penetrance estimates based on the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium
        (BCLC) studies of multiple case families, and lower estimates as suggested
        by population-based studies. We found no association of the CAG and GGC repeats
        with BC risk in either BRCA1/2 carriers or in the general population. Assuming
        BRCA1/2 penetrance estimates appropriate to the Ashkenazi population, the
        estimated RR per repeat adjusted for ethnic group (Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi)
        was 1.05 (95%CI 0.97\u20131.17) for BC and 1.00 (95%CI 0.83\u20131.20) for
        ovarian cancer (OC) for CAG repeats and 0.96 (95%CI 0.80\u20131.15) and 0.90
        (95%CI 0.60\u20131.22) respectively for GGC repeats. The corresponding RR
        estimates for the unselected case\u2013control series were 1.00 (95%CI 0.91\u20131.10)
        for the CAG and 1.05 (95%CI 0.90\u20131.22) for the GGC repeats. The estimated
        relative risk of BC in carriers associated with \u226528 CAG repeats was 1.08
        (95%CI 0.45\u20132.61). Furthermore, no significant association was found
        if attention was restricted to the Ashkenazi carriers, or only to BRCA1 or
        BRCA2 carriers. We conclude that, in contrast to previous observations, if

        "abstract": "Editor\u2014Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common autosomal
        recessive disorders, with an incidence of one in every 2000 to 3000 white
        people. The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane
        conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene.1 Over 800 CFTR mutations have been identified.2
        Five mutations in Ashkenazi Jews,3 4 24 in whites,5 and 15 in African-Americans6
        account for 97%, 90%, and 75% of CF chromosomes in the respective populations.
        In contrast, 90% of CF Spanish alleles were contributed by as many as 75 mutations,
        indicating a heterogeneous CF genotype in Spain.7 The overall mutation spectrum
        and the frequency of common mutations in a particular population depend on
        the ethnic background. For example, the frequency of the W1282X mutation is
        1.2% in the white population, but it is as high as 60% in Ashkenazi Jews.8
        That of \u0394F508 is 70% in northern Europeans but it is less than 50% in
        Spanish and Hispanics.7 9 In order to provide accurate genetic counselling,
        it is necessary to determine the prevalent mutations in each ethnic group.
        A study of Hispanic CF patients from the south western United States showed
        that only 58% of Hispanic CF alleles were detected by screening 23 recurrent
        mutations.9 Thus, there is a need to identify the mutations accounting for
        the remaining Hispanic CF chromosomes. In addition, on identification of mutations
        genotype-phenotype correlation studies can be facilitated.\n\nThe clinical
        diagnosis of CF has been recently reviewed.10 Although the structure and function
        of \u0394F508 and W1282X mutant CFTR have been studied, there is a shortage
        of genotype-phenotype correlation studies of rare mutations, particularly
        the ones that appear to be unique to Hispanic CF patients. This is partly
        because of the lack of an effective method for \u2026", "venue": "Journal

        on the localisation of a chromosome segment at 1p36 which appeared to be linked
        (two point lod score=4.74) to a large number of families with multiple cases
        of early onset (mean age at diagnosis of <66 years) prostate cancer (PC) in
        which a brain tumour had been reported in a first or second degree relative
        of a PC case.1 This result is consistent with epidemiological evidence suggesting
        a familial relationship between brain cancer and PC as well as numerous studies
        of LOH at 1p36 in brain tumours.1 As part of the ACTANE (Anglo/Canadian/Texan/Australian/Norwegian/EU
        Biomed) familial PC Consortium, we have genotyped 207 multiple case PC families
        for five 1p36 tetranucleotide repeat polymorphisms, which were used by Gibbs
        et al ,1 and performed linkage analysis using GENEHUNTER2 with the following
        genetic map3: D1S1160 - 3.835 cM - D1S1597 - 4.339 cM - D1S407-2.611 cM -
        GATA29A05 (=D1S3669) - 6.520 cM - D1S552. In addition to our interest in assessing
        our families for evidence of linkage of prostate and primary brain cancer
        to this region, we also wanted to determine if any other cancer site(s) might
        be associated with a susceptibility locus in this region. To this end, the
        family histories of all cancers were abstracted from the databases of several
        Consortium members and included in the analysis.\n\nTable 1 presents the characteristics
        of the families; details on how they were ascertained are included in the
        footnotes. The criteria used for the prostate cancer familial clusters in
        this study are more relaxed than those suggested by the Hopkins group (referred

        "title": "Androgen receptor polymorphisms: Association with prostate cancer
        risk, relapse and overall survival", "abstract": "Several reports have suggested
        that one or both of the trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms in the human androgen
        receptor (hAR) gene, (CAG)n coding for polyglutamine and (GGC)ncoding for
        polyglycine, may be associated with prostate cancer risk; but no study has
        investigated their association with disease progression. We present here a
        study of both hAR trinucleotide repeat polymorphisms not only as they relate
        to the initial diagnosis but also as they are associated with disease progression
        after therapy. Lymphocyte DNA samples from 178 British Caucasian prostate
        cancer patients and 195 control individuals were genotyped by PCR for the
        (CAG)n and (GGC)n polymorphisms in hAR. Univariate Cox proportional hazard
        analysis indicated that stage, grade and GGC repeat length were individually
        significant factors associated with disease\u2010free survival (DFS) and overall
        survival (OS). The relative risk (RR) of relapse for men with more than 16
        GGC repeats was 1.74 (95% CI 1.08\u20132.79) and of dying from any cause,
        1.98 (1.13\u20133.45). Adjusting for stage and grade, GGC effects remained
        but were not significant (RRDFS= 1.60, p = 0.052; RROS= 1.65, p = 0.088).
        The greatest effects were in stage T1\u2010T2 (RRDFS= 3.56, 95% CI 1.13\u201311.21)
        and grade 1 (RRDFS= 6.47, 95% CI 0.57\u201372.8) tumours. No differences between
        patient and control allele distributions were found by odds\u2010ratio analysis,
        nor were trends with stage or grade evident in the proportion of short CAG
        alleles. Non\u2010significant trends with stage and grade were found in the
        proportion of short GGC alleles. The (GGC)n polymorphism in this population
        is a significant predictor of disease outcome. Since the (GGC)n effect is
        strongest in early\u2010stage tumours, this marker may help forecast aggressive
        behaviour and could be used to identify those patients meriting more radical

        at the BRCA2 locus in prostate cancer", "abstract": "Many epidemiological
        studies have reported an association between breast and prostate cancer. BRCA2
        functions as a tumour\u2010suppressor gene in about 35% of large familial
        breast\u2010cancer clusters; its role in the pathogenesis of sporadic breast
        cancer is less clear. We have evaluated immunohistochemical expression of
        BRCA2 protein and allelic loss of markers at the BRCA2 locus in tissue derived
        both from sporadic and from familial cases of prostate cancer. Immunohistochemical
        analysis was performed in 167 paraffin\u2010embedded archival specimens. Normal
        prostate and 75% (120/160) of prostate\u2010cancer tissue did not express
        BRCA2 protein. However, 25% (40/160) of cancer cases did express patchy staining;
        of these, 17% (27/160) expressed positive nuclear staining in normal glandular
        tissue adjacent to tumour (either in addition to, or, independent of tumour).
        Allelic loss is the hallmark of a tumour\u2010suppressor gene. Markers flanking
        (D13S267, D13S260) and within (D13S171) the BRCA2 gene indicated allelic loss
        in at least one locus in 23% (17/73) of tumours analyzed. There was no difference
        in the rates of allelic loss between sporadic and familial tumours, nor was
        there any association between immunohistochemical staining and allelic loss.
        Although immunohistochemical staining provided no useful prognostic information,
        allelic loss at BRCA2 was shown in univariate analysis to be associated with
        poorer survival (log\u2010rank test, p = 0.046). Int. J. Cancer 78:1\u20137,

        has only become significant since the advent of the industrial revolution,

        diseases and malnutrition have receded to reveal the scale of the problem.
        It has only become of major concern since about the middle of this century.
        Asthma is a disease characterised by wide variations over short periods of
        time in resistance to airflow in intrapulmonary airways [1]. This basic definition
        should be expanded to include the common symptoms of recurrent wheezing, airways
        hyperresponsiveness, frequent associations with exacerbation at night and
        induction by exogenous factors such as exercise and cold. Although there is
        difficulty in some cases of distinguishing asthma from other obstructive airways
        diseases, especially bronchitis, the proven reversibility of obstruction of
        at least 10-20% will usually sustain a diagnosis of asthma [2].", "venue":

        "title": "Design Mud Weight and Control Breakout Width Based on Angle of Intersection
        Analysis", "abstract": "\n Numerous wellbore instability problems have been
        reported when drilling through laminated shale formations because of anisotropic
        (weak) strength along bedding layers. The anisotropic strength is defined
        through the analysis of stress distributions around wellbore and angle of
        intersection (AOI) between well trajectory and weak bedding plane.\n This
        paper presents a method to calibrate a wellbore stability model, design mud
        weight and control breakout width based on analysis of AOI and anisotropic
        strength. The proposed method includes four (4) steps as follows:AOI is calculated
        by using bedding plane data (dip angle and dip azimuth) and well trajectory
        information (well inclination and azimuth).Based on single plane of weakness
        theory, the stress distributions around deviated wellbores in laminated shales
        are analyzed to show that failure can occur either along or across bedding
        planes depending on AOI.The profile of collapse pressure for both isotropic
        and anisotropic strength model are calculated along with the AOI.Drilling
        data (mud weight, cuttings/cavings pictures etc.) combined with azimuthal
        density image are used to choose and calibrate the wellbore stability model.\n
        Lab strength test results with different angle to bedding plane are used to
        calibrate rock strength model and field data are collected and analyzed to
        define acceptable breakout width. Field data demonstrates that AOI can have
        a significant effect on wellbore stability. It is observed that severe borehole
        problems occurred in hole sections with low AOI (<30\u00b0) especially when
        a low mud weight is used to allow a wider breakout. Minor wellbore instability
        still occurred in some hole sections with low AOI even when the zero breakout
        criteria was used for mud weight selection. The instability observed can be
        attributed to swab \u2013 decreased ESDs being exerted on the formation while
        pulling the bottom-hole-assembly out of the hole and time-dependent effect.\n
        The \u2018zero breakout width\u2019 criterion is recommended for AOI less
        than 30\u00b0, the \u2018(90\u00b0-Inclination) breakout width\u2019 criterion
        for AOI between 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0, and the \u2018(90\u00b0-2/3*Inclination)
        breakout width\u2019 criteria for AOI greater than 60\u00b0. If the mud weight
        window permits, then it would be beneficial to increase the mud weight by
        an extra 0.2 ppg to cover swab effects in shale formations that have an extremely
        low AOI (<15\u00b0). If not, mechanical means to prevent hydrostatic pressure
        drops such as slower pipe reciprocation or managed pressure drilling (MPD)
        need consideration.", "venue": "Day 2 Tue, October 04, 2022", "year": 2022,

        "title": "Optimize Internal Phase Salinity to Improve Wellbore Stability and
        Mitigate Lost Circulation", "abstract": "\n Wellbore instability and lost
        circulation are two major sources of non-productive time (NPT) in drilling
        operations worldwide. Non-aqueous fluid (NAF) is often chosen to mitigate
        this and minimize the chemical effect on wellbore instability in reactive
        shales. However, it may inadvertently increase the risk of losses. A simple
        method to optimize internal phase salinity (IPS) of NAF is presented to improve
        wellbore stability and mitigate the increased possibility of losses. Field
        cases are used to demonstrate the effects of salinity on wellbore instability
        and losses, and the application of the proposed method.\n IPS is optimized
        by managing bidirectional water movement between the NAF and shale formation
        via semi-permeable membrane. Typically, higher shale dehydration is designed
        for shallow reactive shale formation with high water content. Whereas, low
        or no dehydration is desired for deep naturally fractured or faulted formation
        by balancing osmotic pressure with hydrostatic pressure difference between
        mud pressure and pore pressure.\n The simple approach to managing this is
        as follows:\n The water activity profile for the shale formation (aw,shale)
        is developed based on geomechanical and geothermal information The water activity
        of drilling fluid (aw,mud) is defined through considering IPS and thermal
        effects The IPS of NAF is manipulated to manage whether shale dehydration
        is a requirement or should be avoided If the main challenge is wellbore instability
        in a chemically reactive shale, then the IPS should be higher than the equivalent
        salinity of shale formation (or aw,shale > aw, mud) If the main challenge
        is losses into non-reactive, competent but naturally fractured or faulted
        shale, then IPS should be at near balance with the formation equivalent salinity
        (or aw, shale \u2248 aw, mud)\n It is important that salt (e.g. calcium chloride
        \u2013 CaCl2) addition during drilling operations is done judiciously. The
        real time monitoring of salinity variations, CaCl2 addition, water evaporation,
        electric stability (ES), cuttings/cavings etc. will help determine if extra
        salt is required.\n The myth of the negative effects of IPS on wellbore instability
        and lost circulation is dispelled by analyzing the field data. The traditional
        Chinese philosophy: \"following Nature is the only criteria to judge if something
        is right\" can be applied in this instance of IPS optimization. A simple and
        intuitive method to manage IPS is proposed to improve drilling performance.",

        "title": "Treatment of Losses Based on Root Cause and Fracture Width Analysis",
        "abstract": "\n Lost circulation (LC) is extremely costly to many drilling
        operations due to loss of mud and productive time. Significant industry resources
        have been devoted to providing recommendations for both preventing and curing
        losses. These comprise bridging particles, settable pills and a focus on the
        better understanding, measurement and control of downhole pressures. The industry
        has also started to examine the relationship between downhole losses and fracture
        geometry. However, there has been very limited verification and utilization
        of such effort.\n Knowledge of the loss mechanism(s), location of the thief
        zone and fracture geometry is fundamental for understanding and treating losses
        effectively. The proposed method introduces a systematic approach for diagnosing
        lost circulation into potential root cause(s) by utilizing up to twenty-two
        diagnostic indicators. This allows the most appropriate treatments to be mapped
        to the suspected root cause. This technique supports the creation of preventative
        strategies during well planning. For example, if induced fractures are identified
        as the most likely root cause in the planning stage, then a wellbore strengthening
        formulation based on the fracture width estimation is recommended.\n A proper
        treatment can be designed based on the fracture width analysis as the data
        becomes invaluable in determining optimum sealing and effective treatment
        for losses into conductive natural fractures/faults. In case of loss events,
        the fracture width can be estimated based upon loss rate, the mud rheology,
        bottom hole pressure and pore pressure.\n Field experiences demonstrate that
        natural and induced fractures are the two most common root causes of losses.
        For induced fractures, fracture width usually develops beyond 3000-micron
        (\u00b5m) once losses have occurred and the preventive lost circulation materials
        (LCM) have not then worked effectively. If the bottom hole pressures can be
        kept below fracture propagation limits (or far-field minimum horizontal stress),
        then induced fractures will not cause significant volume of losses. The drilling
        induced fractures can be modelled by using in-situ stresses, well trajectory,
        bottom hole pressure, geothermal and mud temperature information.", "venue":

        "abstract": "Photographic history took root in the discipline of art history
        with its focus on pictures, and subsequent critical histories have largely
        retained this image-centred focus. Yet there is no inherent reason why the
        study of photography needed to become a history of pictures especially, as
        in some respects the images might not be the most important aspect of the
        practice. In recent years there has been a flurry of studies examining aspects
        of photographic industry and business arrangements. In this article I present
        some debates from the field of academic business history, which raise issues
        of relevance for historians of photography. Reese V. Jenkins\u2019s influential
        study of Kodak, Image and Enterprise (1975), provides the opportunity for
        investigating some of these issues. A short conclusion on the English daguerreotype

        "The narrative techniques of Conrad\u2019s shorter Malay and Indian Ocean
        fiction are examined to see the extent to which they either reveal or complicate
        and obscure interpretation and meaning, in their attempts to represent the
        colonial encounter. In the process, the paper seeks to balance the opposing
        claims of John Peters who absolves Conrad from \u2018epistemological solipsism
        and ethical anarchy\u2019 and those of Daniel Just who argues that \u2018the
        disintegration of meaning\u2019 is \u2018the only ethically acceptable response
        to the historical experience of colonialism\u2019. It also seeks to show how
        Conrad\u2019s narrative strategies, such as use of in medias res and achronology
        techniques as well as use of the first person narrator, changed through the
        course of his writing career. We therefore find different solutions to the
        question of whether the voice of the colonial Other can be articulated in
        \u2018Karain\u2019 and \u2018A Smile of Fortune\u2019. In the former, Karain
        is allowed to speak and implicitly challenge the narrator\u2019s values, although
        he worryingly seems to articulate his outlook in western terms. In the latter,
        the colonised voice is not heard at all as we struggle to work out what is
        happening through the lens of the narrator\u2019s prejudice and misogyny.
        The Shadow-Line , on the other hand, satisfyingly balances epistemological
        and ontological uncertainties as the Western sea-faring ideals of masculine
        self-sufficiency break down and colonial vulnerabilities are internalised.
        A first person narration here becomes a multi-voiced narrative. In their different
        ways, all three stories grapple with intractable issues involved in adequately
        characterising the colonial encounter. In addition, their epistemological
        quandaries and the murkiness of their insight express the intellectual, emotional
        and ethical frisson of the inevitable failure to attain a responsible state
        of being in a morally compromised universe.", "venue": "", "year": 2017, "referenceCount":

        with archival research on a controversy presented in the photographic press,
        which centred on the ideas of amateur photographer and journalist WJ Stillman.
        Drawing on the figures of the boot black who appears in Thompson\u2019s images
        and Stillman\u2019s argument, I criticise the predominant Foucaldian accounts
        of the representation of poor street traders and suggest that the worker (shoe
        black) introduces a far more troubling perspective into these images and arguments.
        The division between mental and manual labour is thus seen to ground the rhetorics
        and practices of photography. The essay suggests that thinking through the
        ambivalence displayed by Thompson towards ''demoralised'' labour might over
        another way of imagining the art/document couplet.", "venue": "", "year":

        patent law and authorship based on extensive archival research, examination
        of the current literature on intellectual property law, and theories of the
        self. It is the first output from my Leverhulme Trust funded research on intellectual
        property law, photography and biography. Included are ten previously unpublished
        early daguerreotypes. A work of cutting-edge cultural history which, through
        studying the case law of early photography legal depositions and affidavits,
        held at the National Record Office, Kew, this essay reflects on the way that
        authorship and careers were shaped and constrained. In addition to lectures
        in British universities, I have presented preliminary versions of this paper
        at Yale University and University of California, Berkeley and as key-note
        addresses at the University of Bergen and the University of Leeds. \nWhile
        there has been much recent discussion of copyright, patents remain under researched
        as cultural phenomena. However, I argue that patent law played a central role
        in defining modern conceptions of art and photography by joining intellectual
        property with image production, to create a distinctly modern sphere of authorship.
        My essay focuses on the prosecutions, conducted during the 1840s and 1850s,
        by the British patent holder for the daguerreotype - the merchant Richard
        Beard. Investigating Beard\u2019s business model for his three London studios
        and subsidiary licensed studios, I ask what authorship meant in the case of
        a mass-image producing enterprise, which employed dozens of operators as well
        as numerous subsidiary photographers all trading under license to Beard. My
        essay brings a fresh historical perspective to debates on the nature of authorship,
        considering the special characteristics of collective making and the mass

        "abstract": "In The Bowery in two inadequate descriptive systems (1974\u201375),
        Martha Rosler bridged the concerns of art with those of political documentary.
        The artwork, a series of twenty-one black-and-white photographs, twenty-four
        text panels and three blank panels, embraces the codes of the photo-text experiments
        of the period and applies them to the social reality of New York\u2019s Lower
        East Side. This artwork has played a key role in debates on contemporary art
        and aesthetics, but it has not been the object of careful scrutiny or analysis.
        \n \nIn this illustrated book, Steve Edwards offers three distinct approaches
        to the art work. First, he engages in a work of ekphrasis - a careful description
        of Rosler''s The Bowery. Edwards considers both the photographs and the text
        panels attending to the oddities and overlooked characteristics of the work.
        Secondly, the author contextualises the project in relation to the work of
        the San Diego Group, examines the prevailing view of the work as a critique
        of documentary photography and studies its relation to Jean-Luc Godard and
        other examples of political modernism. Here he also provides an overview of
        Rosler''s career and the place within her oeuvre of The Bowery. Thirdly, he
        offers a speculative reading of The Bowery within the pastoral tradition.
        In the process, this unlikely artwork is positioned in the long tradition
        of western poetics. \n \nThe book makes an original contribution to the discussion
        of contemporary art and political aesthetics through a meticulous study of
        one art work and an historical reconstruction of the cultural materials from
        which it was constructed. This study combines careful looking, historical
        research and draws extensively on critical theory to provide a model for approaching

        i els enllustradors de sabates", "abstract": "An essay translated into Catalan
        originally presented at a conference in Tarragona, Spain. An English version
        will appear late in 2013. \n \nBased around a study of the classic street
        photography of John Thompson, published a Street Life In Photography (1877)
        and the contemporaneous debate about photography that took place in the journal
        The Photographic News, this essay proposes a new account of photography. \n
        \nThompson, and others how worked in a similar mode, have been seen as exercising
        a vision of power that displays the poor for the attention of the state and
        middle-class reformers. In contrast, I suggest that Thompson''s images are
        much more ambivalent about the figures depicted. Thompson''s book is drawn
        to street life and he finds his own enterprise implicated in these trades.
        Through an analysis of WJ Stillman''s writings and photographs in Street Life
        in London, I consider the agency that speaks back in these photographs. \n
        \nThis essay is a product of extensive archival research on nineteenth-century
        photographic debate and conjoined this historical research with critical approaches

        proteins and hypothesis generation Page 13 Co-occurrence based systems are
        relatively easy to implement and have been popular in the production of end-user
        systems. However there are some drawbacks, for example as the relationship
        is defined simply as two terms which appear together, there is no knowledge
        about the directionality of the relationship. For example which protein is
        activating and which is being activated? This has meant that co-occurrence
        is not normally used in isolation but is combined with other methods as a
        part of the overall text-mining system. 2.1.3.2 Rule-based relation extraction
        Rule-based relation extraction systems were initially popular as they were
        relatively straightforward to implement by simply matching regular expressions
        within text. A small set of simple rules (such as \u201c[protein] is phosphorylated
        by [protein]\u201d) will capture commonly used phrases and therefore correctly
        capture a reasonable number of relationships. However, a very high number
        of rules would be required to catch all of the relevant relationships and
        the process of manually creating a set of rules to identify them is extremely
        tedious. Ono and Hishigaki (Ono et al., 2001) developed a rule-based system
        for extraction of protein interactions from yeast and E. coli literature achieving
        high recall (85%) and precision (94%), however this involved manually constructing
        rules for every interaction verb and is therefore substantially less transferable.
        Some systems such as (Corney et al., 2004, Chun et al., 2006) use rule-based
        algorithms to identify automatically biological relations from text thus reducing
        the time to build the system and apply it to a different subject area or domain.
        For example, Huang et al (Huang et al., 2004) align sentences and key interaction
        verbs as input for a pattern matching algorithm and report reasonable performance
        figures (recall of 80.0% and precision of 80.5%). Please see (Cohen and Hunter,
        2004) for a discussion of rule-based relation extraction methods. Rule-based
        relation extraction systems use more in depth analysis of the structure, syntax
        and semantics of a particular piece of text than co-occurrence based systems.
        Parsers are now relatively accurate at elucidating sentence structure from
        text; however the variability and frequent ambiguity of natural language still
        represents a difficulty, particularly over long and complex sentences. While
        these features are simple for a human to comprehend, they can cause many problems
        for computer algorithms; even where the sentence syntax is correctly identified
        the semantics may not be. Thus the work in biological relation extraction
        is moving away from rule-based systems towards machine learning approaches
        to the problem. Chapter 2 \u2013 Literature Review MilkMine: Text-mining,
        milk proteins and hypothesis generation Page 14 2.1.3.3 Machine learning based
        relation extraction Machine learning approaches are effectively a progression
        from semi-automatic rule-based systems where computer programs are \u2018trained\u2019
        to recognise relationships between tagged entities in a master text. They
        are given a set of sentences and are told the features of those sentences
        (for example the number of words in the sentence and their parts-of-speech)
        and the algorithm will try to pick out the relationships based upon the information
        it has been given. The output is then evaluated against the correct answer
        and the process is repeated until the relation extraction performance is maximized.
        Although this is an improvement over writing rules by hand, machine learning
        algorithms are heavily dependent on the availability of tagged corpora of
        text for training data. More recently the availability of these corpuses has
        been increasing in number and quantity; for example the GENIA corpus (Kim
        et al., 2003) is a collection of 2,000 Medline abstracts which have been manually
        annotated with biological entities by domain experts. A number of biological
        textmining systems have used this technique to perform relation extraction.
        For example Chun et al (Chun et al., 2006) applied machine learning to a corpus
        of prostate cancer documents and reported a relation extraction precision
        of 92.1%. 2.1.4 Hypothesis generation Once entities have been identified in
        text (Named Entity Recognition, see Section 2.1.2 ) and the relationships
        between them have been extracted into a standard format (Relation Extraction,
        see Section 2.1.3 ), analysis can be performed over the entire set of relations.
        One of these analyses is hypothesis generation (or Knowledge Discovery) whose
        aim is to use the set of relationships gathered by relation extraction to
        make novel or indirect connections between biological concepts which may not
        have been previously recorded in the scientific literature (see Figure 1.2).
        Hypothesis generation (HG) was first utilized in a groundbreaking study by
        Don Swanson in 1986 where he noticed that there a complementary overlap between
        the scientific literature describing the causes and symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s
        Disease, and the physiological effects of fish oil consumption (Swanson, 1986).
        Swanson was able to show that the symptoms of Raynaud\u2019s Disease could
        be alleviated by the physiological action of fish oil, purely by textual analysis
        of 1 http://compbio.uchsc.edu/ccp/corpora/obtaining.shtml Chapter 2 \u2013
        Literature Review MilkMine: Text-mining, milk proteins and hypothesis generation
        Page 15 the two literatures. Thus a hypothesis was generated which has been
        subsequently replicated in other studies (Cole and Bruza, 2005, Gordon and
        Lindsay, 1996, Weeber et al., 2001, Weeber et al., 2000, Wren, 2004) and has
        been proven in clinical testing (DiGiacomo et al., 1989). Hypothesis Generation
        can be performed in two ways: between two user-defined concepts (Closed Discovery),
        as Swanson used between Raynaud\u2019s Disease and Fish oil, or directly from
        a single given concept (Open Discovery). 2.1.4.1 Closed discovery hypothesis
        generation (HG) Closed Discovery requires an initial proposed hypothesis that
        there is a link between two concepts; a starting concept (A) and a target
        concept (C). However, it can then be used to identify a number of novel or
        unnoticed linking (or intermediate) concepts between A and C. An example hypothesis
        could be, \u2018Is there a biological connection between the protein plasmin
        and mammary gland involution?\u2019 A literature search for A is carried out
        and NER and relation extraction are performed to give a set of relationships
        for A. This process is repeated for C. The hypothesis can then be examined
        by looking at literature relationships which have a common intermediate concept
        (B) between the A-B and C-B literature relation sets identified in the relation
        extraction process (see 2.1.3 ). A Closed Discovery HG program will follow
        the steps below: 1. The user must choose two concepts to form the initial
        proposed hypothesis (start concept A and target concept C). The HG program
        will then: 2. Find all significant relationships from the literature between
        the start concept A and other biological concepts (intermediate concepts BA1,
        BA2, BA3...BAn). 3. Find all significant relationships from the literature
        between the target concept C and other biological concepts (intermediate concepts
        BC1, BC2, BC3...BCn). 4. Identify intermediate concepts that are common between
        the A-B and C-B relationship sets. By mapping A \u2192 B \u2190 C relationships,
        potentially undiscovered A \u2013 C relationships can be identified for further
        investigation (see Figure 2.5). 1 Involution is the process of remodelling
        the mammary gland after lactation has ceased. Chapter 2 \u2013 Literature

        16 2.1.4.2 Open discovery hypothesis generation Open discovery requires only
        a single concept of interest as a starting point. Literally, \u2018generate
        some hypotheses about [concept A]\u2019. An Open Discovery HG program will
        follow the steps below: 1. The user must choose a concept to generate hypotheses
        from (start concept A). The HG program will then: 2. Find all significant
        relationships from the literature relation set between the start concept A
        and other biological concepts (intermediate concepts B1, B2, B3...Bn). 3.
        Find all significant relationships from the literature relation set between
        each of the intermediate concepts (B1, B2, B3...Bn) identified in step 2 and
        other biological concepts (target concepts C1, C2, C3...Cn). 4. Identify significant
        A-B and B-C relationship sets. By mapping A \u2192 B and B \u2192 C relationships,
        potentially undiscovered A \u2013 C relationships can be identified for further
        investigation (see Figure 2.5). While Open Discovery has the advantage of
        automatically generating hypotheses completely from scratch, it is much more
        computationally expensive and will potentially produce a huge number of hypotheses.
        A starting concept will invariably be related to many intermediate concepts,
        which in turn will be related to many target concepts (see Figure 2.5). Thus,
        although there is no user input required to complete Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the
        Open Discovery process, it requires more processing of the set of A \u2192
        B \u2192 C hypotheses that are produced. Chapter 2 \u2013 Literature Review

        of publications discussing gene-related discoveries, presents a major data
        analysis challenge. Current methods for genome-wide analysis of expression
        data typically rely on cluster analysis of gene expression patterns. Clustering
        indeed reveals potentially meaningful relationships among genes, but can not
        explain the underlying biological mechanisms. In an attempt to address this
        problem, we have developed a new approach for utilizing the literature in
        order to establish functional relationships among genes on a genome-wide scale.
        Our method is based on revealing coherent themes within the literature, using
        a similarity-based search in document space. Content-based relationships among
        abstracts are then translated into functional connections among genes. We
        describe preliminary experiments applying our algorithm to a database of documents
        discussing yeast genes. A comparison of the produced results with well-established
        yeast gene functions demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.", "venue":

        "title": "Land Judging Clinic: A Cooperative Learning Experience", "abstract":
        "How do you practice land judging without access to a soil pit? You partner
        with someone who has one! Here''s a success story from North Carolina.The
        University of Mount Olive (UMO) is one of three postsecondary schools in North
        Carolina that offer Bachelor of Science degrees in agriculture. Students in
        all of the agriculture degree programs at UMO are required to take AGE 360:
        Soil Science. This class is an in-depth study of soils and their uses. The
        focus on physical, chemical, and biological properties of soils allows students
        to gain a greater appreciation of this natural resource. A required lab section
        provides hands-on training for students to better understand properties of
        the numerous soil types found throughout North Carolina.Almost half of the
        students enrolled in the soil science class are agricultural education majors.
        To help train these students to teach about soils and their properties, one
        of the lab sessions simulates an FFA land judging contest. The instructor
        works with a local research farm to establish several soil pits. These pits
        expose students to working with soil pits while reinforcing instruction about
        physical, chemical, and biological soil properties and processes. Conducting
        a mock land judging contest is an additional instructional tool to reinforce
        the principles of soil classification and determine use class (agricultural
        or urban) for the soil. As the mock land judging contest begins, students
        judge the soils according to the contest guidelines. Then the instructor reviews
        each pit and explains the parameters for the correct answers. The lab is very
        popular and reinforces many concepts taught in the classroom.In 2013, the
        North Carolina FFA Association moved the State Fand Judging Career Development
        Event (CDE) from the spring to the fall. Prior to this change, teams had to
        qualify for the state event by finishing first, second, or third in a federation
        contest held in the fall or late winter. When the state event was moved to
        the fall, it was restructured as an open event; any FFA chapter in North Carolina
        could send a team. Because federation contests were no longer required for
        state qualification, most federations stopped holding a local event. This
        change led to a new dilemma: Without local events, many teams had never seen
        or worked with a soil pit before the state event.In the summer of 2013, a
        local high school agriculture teacher met with UMO faculty to discuss the
        possibility of cooperating with the university to hold a land judging clinic
        for secondary agriculture students. A university-hosted mock land judging
        contest would provide an opportunity for secondary students to work with soil
        pits prior to the state event.The UMO soil science instructor contacted the
        Cherry Research Farm, one of the state research stations operated by the North
        Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. The station superintendent
        agreed to host the clinic, and two dates (initial date and rain date) were
        set in October 2013. The secondary agriculture teacher agreed to assist and
        created slope stakes, field border stakes, and measurement stakes for each
        pit.The land judging clinic was conducted to mirror the State FFA Fand Judging
        CDE. Cherry Research Farm staff prepared four soil pits. As in the state competition,
        soil pits were located in separate fields and included two piles of soil material:
        a smaller pile labeled \"surface layer\" and a larger piles labeled \"subsurface
        layer\" (Naderman, 2009, p. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "referenceCount":

        In 1990, FHWA began offering the add-on program, which allowed state departments
        of transportation (DOTs) and metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) to
        purchase additional sample data for their local areas. In the 2009 NHTS, the
        Tennessee DOT purchased addon sample data for use by the state DOT and MPOs.
        To derive the most benefit from the data, the Tennessee DOT sponsored a study
        to determine how previous add-on program participants had used the samples
        and what lessons the participants had learned in those applications, as well
        as to identify the best practices to maximize program benefits. A literature
        review and Internet and phone surveys were used to ascertain this information.
        The major findings of the study included (a) the add-on participants'' opinion
        that the program was a cost-effective way of obtaining data that are consistent
        at the local, state, and national levels; (b) the use of the data in a wide

        new federal regulations and an increased pressure by national and local advocacy
        groups to accommodate bicyclists and pedestrians in transportation projects.
        To meet these demands, state and local transportation planning agencies must
        often rely on data sets derived from small samples and with little previous
        application to develop user characteristics and travel demand models that
        estimate the effect an increase in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure will
        have on the transportation network. One of the main sources for data on travel
        and transportation available to industry professionals is the National Household
        Travel Survey (NHTS), which FHWA conducts every 5 to 7 years and which provides
        data sets on daily travel for all transportation modes, including information
        on driver characteristics, travel time, trip purpose, time of day, and day
        of the week a trip took place. An add-on program with NHTS offers agencies
        an opportunity to obtain local data that may be used for bicycle and pedestrian

        "title": "Attracting Students to Transportation Engineering", "abstract":
        "With a significant fraction of the nation''s transportation workforce nearing
        retirement age, it is essential to attract new talent to transportation fields
        and to retain that talent. In addition, it is also important to attract a
        diverse workforce, because women and minorities are still significantly under-represented
        in transportation engineering and related fields. To address the nation''s
        transportation workforce needs, FHWA, the U.S. Department of Transportation,
        the Institute of Transportation Engineers, and other leading transportation
        organizations emphasize the importance of outreach activities in kindergarten
        through 12th grade. In particular, programs directed at middle and high school
        students are essential for increasing the pipeline of transportation students
        and professionals. One such program at the University of Memphis in Tennessee,
        Transportation Engineering Careers (TREC), is designed to increase high school
        students\u2019 interest in transportation careers through a week-long, fast-paced,
        active learning environment. This paper first provides a review of relevant
        literature and then presents assessment findings from the first 2 years of
        the TREC program regarding gender differences and student perceptions of transportation
        engineering. Finally, lessons learned and implications for similar efforts

        "title": "Going the Extra Mile: Giving Middle School Students outside the
        Classroom Experience", "abstract": "Four hundred unpaid hours, no options
        for flex time, and that is for just one of the many events participated in
        by North Buncombe Middle School. Why on earth would one teacher dedicate all
        that time with no benefits to one event? The answer: Students enjoy showing
        livestock and gaining the life experiences that comes with the showing of
        animals. Middle school agricultural teachers, like our high school counterparts,
        truly understand the benefits of developing complete agricultural education
        students While middle school agricultural programs often do not receive the
        same level of promotion as high school agricultural programs, middle school
        agricultural education programs are just as viable in developing students
        for potential careers in the agricultural industry. North Buncombe Middle
        School is located in western North Carolina in the town of Weaverville. While
        agriculture is a key contributor to the economy, many students in this community
        do not understand this vital industry. As a middle school agriculture teacher,
        I have the opportunity to teach every seventh grader and half of the eighth
        graders through a six week student rotation. As a teacher, one must be creative
        to provide a successful educational experience to thirty students who have
        different opinions and perceptions of agriculture. The key to overcoming these
        challenges is to get students involved with a positive educational experience.
        Through classroom activities, I promote FFA in hopes that students will join
        and take advantage of these positive experiences eventually \"developing their
        potential for premier leadership, personal growth, and career success.\" The
        main goal of this article is to share some of the out-of -classroom experiences
        that are offered through the North Buncombe Middle School FFA Chapter. Through
        service projects, FFA allows students to become leaders in the community as
        well as the classroom. One program that we participated in is an \"Apple Gleaning\"
        project with the North Carolina Farm Bureau Young Farmer and Rancher program
        and the Society of St. Andrew. This fall, North Buncombe Middle FFA members
        picked 110 bushels equaling approximately 6,000 pounds. The service project
        allowed students to see what hard work produced. They were able to complete
        a service for others and to gain valuable leadership skills that they will
        remember and share in their community. The service project was also educational;
        while in the apple orchard students also observed a combine picking corn and
        had an opportunity to learn about corn production as well as the many uses
        of corn. One of our major chapter FFA events is livestock showing, including
        the showing of: market lambs, meat goats, breeding ewes, heifers, and pigs.
        If students do not have a place to keep their animal, they are allowed to
        raise the animals on my farm. After raising the animals and preparing them
        for show, the students show the animals at many local, regional and state-wide
        fairs and events. \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "referenceCount": 0,

        "title": "Developing Leaders through Service", "abstract": "Living to Serve,
        the last line of the FFA motto for decades, succinctly sums up what we want
        from all of our current and former members: individuals who through their
        service will benefit the community-at-large. Seeing the importance of developing
        service in its members, the National FFA Organization has created the new
        service requirement for earning Chapter, State, and American FFA Degrees.
        Beginning in 2011, each degree will require service hours, separate from any
        hours reported elsewhere in the respective degree application. Completing
        service projects are already goals of most FFA chapters. Many chapters operate
        food drives, volunteer at county fairs, landscape schools and other public
        buildings, build/repair equipment or structures for the community, visit residents
        in assisted living homes, or provide people power partnering with other community
        organizations. Service projects are beneficial in their outcomes for those
        affected, including the people who are providing the service. Leadership development
        potential for participants in service projects is a great way to incorporate
        leadership development in all chapter members. It is natural to look at our
        chapter officer positions when we are evaluating our FFA leadership development
        process. Service as a chapter officer is a great way to develop leadership
        skills for the members'' future endeavors, but most chapters only have from
        six to twelve officers per year. We also look at leadership conferences and
        state and national conventions, but many of the members that attend the conferences
        and conventions either have or will serve as chapter officers. The problem
        that pertains for many advisors is how to develop leadership in all chapter
        members, not just the members that serve in our traditional leadership roles.
        An option for local chapters is to use service learning as a tool for leadership
        development. Service learning characterizes a variety of experiential education
        endeavors including volunteer and community service projects (Furco, 1996).
        Comprehensive reviews of research on service learning reveal that service
        learning has a positive effect on students'' personal and interpersonal development,
        including leadership skills and the ability to work well with others (Astin,
        et al., 2006; Eyler, Giles, Stenson, & Gray, 2001). Service-learning also
        has been shown to have a positive impact on students'' academic learning as
        well as their career development and ability to apply what they have learned
        in the \"real world\" (Eyler, et al., 2001; Rhee & Honeycutt Sigler, 2010).
        The National FFA Organization sponsors many service opportunities that can
        also be used as leadership learning activities. One program that provides
        great one-on-one leadership training is Partners in Active Learning Support
        (PALS.) PALS can provide great leadership training in a few areas. One leadership
        area is program planning. Because PALS visits have a specific length of time
        and a specific purpose, making some of your students responsible for planning
        a specific visit gives them a semicontrolled opportunity to start their leadership
        training. Assistance aides can be found at the FFA Unlimited website. Other
        great options include individual states'' Agriculture in the Classroom programs
        and individual agriculture commodity associations. Another way that you can
        use PALS to assist with leadership training is to make students responsible
        for arranging all of the materials before, during, and after a PALS visit.
        Agriculture programs are attractive to special needs students due to the hands-on
        nature of our classes. Some of the special needs students in our classes,
        however, can have underdeveloped reading skills, lower even than the elementary
        students that we may be working with in PALS. \u2026", "venue": "", "year":

        Earth and Environmental Sciences", "abstract": "Abstract Fieldwork is an essential
        component of any degree in geography and the earth and environmental sciences
        (GEES). Graduates with these degrees need to have received adequate appropriate
        field training. Academic staff involved in running fieldwork invest a large
        amount of time and effort in this activity and really only benefit if they
        can demonstrate some tangible output for their efforts. At the University
        of Greenwich, field-based research and teaching are highly integrated in some
        subjects in order to enhance teaching and learning activities for students
        and to maximise benefits to staff in terms of scholarly output and improved
        teaching materials. A highly successful, on-going process presently in operation
        at Greenwich is as follows: staff use their field-based research to inform
        their teaching and to stimulate interest in their researchjnterested students
        undertake their final-year research project allied to staff research; student
        research then informs staff research and aids enhancement of teaching; the
        cycle continues and increases the link between research and teaching to the
        mutual benefit of both staff and students. Taken a step further, this linkage
        may be successfully used to develop field guides and virtual field trips1.
        The latter can be particularly important for widening access for disabled
        students who are unable to fully participate in traditional field activities.",

        "Often, the desired behavior of a system is known before a design of the system

        into a system that exhibits it. Thisreport describes two algorithms that design
        systems guaranteed to exhibit specified behavior. Specif ically, our algorithms
        identify a state machine with the fewest states exhibiting behavior specified
        by a set of input/output strings. One algorithm builds the machine explicitly
        by fitting together transitions that correspond to input/output pairs. The
        other implicitly considers all machines of a given size and discards those
        not exhibiting the desired behavior. Although the problem is NP-complete,
        ouralgorithms behave exponentially only inthe number ofstates in the minimummachine;
        other state-minimizationalgorithms behave exponentially in the size of the
        behavior specification. This advantage has allowed machines of up to fourteen
        states to be identified exactly within an hour.", "venue": "", "year": 1995,

        "title": "Comparative study of ecotourism policy in the Americas - 1998",
        "abstract": "Foreword Tourism''s importance in the economy of the Member States
        of the OAS has steadily grown during the last decade. Concurrently there has
        been an increase in competition, a need to satisfy environmental obligations
        and the need to respond to the market''s need for alternative tourism products.
        Ecotourism, one of the emerging tourism alternatives, is the result of the
        changes in the values and the habits of people. The countries throughout the
        hemisphere have implemented many different ecotourism strategies and policies
        for the promotion of natural attractions, the protection of the environment,
        and of the quality of life. Much is to be learned by the analysis of all these
        different approaches. It is for this reason that the Inter-Sectoral Unit for
        Tourism, within the framework of the technical cooperation provided by the
        Organization of American States to its members, decided to support this \"Comparative
        Study of Ecotourism Policy.\" We hope that the dissemination of this study
        may contribute to a better understanding of the different approaches possible
        in the support of ecotourism and the development of its policies. Acknowledgements
        First and foremost, we would like to thank the people in the government tourism
        agencies throughout the Americas who participated in this project by sharing
        with us their experiences with ecotourism. Without their valuable input this
        study would not have been possible. Second, we want to thank the Inter-Sectoral
        Unit for Tourism of the Organization of American States (OAS) for providing
        partial funding and sharing its ecotourism expertise and library resources.
        Third, we want to recognize the assistance from the University of Idaho Research
        Office for partially funding our travel to Washington DC. Finally, we owe
        a very special debt to the Department of Resource Recreation and Tourism,
        in the College of Forestry, Wildlife and Ranges Sciences at the University
        of Idaho for logistical support, partial funding, and the commitment of faculty
        and graduate students to this endeavor. Besides organizations, many individuals
        have been supportive in this team effort. We especially thank Marina Cracco
        for her invaluable work in conducting interviews with the Spanish-speaking
        respondents, revision of translations from Spanish to English and in translating
        documents, interview scripts, ecotourism definitions, and the database into
        Spanish. Thanks also to Alicia Alem\u00e1n for her work translating the final
        reports into Spanish, to Debbie McLaughlin for the translation of documents
        from French to English, and to Oliver Hillel for reviewing the documents translated
        from \u2026", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "referenceCount": 64, "citationCount":

        The major aim of this study is the investigation and definition of a baseline
        architecture for a smart aerospace structure which can detect and isolate
        structural damage in real-time and provide on-line reconfiguration of the
        structure''s control system under the detected impairment conditions. In particular,
        we investigate how a smart aerospace structure can be implemented as a real-time
        knowledge based expert system by addressing issues involved with structural
        knowledge representation, structural damage detection and isolation strategies
        and real-time performance in an embedded environment. Keywords: Damage assessment;

        are diverted along four traveling water screens installed in a chevron arrangement

        fish return to the lake. Three years of information on the operational and

        presented and discussed. System components are discussed in terms of maintenance
        requirements and operation relative to an adjacent conventional intake system
        (Unit 5). Hydraulic measurements are also presented. Biological effectiveness
        of this system is compared with that of a once\u2010through system with conventional

        of an electrode electrochemically at the first step before a potential difference
        is measured and applying electric pulses which cover the electrode electrochemically
        to a silver electrode by using halogenated silver having a halogenated ion
        rate of a solution or a dispersed liquid at the next step. CONSTITUTION: A
        current source 6 and a switch mechanism 7 are connected with a timer/controller
        4 to control time of an electric pulse which is applied, delay time after
        a pulse is applied, changeover to the measurement of potential difference,
        measurement time, etc. A pulse which peels a thin layer on a surface of an
        electrode 2 electrochemically as a first phase is applied before potential
        difference is measured. Next, a pulse which covers the electrode 2 with halogenated
        silver which coincides with a halogenated ion rate of a halogenated silver
        solution 9 is applied as a second phase. Pulse width and amplitude of the
        first phase are made larger than those of the second phase to peel a covering
        of the electrode 2 completely. Consequently, a new surface of the electrode
        2 is formed per cycle of measurement to improve measurement accuracy.", "venue":

        An initial laboratory study asking for real, personal data demonstrated increased

        faces in children and adults.", "abstract": "It is considerably harder to
        generalize identity across different pictures of unfamiliar faces, compared
        with familiar faces. This finding hints strongly at qualitatively distinct
        processing of unfamiliar face stimuli-for which we have less expertise. Yet,
        the extent to which face selective versus generic visual processes drive outcomes
        during this task has yet to be determined. To explore the relative contributions
        of each, we contrasted performance on a version of the popular Telling Faces
        Together unfamiliar face matching task, implemented in both upright and inverted
        orientations. Furthermore, we included different age groups (132 British children
        ages 6 to 11 years [69.7% White], plus 37 British White adults) to investigate
        how participants'' experience with faces as a category influences their selective
        utilization of specialized processes for unfamiliar faces. Results revealed
        that unfamiliar face matching is highly orientation-selective. Accuracy was
        higher for upright compared with inverted faces from 6 years of age, which
        is consistent with selective utilization of specialized processes for upright
        versus inverted unfamiliar faces during this task. The effect of stimulus
        orientation did not interact significantly with age, and there was no graded
        increase in the magnitude of inversion effects observed across childhood.
        Still, a numerically larger inversion effect in adults compared to children
        provides a degree of support for developmental changes in these specialized
        face abilities with increasing age/experience. Differences in the pattern
        of errors across age groups are also consistent with a qualitative shift in
        unfamiliar face processing that occurs some time after 11 years of age. (PsycInfo

        this article, we give an overview of what is known about the building blocks

        to bear new findings on the initiation of shared attention that complement
        knowledge about gaze following and incorporate new insights from research

        first-, second-, and third-order social cognitive processes (the shared-attention
        system, or SAS), building on previous models and approaches. The SAS model
        aims to encompass perceptual, cognitive, and affective processes that contribute
        to and follow on from the establishment of shared attention. These processes

        Here, we investigated the neurophysiological correlates of the processing

        These observed gaze responses could either establish, or fail to establish,
        joint attention. We implemented a gaze leading paradigm in which participants
        made a saccade from an on-screen face to an object, followed by the on-screen
        face either making a congruent or incongruent gaze shift. An N170 event-related
        potential was elicited by the peripherally located gaze shift stimulus. Critically,
        the N170 was greater for joint attention than non-joint gaze both when task-irrelevant
        (Experiment 1) and task-relevant (Experiment 2). These data suggest for the
        first time that the neurocognitive system responsible for structural encoding

        "abstract": "Efficiently judging where someone else is looking is important
        for social interactions, allowing us a window into their mental state by establishing
        joint attention. Previous work has shown that judging the gaze direction of
        a non-foveally presented face is facilitated when the eyes of that face are
        directed towards the centre of the scene. This finding has been interpreted
        as an example of the human bias for misattributing observed ambiguous gaze
        signals as self-directed eye-contact. To test this interpretation against
        an alternative hypothesis that the facilitation is instead driven by the establishment
        of joint attention, we conducted two experiments in which we varied the participants\u2019
        fixation location. In both experiments, we replicated the previous finding
        of facilitated gaze discrimination when the participants fixated centrally.
        However, this facilitation was abolished when participants fixated peripheral
        fixation crosses (Experiment 1) and reversed when participants fixated peripheral
        images of real-world objects (Experiment 2). Based on these data, we propose
        that the facilitation effect is consistent with the interpretation that gaze
        discrimination is facilitated when joint attention is established. This finding
        therefore extends previous work showing that engaging in joint attention facilitates
        a range of social cognitive processes.", "venue": "Quarterly Journal of Experimental

        which previous experience of joint gaze with people (i.e., looking toward
        the same object) modulates later gaze cueing of attention elicited by those
        individuals. Participants in Experiments 1 and 2a/b first completed a saccade/antisaccade
        task while a to-be-ignored face either looked at, or away from, the participants''
        eye movement target. Two faces always engaged in joint gaze with the participant,
        whereas 2 other faces never engaged in joint gaze. Then, we assessed standard
        gaze cueing in response to these faces to ascertain the effect of these prior
        interactions on subsequent social attention episodes. In Experiment 1, the
        face''s eyes moved before the participant''s target appeared, meaning that
        the participant always gaze-followed 2 faces and never gaze-followed 2 other
        faces. We found that this prior experience modulated the timecourse of subsequent
        gaze cueing. In Experiments 2a/b, the participant looked at the target first,
        then was either followed (i.e., the participant initiated joint gaze), or
        was not followed. These participants then showed an overall decrement of gaze
        cueing with individuals who had previously followed participants'' eyes (Experiment
        2a), an effect that was associated with autism spectrum quotient scores and
        modulated perceived trustworthiness of the faces (Experiment 2b). Experiment
        3 demonstrated that these modulations are unlikely to be because of the association
        of different levels of task difficulty with particular faces. These findings
        suggest that establishing joint gaze with others influences subsequent social
        attention processes that are generally thought to be relatively insensitive
        to learning from prior episodes.", "venue": "Journal of Experimental Psychology.

        "abstract": "Here, we report a novel social orienting response that occurs
        after viewing averted gaze. We show, in three experiments, that when a person
        looks from one location to an object, attention then shifts towards the face
        of an individual who has subsequently followed the person''s gaze to that
        same object. That is, contrary to \u2018gaze following\u2019, attention instead
        orients in the opposite direction to observed gaze and towards the gazing
        face. The magnitude of attentional orienting towards a face that \u2018follows\u2019
        the participant''s gaze is also associated with self-reported autism-like

        "title": "Social orienting in gaze-based interactions: Consequences of joint
        gaze", "abstract": "Abstract \nJointly attending to a shared referent with
        other people is a social attention behaviour that occurs often and has many
        developmental and ongoing social impacts. This thesis focused on examining
        the online, as well as later emerging, impacts of being the gaze leader of
        joint attention, which has until recently been under-researched. A novel social
        orienting response that occurs after viewing averted gaze is reported, showing
        that a gaze leader will rapidly orient their attention towards a face that
        follows their gaze: the gaze leading effect. In developing the paradigm necessary
        for this illustration a number of boundary conditions were also outlined,
        which suggest the social context of the interaction is paramount to the observability
        of the gaze leading effect. For example, it appears that the gaze leading
        effect works in direct opposition to other social orienting phenomenon (e.g.
        gaze cueing), may be specific to eye-gaze stimuli, and is associated with
        self-reported autism-like traits. This orienting response is suggested as
        evidence that humans may have an attention mechanism that promotes the more
        elaborate social attention state of shared attention. This thesis also assessed
        the longer term impacts of prior joint gaze interactions, finding that gaze
        perception can be influenced by prior interactions with gaze leaders, but
        not with followers, and further there is evidence presented that suggests
        a gaze leader\u2019s attention will respond differently, later, to those whom
        have or have not previously followed their gaze. Again, this latter finding
        is associated with autism-like traits. Thus, the current work opens up a number
        of interesting research avenues concerning how attention orienting during
        gaze leading may facilitate social learning and how this response may be disrupted
        in atypically developing populations.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        "abstract": "Abstract : Vibration isolation on spacecraft is needed for imaging
        sensors, microgravity experiments, and other sensitive payloads. The preferred
        method thus far has been passive isolation because of its simplicity and low
        cost. Active vibration isolation and disturbance rejection will soon be more
        common as space qualified sensors, actuators and processors become more capable
        and affordable, and performance requirements increase. Spacecraft disturbances
        are typically periodic vibrations which are most effectively controlled through
        feedforward techniques. A popular choice of feedforward control methods for
        disturbance rejection is the Multiple Error Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm
        which requires a separately measured disturbance correlated signal in its
        implementation. A new technique called Clear Box makes extensive use of identification
        to bring out information that is normally hidden or not used by traditional
        control methods. It allows operation in an information rich environment with
        built in fault tolerance, the ability to control unanticipated disturbances,
        and the ability to select which modes to control (if saturation of the actuators
        is a possibility or concern), all without the need for a separately measured
        disturbance correlated signal. Experiments using both Multiple Error LMS and
        Clear Box on an Ultra Quiet Platform provide an effective demonstration of
        the advantages of the Clear Box Algorithm, including a new Adaptive Basis
        Method which allows control of rapidly varying frequencies.", "venue": "",

        grasps are unique in that the homogeneous solution for the contact forces
        always produces a grasp force focus. Careful positioning of this focus point
        in the grasp plane can help avoid two things; slipping at the contact points,
        and violation of joint torque limits. The focus placement method is explored
        theoretically by examining two types of grasps on cylinders; 1) fingertip
        grasps using three independently operated fingers, and 2) single-finger power
        grasps with one contact point on each of three links. Constraint maps are
        generated for various fingertip grasps in order to show how proper placement
        of the grasp force focus results in no-slip grasps. A specific single-power
        grasp, using a specific manipulator, is examined in order to show that joint
        torque limits also effect focus placement. The results show that optimal focus
        location is grasp-specific, and that torque direction also plays a role in

        during the \u201cTraining School on qualitative theory of dynamical systems,
        tools and applications\u201d held at the University of Urbino (Italy) from
        17 September to 19 September 2015 in the framework of the European COST Action
        \u201cThe EU in the new complex geography of economic systems: models, tools
        and policy evaluation\u201d (Gecomplexity). Gecomplexity is a European research
        network, inspired by the New Economic Geography approach, initiated by P.
        Krugman in the early 1990s, which describes economic systems as multilayered
        and interconnected spatial structures. At each layer, different types of decisions
        and interactions are considered: interactions between international or regional
        trading partners at the macrolevel; the functioning of (financial, labour,
        goods) markets as social network structures at mesolevel; and finally, the
        location choices of single firms at the microlevel. Within these structures,
        spatial inequalities are evolving through time following complex patterns
        determined by economic, geographical, institutional and social factors. In
        order to study these structures, the Action aims to build an interdisciplinary
        approach to develop advanced mathematical and computational methods and tools
        for analysing complex nonlinear systems, ranging from social networks to game
        theoretical models, with the formalism of the qualitative theory of dynamical
        systems and the related concepts of attractors, stability, basins of attraction,
        local and global bifurcations. Following the same spirit, this book should
        provide an introduction to the study of dynamic models in economics and social
        sciences, both in discrete and in continuous time, by the methods of the qualitative
        theory of dynamical systems. At the same time, the students should also practice
        (and, hopefully, appreciate) the interdisciplinary \u201cart of mathematical
        modelling\u201d of real-world systems and time-evolving processes. Indeed,
        the set-up of a dynamic model of a real evolving system (physical, biological,
        social, economic, etc.) starts from a rigorous and critical analysis of the
        system, its main features and basic principles. Measurable quantities (i.e.
        quantities that can be expressed by numbers) that characterize its state and
        its behaviour must be identified in order to describe the system", "venue":

        projections from the cortex of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES) were
        demonstrated in the cat using the axonal transport methods of autoradiography
        and horseradish peroxidase. The corticotectal projection arises nearly exclusively
        from medium-large pyramidal cells in lamina V. One of the densest projecting
        areas of the AES is the rostral aspect of its superior bank, where a fourth
        somatotopic representation (SIV) has recently been demonstrated. It terminates
        in the intermediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus, where somatic
        cells are located. The pathway is bilateral but much heavier ipsilaterally
        than contralaterally. In contrast to the substantial corticotectal projection
        from SIV and adjacent tissue, there was no unequivocal evidence for a corticotectal
        projection from traditional somatosensory cortex SI-SIII. This finding, that
        somatosensory projections to the cat superior colliculus arise from an area
        outside of SI-SIII, was unexpected on the basis of what is known about visual
        corticotectal projections. However, it is consistent with the patterns of
        other cortical projections that terminate in the intermediate and deep laminae
        of this structure and with the absence of demonstrable corticotectal influences
        from SI to SIII in this animal. These data are in contrast to demonstrations
        by other investigators that there is a corticotectal projection from SI cortex
        in rodents. Apparently there is a fundamental species difference in the organization
        of descending somatosensory pathways. A corticothalamic projection of the
        AES was also observed. This descending projection appeared to form a shell
        of labeled cells and fibers around the ventrobasal complex, but unequivocal
        terminal labeling within the ventrobasal complex could not be demonstrated.
        Dense terminal labeling was apparent in the posterior group of thalamic nuclei
        (PO) where thalamocortical afferents to the AES originate.", "venue": "Journal

        labeled with horseradish peroxidase in the monkey, cat, and rat", "abstract":
        "The location of neurons in the substantia nigra''s pars reticulata (SNR)
        that send their axons to the superior colliculus was compared in the monkey,
        cat, and rat using the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) retrograde cell-labeling
        method. Although several cases of large, unilateral HRP deposits in the superior
        colliculus show that in all three species, the nigrotectal cells are confined,
        for the most part, to the rostral one- half of SNR, the following differences
        were noted in the precise location of the nigrotectal neurons and in the degree
        of bilaterality of the nigrotectal projection. In the monkey, labeled nigrotectal
        cells were particularly numerous in the extreme rostrolateral portion of SNR.
        From this region of high concentration, a progressively decreasing number
        of cells spreads medially in a ventral stratum immediately dorsal to the pes
        pedunculi. No labeled cells were found in the extreme medial part of SNR.
        A substantial number of HRP-positive cells were present in the contralateral
        SNR in a similar distribution. In the cat, labeled cells were less selectively
        localized in SNR''s mediolateral expanse, being distributed more or less randomly
        in its middle portion with a scattering of cells in both medial and lateral
        parts of SNR. Although some cell labeling occurred in the contralateral SNR,
        it was less substantial than in the monkey. In the rat, the HRP-positive cells
        were especially concentrated throughout the mediolateral extent of a ventral
        stratum of SNR immediately dorsal to the pes pedunculi. Although some cells
        were located more dorsally, they were far fewer in number and consistently
        less heavily labeled. Only one or two labeled cells could be detected in the
        contralateral SNR of the rat. These anatomical differences suggest that the
        influence of the corpus striatum on the tectal control of orienting responses
        may vary considerably from one mammalian species to the next.", "venue": "Journal

        ascending projections of the cuneiform nucleus in the cat were traced by autoradiography
        in the transverse and sagittal planes following stereotaxically placed injections
        of 3H\u2010leucine. The ascending fibers are almost exclusively ipsilateral
        and enter the diencephalon as a wide radiation. At the mesodiencephalic junction
        fibers enter the nucleus of the posterior commissure and pretectal nuclei,
        and others cross in the posterior commissure to distribute to these structures
        on the contralateral side. More ventrally directed fibers distribute to the
        fields of Forel and then spread into the posterior hypothalamus and zona incerta.
        At the caudal level of the ventral thalamic group, the ascending fibers diverge
        and follow two separate courses. One division of fibers continues forward
        beneath the ventral thalamic group and distributes to the zona incerta and
        dorsal hypothalamic area. It rapidly diminishes in size as it attains more
        rostral levels where it is found in the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis
        and the anterior commissure. Other fibers of this division spread laterally
        to innervate the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the lateral hypothalamus,
        and preoptic area, and still others follow the entire conformation of the
        thalamic reticular nucleus. The second division of fibers ascends through
        midline and intralaminar nuclei, completely encircling the mediodorsal nucleus,
        which is uninnervated except for a small ventral region. The distribution
        of this division is heaviest to the paraventricular, parafascicular, and central
        dorsal nuclei. Neither division is conspicuous rostral to the anterior commissure.

        descending projections of nucleus cuneiformis in the cat were traced by autoradiography
        in the transverse and sagittal planes following stereotaxically placed injections
        of 3H\u2010leucine. Many descending axons are organized into distinct fiber
        systems, of which the largest and most well\u2010defined crosses directly
        in the midbrain and descends through the ventromedial tegmentum of the brain
        stem. This fiber system first terminates profusely in n. reticularis tegmenti
        pontis and then proceeds through the rhombencephalic tegmentum emitting transversely
        oriented branches to n. reticularis pontis caudalis and gigantocellularis,
        the raphe magnus and the facial nucleus. Its most caudal field of termination
        is a restricted portion of the medial accessory olive. Because of its size,
        compactness, and ventromedial course, this fiber system was termed the ventral
        tegmental bundle. In contrast, fibers descending on the ipsilateral side are
        more loosely organized and describe many divergent paths. In their initial
        course they remain in a dorsolateral position and distribute to the n. locus
        coeruleus, n. raphe dorsalis, the central gray matter, and n. reticularis
        pontis oralis. At successively more caudal levels they converge ventromedially
        and descend through the rhombencephalic tegmentum in a position similar to
        that of the ventral tegmental bundle. At the level of the facial nucleus a
        group of fibers splits off to form a separate fiber bundle which descends
        lateral to the inferior olive and distributes to the lateral reticular nucleus.
        No evidence was found of projections to the spinal cord or cerebellum. A portion
        of the tegmentum ventromedial to nucleus cuneiformis was found to project
        bilaterally to the facial nucleus and to the ipsilateral medial accessory
        olive. The results of this study are discussed in relation to the role of
        the midbrain reticular formation in the elaboration of certain forms of behavior.",

        "abstract": "While emotion can be a subjective experience and emotions are
        revealed to some extent by facial expressions and changes of respiration,
        heart rate and other autonomic states, behavior itself is a primary indicator
        of emotions. The present work deals with a form of emotional behavior, specifically
        attack, which is one component of fighting. Since the work of Cannon, it has
        been acknowledged that sympathetically and hormonally mediated changes occur
        that prepare the organism for fight and flight. It is the thesis of this article
        that sensory and motor systems are similarly readied to act in specific ways
        under the influence of electrical stimulation of the brain that induces attack
        behavior. \n \n \n \nSpecifically electrical stimulation of the hypothalamus
        that elicits attack influences the visual system. This is shown by the difference
        between the frequency of lunges directed towards a mouse when it is presented
        to the eye ipsilateral and to that contralateral to the side of the hypothalamus
        stimulated. The contralateral eye mediates more lunges. The visual system
        is also gated by hypothalamic stimulation. A bite ensues in some instances
        after section of the trigeminal nerve, but not in others. After the successful
        cats are blindfolded they no longer bite. The tactile system around the mouth
        and lips is also influenced by hypothalamic stimulation. A more extensive
        region around the mouth and lip on the contralateral side than on the ipsilateral
        side responds to touch by eliciting head turning and jaw opening. The motor
        system for jaw closure and for striking are similarly influenced by hypothalamic
        stimulation. Reflexes become functional under the influence of stimulation.
        \n \n \n \nIn the case of attack behavior, the organism''s sensory and motor
        systems are primed to bring about patterned reflexes, which constitute at
        least in part the overt behavior when suitable stimuli are present in the
        environment.", "venue": "Behavioral Science", "year": 1971, "referenceCount":

        different vascular flow routes.", "abstract": "The vasoconstrictors, norepinephrine
        at low dose ( < or = 0.1 microM; LDNE) and serotonin (5-HT), produce opposing
        metabolic effects in the constant-flow perfused rat hindlimb characterized
        by increased and decreased oxygen uptake, respectively. In the present study,
        the effects of each vasoconstrictor are compared in the red blood cell-free
        buffer-perfused hindlimb on postequilibration endogenous red blood cell efflux,
        vascular entrapment of fluorescein-labeled dextran (Fx), and vascular corrosion
        casting by use of 30-micron spheres of methyl methacrylate (MM). A marked
        transient washout of red blood cells occurred immediately in association with
        vasoconstriction induced by LDNE that was not apparent when a similar extent
        of vasoconstriction was induced by 5-HT. Fx perfusions indicated that LDNE
        recruited a new vascular space that was reaccessed by a second exposure to
        the vasoconstrictor. 5-HT closed off a previously perfused vascular space
        that was reaccessed when the vasoconstrictor was removed. Corrosion casting
        of the arterial tree with MM showed no increase in cast weight, but more vessels
        filled because of LDNE. Higher doses of NE (2.5 microM) or 5-HT caused a marked
        decrease in cast weight with fewer vessels filled. The data suggest that LDNE
        and 5-HT, in association with vasoconstriction at different sites, control
        different capillary flow routes in the hindlimb that in turn may influence
        metabolism by increasing or decreasing nutrient access, respectively.", "venue":

        (Bettongia gaimardi) is a small marsupial rat kangaroo without detectable
        brown adipose tissue (BAT). The hindlimb was perfused with constant flow at
        25 degrees C after cannulation under anesthesia of the femoral artery and
        vein to one hindlimb. Norepinephrine (NE, 25 nM-2.5 microM) and vasopressin
        (VP, 10 nM-0.1 microM) each increased perfusion pressure, oxygen consumption
        (VO2), and lactate and glycerol efflux of the perfused hindlimb. NE-mediated
        increases in VO2 and the efflux of lactate and glycerol were unaffected by
        propranolol (10 microM) but were completely blocked by the further addition
        of phentolamine (10 microM). In contrast, serotonin (5-HT; 0.1-2.5 microM)
        inhibited VO2 and inhibited lactate efflux. The changes induced by NE, VP,
        and 5-HT were all rapidly reversed by nitroprusside. These results suggest
        that resting thermogenesis in bettong hindlimb can be differentially controlled
        by the vasculature, which may also contribute to the induced VO2. This vascular
        control of skeletal muscle VO2 appears widespread in homeotherm evolution.",

        heart.", "abstract": "The characteristics of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors
        were investigated in perfused rat hearts at 37 degrees C. [3H]Prazosin was
        bound in a time-dependent manner and reached equilibrium at 15 min. Scatchard
        analysis of the specific binding isotherm for [3H]prazosin indicated a population
        of high affinity sites (Kd = 0.41 nM, Bmax = 13.2 pmol/g wet wt). Prazosin
        binding was displaced by epinephrine as well as by the adrenergic antagonists
        prazosin greater than phentolamine greater than yohimbine greater than propranolol.
        Specific prazosin binding was defined as that portion of the binding inhibited
        by 10 microM phentolamine; phentolamine and epinephrine displaced 3H-prazosin
        to the same level. [3H]Prazosin was not metabolized by the heart. When pre-labelled
        hearts were perfused at 37 degrees C with prazosin-free medium non-specific
        binding of [3H]prazosin decreased more rapidly (t0.5 = 4 min) than specific
        binding (t0.5 = 38 min). Perfusion of the heart at lower temperatures (less
        than 10 degrees C) decreased the rate of loss of nonspecific binding and prevented
        the loss of specific binding. Fractionation of [3H]prazosin perfused hearts
        at 0 degrees C, when dissociation was minimal, led to a loss of binding so
        that sarcolemma-enriched fractions contained approximately 2% of the binding
        sites present in the perfused heart. The binding characteristics of sarcolemma-enriched
        fractions (Kd 0.10 nM, Bmax 300 fmol/mg protein) differed significantly from
        those of the perfused heart. Exposure of the heart to 10 min of ischaemia
        prior to binding studies did not alter the characteristics of the [3H]prazosin
        binding sites. It is concluded that the perfused rat heart contains a population
        of alpha 1-adrenoceptors which differ from those of isolated sarcolemma preparations
        perhaps because of alterations that occur during sarcolemma isolation. The
        perfused heart should be an appropriate model system in which to study the
        relationship between receptor occupancy and biological response as well as
        the direct effects of perturbations such as ischaemia.", "venue": "Journal

        on 2-deoxyglucose uptake and phosphorylation in perfused rat heart.", "abstract":
        "Insulin (0.1 microM) and 1 microM epinephrine each increased the uptake and
        phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose by the perfused rat heart by increasing
        the apparent Vmax without altering the Km. Isoproterenol (10 microM), 50 microM
        methoxamine and 10 mM CaCl2 also increased uptake. Lowering of the perfusate
        Ca2+ concentration from 1.27 to 0.1 mM Ca2+, addition of the Ca2+ channel
        blocker nifedipine (1 microM) or addition of 1.7 mM EGTA decreased the basal
        rate of uptake of 2-deoxyglucose and prevented the stimulation due to 1 microM
        epinephrine. Stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by 0.1 microM insulin was
        only partly inhibited by Ca2+ omission, nifedipine or 1 mM EGTA. Half-maximal
        stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by insulin occurred at 2 nM and 0.4 nM
        for medium containing 1.27 and 0.1 mM Ca2+, respectively. Maximal concentrations
        of insulin (0.1 microM) and epinephrine (1 microM) were additive for glucose
        uptake and lactate output but were not additive for uptake of 2-deoxyglucose.
        Half-maximal stimulation of 2-deoxyglucose uptake by epinephrine occurred
        at 0.2 microM but maximal concentrations of epinephrine (e.g., 1 microM) gave
        lower rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake than that attained by maximal concentrations
        of insulin. The addition of insulin increased uptake of 2-deoxyglucose at
        all concentrations of epinephrine but epinephrine only increased uptake at
        sub-maximal concentrations of insulin. The role of Ca2+ in signal reversal
        was also studied. Removal of 1 microM epinephrine after a 10 min exposure
        period resulted in a rapid return of contractility to basal values but the
        rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake increased further and remained elevated at 20
        min unless the Ca2+ concentration was lowered to 0.1 mM or nifedipine (1 microM)
        was added. Similarly, removal of 0.1 microM insulin after a 10 min exposure
        period did not affect the rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake, which did not return
        to basal values within 20 min unless the concentration of Ca2+ was decreased
        to 0.1 mM. Insulin-mediated increase in 2-deoxyglucose uptake at 0.1 mM Ca2+
        reversed upon hormone removal. It is concluded that catecholamines mediate
        a Ca2+-dependent increase in 2-deoxyglucose transport from either alpha or
        beta receptors. Insulin has both a Ca2+-dependent and a Ca2+-independent component.
        Reversal studies suggest an additional role for Ca2+ in maintaining the activated
        transport state when activated by either epinephrine or insulin.", "venue":

        "Sarcolemma-enriched preparations from muscles rich in slow oxidative red
        fibres contained specific binding sites for the alpha 1 antagonist, prazosin
        (e.g. soleus Kd 0.13 nM, Bmax 29 fmol/mg protein). Binding sites for prazosin
        were almost absent from white muscle. Displacement of prazosin binding from
        sarcolemma of soleus muscle (phentolamine greater than phenylephrine greater
        than idazoxan greater than yohimbine) suggested that the receptors were alpha
        1. Binding sites for dihydroalprenolol (beta antagonist) were also more concentrated
        on red than white muscle and outnumbered prazosin sites by approx. 10:1. Binding
        sites for idazoxan (alpha 2 antagonist) were undetectable. Contamination of
        sarcolemma-enriched preparations by endothelial tissue indicated by the activity
        of angiotensin converting enzyme did not correlate with prazosin binding.

        "abstract": "The selenium nutrition of sheep throughout Victoria was assessed
        by a survey of the blood glutathione peroxidase activity in 708 flocks. It
        was shown that the blood glutathione peroxidase activity in sheep had a seasonal
        variation with lowest levels in the spring. The enzyme activity was correlated
        with the blood selenium concentration. Areas where blood selenium was less
        than 0.03 micrograms/ml in spring were defined. Sheep with low selenium nutrition
        were grazing pastures in the high rainfall areas on acid soils, particularly
        those derived from granite. Selenium concentrations in pasture samples examined
        were greater than 0.02 mg/kg, and it was found that superphosphate application
        had no significant effect on the selenium content of pasture. However, management
        practices such as high stocking rates and rates of application of superphosphate
        to pasture were associated with low blood glutathione peroxidase activities
        in sheep. It was concluded that the selenium nutrition of most of the sheep
        flocks in Victoria is adequate, and that the deficient areas are localised.
        There seems little requirement for supplementation of adult sheep. As the
        delayed type of white muscle disease in spring lambs appears to be the main
        selenium-responsive disorder, direct supplementation of lambs in the low selenium
        areas would be the most effective method of ensuring adequate selenium nutrition.",

        dystrophy and selenium nutrition.", "abstract": "The activity of glutathione
        peroxidase, a selenium containing enzyme, was measured in the blood of horses
        to determine its usefulness as an indicator of selenium status. In 15 horses
        the enzyme activity was positively related to the blood selenium concentration
        (P less than .001, r-0.98) over the range of enzyme activities of 8.2 to 140
        units (mumoles NADP-oxidised/min/gHb) and selenium concentrations of 0.24
        to 2.74 mumol/l. In a group of 8 horses which 2 foals had died with lesions
        of muscular dystrophy the enzyme activity increased from a mean of 11.8 units
        before treatment with selenium to 34.5 units after 2 intravenous injections
        of sodium selenite given one month apart. Another group of 8 horses grazing
        paddocks adjacent to this affected group did not receive any selenium treatment
        and had a mean enzyme activity of 11.9 units. Blood glutathione peroxidase
        activity was measured in 50 pasture-fed horses and 180 stall-fed horses. The
        range of activities found (7 to 158 units) indicated that selenium intake
        in horses varied widely between localities. All pasture-fed horses grazing
        areas where muscular dystrophy had occurred in foals had low activities (less
        than 20 units). In stall-fed horses the enzyme activity was influenced by
        selenium treatment, and horses which had been treated usually had higher activities
        than horses in the same stable with no history of selenium treatment. It was
        concluded that blood glutathione peroxidase is a suitable indicator of selenium
        status in horses.", "venue": "Australian Veterinary Journal", "year": 1978,

        \u03b12-adrenergic receptors (\u03b12ARs) are localized to and function on
        the basolateral surface in polarized renal epithelial cells via a mechanism
        involving the third cytoplasmic loop. To identify proteins that may contribute
        to this retention, [35S]Met-labeled Gen10 fusion proteins with the 3i loops
        of the \u03b12AAR (Val217\u2013Ala377), \u03b12BAR (Lys210\u2013Trp354), and
        \u03b12CAR (Arg248\u2013Val363) were used as ligands in gel overlay assays.
        A protein doublet of \u223c30 kDa in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells or pig
        brain cytosol (\u03b12B \u2265 \u03b12C\u226b \u03b12A) was identified. The
        interacting protein was purified by sequential DEAE and size exclusion chromatography,
        and subsequent microsequencing revealed that they are the \u03b6 isoform of
        14-3-3 proteins. [35S]Met-14-3-3\u03b6 binds to all three native \u03b12AR
        subtypes, assessed using a solid phase binding assay (\u03b12A\u2265\u03b12B>
        \u03b12C), and this binding depends on the presence of the 3i loops. Attenuation
        of the \u03b12AR-14-3-3 interactions in the presence of a phosphorylated Raf-1
        peptide corresponding to its 14-3-3 interacting domain (residues 251\u2013266),
        but not by its non-phosphorylated counterpart, provides evidence for the functional
        specificity of these interactions and suggests one potential interface for
        the \u03b12AR and 14-3-3 interactions. These studies represent the first evidence
        for G protein-coupled receptor interactions with 14-3-3 proteins and may provide
        a mechanism for receptor localization and/or coordination of signal transduction.",

        using test-driven development on assignments is one way to help students learn.
        We use a flexible automated grading system called Web-CAT to assess student
        assignments, including the validity and completeness of their own test cases.
        By building on existing educational plug-ins for Eclipse, and adding our own
        plug-ins for electronic submission and for unit testing support in C++, we
        are able to use Eclipse as a portal to all the services our students will
        need, allowing them to accomplish all their tasks entirely within the IDE,
        from their project''s inception to its submission and evaluation. Further,
        we are able to carry students through the transition from Java programming
        to C++ programming within this same environment.", "venue": "eclipse ''05",

        "title": "Improving skills and care standards in the support workforce for
        older people: a realist synthesis of workforce development interventions",
        "abstract": "Objectives This evidence review was conducted to understand how
        and why workforce development interventions can improve the skills and care
        standards of support workers in older people''s services. Design Following
        recognised realist synthesis principles, the review was completed by (1) development
        of an initial programme theory; (2) retrieval, review and synthesis of evidence
        relating to interventions designed to develop the support workforce; (3) \u2018testing
        out\u2019 the synthesis findings to refine the programme theories, and establish
        their practical relevance/potential for implementation through stakeholder
        interviews; and (4) forming actionable recommendations. Participants Stakeholders
        who represented services, commissioners and older people were involved in
        workshops in an advisory capacity, and 10 participants were interviewed during
        the theory refinement process. Results Eight context\u2013mechanism\u2013outcome
        (CMO) configurations were identified which cumulatively comprise a new programme
        theory about \u2018what works\u2019 to support workforce development in older
        people''s services. The CMOs indicate that the design and delivery of workforce
        development includes how to make it real to the work of those delivering support
        to older people; the individual support worker''s personal starting points
        and expectations of the role; how to tap into support workers'' motivations;
        the use of incentivisation; joining things up around workforce development;
        getting the right mix of people engaged in the design and delivery of workforce
        development programmes/interventions; taking a planned approach to workforce
        development, and the ways in which components of interventions reinforce one
        another, increasing the potential for impacts to embed and spread across organisations.
        Conclusions It is important to take a tailored approach to the design and
        delivery of workforce development that is mindful of the needs of older people,
        support workers, health and social care services and the employing organisations
        within which workforce development operates. Workforce development interventions
        need to balance the technical, professional and emotional aspects of care.

        realist synthesis of workforce development interventions", "abstract": "Purpose:
        The purpose of this presentation is to share the findings from a research
        study funded by the National Institute for Health Research Services and Delivery
        Research Programme. Support workers make up the majority of the workforce
        in health and social care services for older people. There is evidence to
        suggest that support workers are not deployed as effectively as possible,
        are often undervalued, and there are gaps in understanding support worker
        roles across different care settings. The review was designed to answer the
        question: how can workforce development interventions improve the skills and
        the care standards of support workers within older people\u2019s health and
        social care services? Design: The review was conducted in four iterative stages
        over 18 months:(1) development of a theoretical framework and initial programme
        theory; (2) retrieval, review and synthesise evidence relating to interventions
        designed to develop the support workforce guided by the programme theories;
        (3) \u2018testing out\u2019 the synthesis findings to refine the programme
        theories, and establish their practical relevance/potential for implementation,
        and (4) forming recommendations about how to improve current workforce development
        interventions to ensure high standards in the care of older people. Findings:
        Eight CMO configurations emerged from the review process, which provide a
        programme theory about \u2018what works\u2019 in developing the older person\u2019s
        support workforce. The findings indicate that the design and delivery of workforce
        development should consider and include a number of starting points, specifically;
        personal factors about the support worker; the specific requirements of workforce
        development, and the fit with broader organisational strategy and goals. Conclusions:
        The review has resulted in an explanatory account of how the design and delivery
        of workforce development interventions work to improve the skills and care
        standards of support workers within older people\u2019s health and social
        care services. Contribution: Whilst the theory is specific to our synthesis
        context of workforce development, we believe the context-mechanism and outcome
        explanations are sufficiently abstract to be transferable across workforce
        development in the public services in general.", "venue": "", "year": 2015,

        "abstract": "Global efforts to deliver internationally agreed goals to reduce
        carbon emissions, halt biodiversity loss, and retain essential ecosystem services
        have been poorly integrated. These goals rely in part on preserving natural
        (e.g., native, largely unmodified) and seminatural (e.g., low intensity or
        sustainable human use) forests, woodlands, and grasslands. To show how to
        unify these goals, we empirically derived spatially explicit, quantitative,
        area\u2010based targets for the retention of natural and seminatural (e.g.,
        native) terrestrial vegetation worldwide. We used a 250\u2010m\u2010resolution
        map of natural and seminatural vegetation cover and, from this, selected areas
        identified under different international agreements as being important for
        achieving global biodiversity, carbon, soil, and water targets. At least 67
        million km2 of Earth''s terrestrial vegetation (\u223c79% of the area of vegetation
        remaining) required retention to contribute to biodiversity, climate, soil,
        and freshwater conservation objectives under 4 United Nations\u2019 resolutions.
        This equates to retaining natural and seminatural vegetation across at least
        50% of the total terrestrial (excluding Antarctica) surface of Earth. Retention
        efforts could contribute to multiple goals simultaneously, especially where
        natural and seminatural vegetation can be managed to achieve cobenefits for
        biodiversity, carbon storage, and ecosystem service provision. Such management
        can and should co\u2010occur and be driven by people who live in and rely
        on places where natural and sustainably managed vegetation remains in situ
        and must be complemented by restoration and appropriate management of more
        human\u2010modified environments if global goals are to be realized.", "venue":

        loss of the natural systems upon which we, and all life, rely. To date, global
        efforts to achieve internationally-agreed goals to reduce carbon emissions,
        halt biodiversity loss, and retain essential ecosystem services, have been
        poorly integrated. However, these different goals all rely on preserving natural
        ecosystems. Here, we show how to unify these goals by empirically deriving
        spatially-explicit, quantitative area-based targets for the retention of natural
        terrestrial ecosystems. We found that at least 67 million km2 of Earth\u2019s
        natural terrestrial ecosystems (~79% of the area remaining) require retention
        \u2013 via a combination of strict protection but more prominently through
        sustainably managed land use regimes complemented by restoration actions \u2013
        to contribute to biodiversity, climate, soil and freshwater objectives under
        four United Nations\u2019 Resolutions. This equates to retaining natural ecosystems
        across ~50% of the total terrestrial (excluding Antarctica) surface of Earth.
        Our results show where retention efforts could be focussed to contribute to
        multiple goals simultaneously. The retention targets concept that we present
        explicitly recognises that such management can and should co-occur alongside
        and be driven by the people who live in and rely on places where natural and
        semi-natural ecosystems remain on Earth.", "venue": "bioRxiv", "year": 2021,

        arising from development projects (e.g., infrastructure, resource extraction,
        urban expansion) are frequently addressed through biodiversity offsetting.
        As currently implemented, offsetting typically requires an outcome of \u201cno
        net loss\u201d of biodiversity, but only relative to a baseline trajectory
        of biodiversity decline. This type of \u201crelative\u201d no net loss entrenches
        ongoing biodiversity loss, and is misaligned with biodiversity targets that
        require \u201cabsolute\u201d no net loss or \u201cnet gain.\u201d Here, we
        review the limitations of biodiversity offsetting, and in response, propose
        a new framework for compensating for biodiversity losses from development
        in a way that is aligned explicitly with jurisdictional biodiversity targets.
        In the framework, targets for particular biodiversity features are achieved
        via one of three pathways: Net Gain, No Net Loss, or (rarely) Managed Net
        Loss. We outline how to set the type (\u201cMaintenance\u201d or \u201cImprovement\u201d)
        and amount of ecological compensation that is appropriate for proportionately
        contributing to the achievement of different targets. This framework advances
        ecological compensation beyond a reactive, ad\u2010hoc response, to ensuring

        "abstract": "Introduction\nThe Adverse Outcome Pathway framework is increasingly
        used to integrate data generated based on traditional and emerging toxicity
        testing paradigms. As the number of AOP descriptions has increased, so has
        the need to define the AOP in computable terms.\n\n\nMaterials and Methods\nHerein,
        we present a comprehensive annotation of 172 AOPs housed in the AOP-Wiki as
        of December 4, 2016 using terms from existing biological ontologies.\n\n\nResults\nAOP
        Key Events (KEs) were assigned ontology terms using a concept called the Event
        Component, which consists of a Process, an Object, and an Action term, with
        each term originating from ontologies and other controlled vocabularies. Annotation
        of KEs with ontology classes from fourteen ontologies and controlled vocabularies
        resulted in a total of 685 KEs being annotated with a total of 809 Event Components.
        A set of seven conventions resulted, defining the annotation of KEs via Event
        Components.\n\n\nDiscussion\nThis expanded annotation of AOPs allows computational
        reasoners to aid in both AOP development and applications. In addition, the
        incorporation of explicit biological objects will reduce the time required
        for converting a qualitative AOP description into a conceptual model that
        can support computational modeling. As high throughput genomics becomes a
        more important part of the high throughput toxicity testing landscape, the
        new approaches described here for annotating key events will also promote
        the visualization and analysis of genomics data in an AOP context.", "venue":

        "abstract": "PURPOSE\nAccording to TG-40 percent-depth-dose (PDD) tolerance
        is \u00b12% but TG-142 is \u00b11%. Now the question is, which one is relevant
        in IMRT era? The primary objective of this study is to evaluate dosimetric
        impact of beam-energy-drifts on IMRT-delivery.\n\n\nMETHODS\nBeam-energy drifts
        were simulated by adjusting Linac''s bending-magnet-current (BMC) followed
        by tuning the pulse-forming network and adjusting gun-current. PDD change
        of -0.6% and +1.2% were tested. Planar-dosimetry measurements were performed
        using an ionization-chamber-array in solid-water phantoms. Study includes
        10-head-and-neck and 3-breast cancer patients. en-face beam-deliveries were
        also tested at 1.3cm and 5.3cm depths. Composite and single-field dose-distributions
        were compared against the plans to determine %Gamma pass-rates (%GPRs). For
        plan dose comparisons, changes in %Gamma pass-rates (cPGPRs) were computed/reported
        to exclude the differences between dose-computation and delivery. Dose distributions
        of the drifted-energies were compared against their baseline measurements
        to determine the% GPRs. A Gamma criteria of 3%/3mm was considered for plan-dose
        comparisons while 3%/1mm used for measured dose intercomparisons.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor
        composite-dose delivery, average cPGPRs were 0.41%\u00b12.48% and -2.54%\u00b13.65%
        for low-energy (LE) and high-energy (HE) drifts, respectively. For measured
        dose inter-comparisons, the average%GPRs were 98.4%\u00b12.2% (LE-drift) and
        95.8%\u00b14.0 (HE-drift). The average %GPR of 92.6%\u00b14.3% was noted for
        the worst-case scenario comparing LE-drift to HE-drift. All en-face beams
        at 5.3 cm depth have cPGPRs within \u00b14% of the baseline-energy measurements.
        However, greater variations were noted for 1.3cm depth. Average %GPRs for
        drifted energies were >99% at 5.3cm and >97% at 1.3cm depths. However, for
        the worst-case scenario (LE-drift to HE-drift) these numbers dropped to 95.2%
        at 5.3cm and 93.1% at 1.3cm depths.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe dosimetric impact
        of beam-energy drifts was found to be within clinically acceptable tolerance.
        However, this study includes a single energy with limited range of PDD change.

        staff and members of the public is of paramount importance, particularly in
        occupied areas adjacent to computed tomography scanner suites. Increased patient
        workloads and the adoption of multi-slice scanning systems may make unshielded
        secondary scatter from ceiling surfaces a significant contributor to dose.
        The present paper expands upon an existing analytical model for calculating
        ceiling scatter accounting for variable room geometries and provides calibration
        data for a range of clinical beam qualities. The practical effect of gantry,
        false ceiling, and wall attenuation in limiting ceiling scatter is also explored
        and incorporated into the model. Monte Carlo simulations were used to calibrate
        the model for scatter from both concrete and lead surfaces. Gantry attenuation
        experimental data showed an effective blocking of scatter directed toward
        the ceiling at angles up to 20\u201330\u00b0 from the vertical for the scanners
        examined. The contribution of ceiling scatter from computed tomography operation
        to the effective dose of individuals in areas surrounding the scanner suite
        could be significant and therefore should be considered in shielding design
        according to the proposed analytical model.", "venue": "Health Physics", "year":

        image-guided spinal surgery: clinical article.", "abstract": "OBJECT\nSurgeon
        and operating room (OR) staff radiation exposure during spinal surgery is
        a concern, especially with the increasing use of multiplanar fluoroscopy in
        minimally invasive spinal surgery procedures. Cone beam computed tomography
        (cbCT)-based, 3D image guidance does not involve the use of active fluoroscopy
        during instrumentation placement and therefore decreases radiation exposure
        for the surgeon and OR staff during spinal fusion procedures. However, the
        radiation scatter of a cbCT device can be similar to that of a standard 64-slice
        CT scanner and thus could expose the surgeon and OR staff to radiation during
        image acquisition. The purpose of the present study was to measure radiation
        exposure at several unshielded locations in the OR when using cbCT in conjunction
        with 3D image-guided spinal surgery in 25 spinal surgery cases.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFive
        unshielded badge dosimeters were placed at set locations in the OR during
        25 spinal surgery cases in which cbCT-based, 3D image guidance was used. The
        cbCT device (O-ARM) was used in conjunction with the Stealth S7 image-guided
        platform. The radiology department analyzed the badge dosimeters after completion
        of the last case.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty high-definition O-ARM spins were performed
        in 25 patients for spinal registration and to check instrumentation placement.
        Image-guided placement of 124 screws from C-2 to the ileum was accomplished
        without complication. Badge dosimetry analysis revealed minimal radiation
        exposure for the badges 6 feet from the gantry in the area of the anesthesiology
        equipment, as well as for the badges located 10-13 feet from the gantry on
        each side of the room (mean 0.7-3.6 mrem/spin). The greatest radiation exposure
        occurred on the badge attached to the OR table within the gantry (mean 176.9
        mrem/spin), as well as on the control panel adjacent to the gantry (mean 128.0
        mrem/spin).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRadiation scatter from the O-ARM was minimal
        at various distances outside of and not adjacent to the gantry. Although the
        average radiation exposure at these locations was low, an earlier study, undertaken
        in a similar fashion, revealed no radiation exposure when the surgeon stood
        behind a lead shield. This simple precaution can eliminate the small amount
        of radiation exposure to OR staff in cases in which the O-ARM is used.", "venue":

        of Radiation Dose for Chest Computed Radiography", "abstract": "Purpose: To
        investigate the effects of x\u2010ray exposure parameters and added beam filtration
        on patient dose and image quality for optimization of chest computed radiography(CR).
        Method and Materials: A chest x\u2010ray phantom (CardinalHealth Model 76\u2010211)
        was used to simulate a patient of standard size. To achieve a small or a large
        patient size, one sheet of 25\u2010mm acrylic was removed or added, respectively.
        Pre\u2010 and post\u2010patient x\u2010ray spectra were measured using a CdTe
        x\u2010ray spectrometer at various exposure conditions and added filters.
        kVp stations of 80, 100, and 120 were selected. An Al plate of 0, 1.0, 2.0,
        3.0 mm or a Cu plate of 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 mm was placed at the tube exit window
        for each exposure setting. Patient entrance exposure was measured using a
        Radcal ion chamber under automatic exposure control at each exposure condition.
        Corresponding CRimages were acquired at above conditions using a contrast\u2010detail
        phantom (CDRAD) placed between acrylic plates of the chest phantom for evaluating
        image quality. The same protocol for processing of CRimage plate was used
        throughout. Both printed films and digital images were archived. Reading sessions
        were conducted to interpret the 72 CRimages. Results: CDRAD images were ranked
        based on image quality. Corresponding patient dose and x\u2010ray spectrum
        were analyzed. Beam effective energy and spectrum information were evaluated.
        Optimal imaging condition was determined. In general, with increased beam
        filtration and effective energy, image quality decreased with dose saving
        as expected. However, at certain conditions of patient size, filtration, and
        kVp, image quality actually appeared improved with reduced or comparable patient
        dose. Conclusion: Proper use of pre\u2010patient filtration can improve CR
        chest image quality while maintaining or reducing patient dose at carefully
        selected kVp setting for a patient. Optional filters should be made available
        for digital chest radiography.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount":

        length in birds", "abstract": "A link between diet and avian intestinal anatomy
        is generally assumed. We collated the length of intestinal sections and body
        mass of 390 bird species and tested relationships with diet, climate and locomotion.
        There was a strong phylogenetic signal in all datasets. The total and small
        intestine scaled more-than-geometrically (95%CI of the scaling exponent >
        0.33). The traditional dietary classification (faunivore, omnivore and herbivore)
        had no significant effect on total intestine (TI) length. Significant dietary
        proxies included %folivory, %frugi-nectarivory and categories (frugi-nectarivory,
        granivory, folivory, omnivory, insectivory and vertivory). Individual intestinal
        sections were affected by different dietary proxies. The best model indicates
        that higher consumption of fruit and nectar, drier habitats, and a high degree
        of flightedness are linked to shorter TI length. Notably, the length of the
        avian intestine depends on other biological factors as much as on diet. Given

        lend themselves to narratives of flexibility (morphology is not destiny) rather

        of this study was to investigate the effect of dietary fatty acid (FA) composition
        on bile acid (BA) metabolism in a pig model of NAFLD, by using a multiomics
        approach combined with histology and serum biochemistry. Thirty 20-d-old Iberian
        pigs pair-housed in pens were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 hypercaloric
        diets for 10 weeks: 1) lard-enriched (LAR; n=5 pens), 2) olive oil-enriched
        (OLI, n=5), and 3) coconut oil-enriched (COC; n=5). Animals were euthanized
        on week 10 after blood sampling, and liver, colon and distal ileum (DI) were
        collected for histology, metabolomics, and transcriptomics. Data were analyzed
        by multivariate and univariate statistics. Compared with OLI and LAR, COC
        increased primary and secondary BAs in liver, plasma and colon. In addition,
        both COC and OLI reduced circulating fibroblast growth factor 19, increased
        hepatic necrosis, composite lesion score, and liver enzymes in serum, and
        upregulated genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation and DNA repair. The
        severity of liver disease in COC and OLI pigs was associated with increased
        levels of phosphatidylcholines, medium-chain triacylglycerides, trimethylamine-N-oxide,

        markers in DI, but not with changes in the composition or size of BA pool.
        In conclusion, our results indicate a role of dietary FAs in the regulation
        of BA metabolism and progression of NAFLD. Interventions that aim to modify

        "title": "Mammalian intestinal allometry, phylogeny, trophic level and climate",
        "abstract": "An often-stated ecomorphological assumption that has the status
        of \u2018textbook knowledge\u2019 is that the dimensions of the digestive
        tract correlate with diet, where herbivores\u2014consuming diets of lower
        digestibility\u2014have longer intestinal tracts than faunivores\u2014consuming
        diets of higher digestibility. However, statistical approaches have so far
        failed to demonstrate this link. Here, we collated data on the length of intestinal
        sections and body mass of 519 mammal species, and test for various relationships
        with trophic, climatic and other biological characteristics. All models showed
        a strong phylogenetic signal. Scaling relationships with body mass showed
        positive allometry at exponents greater than 0.33, except for the caecum,
        which is particularly large in smaller species. Body mass was more tightly
        linked to small intestine than to large intestine length. Adding a diet proxy
        to the relationships increased model fit for all intestinal sections, except
        for the small intestine when accounting for phylogeny. Thus, the diet has
        a main effect on the components of the large intestine, with longer measures
        in herbivores. Additionally, measures of habitat aridity had a positive relationship
        with large intestine length. The small intestine was longer in species from
        colder habitats at higher latitudes, possibly facilitating the processing
        of peak intake rates during the growing season. This study corroborates intuitive
        expectations on digestive tract anatomy, while the dependence of significant
        results on large sample sizes and inclusion of specific taxonomic groups indicates
        that the relationships cannot be considered fixed biological laws.", "venue":

        "title": "Less need for differentiation? Intestinal length of reptiles as
        compared to mammals", "abstract": "Although relationships between intestinal
        morphology between trophic groups in reptiles are widely assumed and represent
        a cornerstone of ecomorphological narratives, few comparative approaches actually
        tested this hypothesis on a larger scale. We collected data on lengths of
        intestinal sections of 205 reptile species for which either body mass (BM),
        snout-vent-length (SVL) or carapax length (CL) was recorded, transforming
        SVL or CL into BM if the latter was not given, and analyzed scaling patterns
        with BM and SVL, accounting for phylogeny, comparing three trophic guilds
        (faunivores, omnivores, herbivores), and comparing with a mammal dataset.
        Length-BM relationships in reptiles were stronger for the small than the large
        intestine, suggesting that for the latter, additional factors might be relevant.
        Adding trophic level did not consistently improve model fit; only when controlling
        for phylogeny, models indicated a longer large intestine in herbivores, due
        to a corresponding pattern in lizards. Trophic level effects were highly susceptible
        to sample sizes, and not considered strong. Models that linked BM to intestine
        length had better support than models using SVL, due to the deviating body
        shape of snakes. At comparable BM, reptiles had shorter intestines than mammals.
        While the latter finding corresponds to findings of lower tissue masses for
        the digestive tract and other organs in reptiles as well as our understanding
        of differences in energetic requirements between the classes, they raise the
        hitherto unanswered question what it is that reptiles of similar BM have more
        than mammals. A lesser effect of trophic level on intestine lengths in reptiles
        compared to mammals may stem from lesser selective pressures on differentiation
        between trophic guilds, related to the generally lower food intake and different
        movement patterns of reptiles, which may not similarly escalate evolutionary
        arms races tuned to optimal agility as between mammalian predators and prey.",

        Adiposity and Increased Triglyceridemia but Comparable NAFLD Severity in Juvenile
        Iberian Pigs.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nFructose consumption has been linked
        to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children. However, the effect
        of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) compared with sucrose in pediatric NAFLD
        has not been investigated.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nWe tested whether the isocaloric
        substitution of dietary sucrose by HFCS would increase the severity of NAFLD
        in juvenile pigs, and whether this effect would be associated with changes
        in gut histology, SCFA production, and microbial diversity.\n\n\nMETHODS\nIberian
        pigs, 53-d-old and pair-housed in pens balanced for weight and sex, were randomly
        assigned to receive a mash diet top-dressed with increasing amounts of sucrose
        (SUC; n\u00a0=\u00a03 pens; 281.6-486.8\u00a0g/kg diet) or HFCS (n\u00a0=\u00a04;
        444.3-724.8\u00a0g/kg diet) during 16 wk. Diets exceeded the animal''s energy
        requirements by providing sugars in excess, but met the requirements for all
        other nutrients. Animals were killed at 165 d of age after blood sampling,
        and liver, muscle, and gut were collected for histology, metabolome, and microbiome
        analyses. Data were analyzed by multivariate and univariate statistics.\n\n\nRESULTS\nCompared
        with SUC, HFCS increased subcutaneous fat, triacylglycerides in plasma, and
        butyrate in colon (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In addition, HFCS decreased UMP
        and short-chain acyl carnitines in liver, and urea nitrogen and creatinine
        in serum (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Microbiome analysis showed a 24.8% average
        dissimilarity between HFCS and SUC associated with changes in SCFA-producing
        bacteria. Body weight gain, intramuscular fat, histological and serum markers
        of liver injury, and circulating hormones, glucose, and proinflammatory cytokines
        did not differ between diets.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nFructose consumption derived
        from HFCS promoted butyrate synthesis, triglyceridemia, and subcutaneous lipid
        deposition in juvenile Iberian pigs, but did not increase serum and histological
        markers of NAFLD compared with a sucrose-enriched diet. Longer studies could
        be needed to observe differences in liver injury among sugar types.", "venue":

        of diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we fed a \"Western-style
        diet\" (HFF) enriched with fructose, cholesterol and saturated fat for 10
        weeks to juvenile Iberian pigs. We also supplemented probiotics with in vitro
        BA deconjugating activity to evaluate their potential therapeutic effect in
        NASH. Liver lipid and function, cytokines and hormones were analyzed using
        commercially available kits. Metabolites, BAs, and fatty acids were measured
        by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Histology and gene and protein
        expression analyses were performed using standard protocols. HFF-fed pigs
        developed NASH, cholestasis and impaired enterohepatic Farnesoid-X receptor
        (FXR)-Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) signaling, in the absence of obesity
        and insulin resistance. Choline depletion in HFF livers was associated with
        decreased lipoprotein and cholesterol in serum, and an increase of choline-containing
        phospholipids in colon contents and trimethylamine-N-oxide in the liver. Additionally,
        gut dysbiosis and hyperplasia increased with the severity of NASH, and were
        correlated with increased colonic levels of choline metabolites and secondary
        BAs. Supplementation of probiotics in the HFF diet enhanced NASH, inhibited
        hepatic autophagy, increased excretion of taurine and choline, and decreased
        gut microbial diversity. In conclusion, dysregulation of BA homeostasis was
        associated with injury and choline depletion in the liver, as well as increased
        biliary secretion, gut metabolism and excretion of choline-based phospholipids.
        Choline depletion limited lipoprotein synthesis resulting in hepatic steatosis,
        while secondary BAs and choline-containing phospholipids in colon may have
        promoted dysbiosis, hyperplasia and trimethylamine synthesis, causing further

        "title": "A Diet-Induced Pediatric Model of Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease
        Using Neonatal Iberian Pigs (OR26-02-19).", "abstract": "Objectives\nThe prevalence
        of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in children has increased over
        the past decades, creating a need for animal models that recapitulate the
        features of the pediatric disease. Iberian pigs have a leptin-resistant phenotype
        characterized by hyperleptinemia, hyperphagia, and extreme adipogenesis. We
        hypothesized that neonatal Iberian pigs fed a high-fat high-fructose (HFF)
        diet will develop a pattern of liver injury resembling pediatric NAFLD. In
        addition, we sought to determine if a mixture of probiotics would prevent
        the disease.\n\n\nMethods\nAnimals were fed 1 of 4 diets containing (g/kg
        body weight\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0d) 0 g fructose, 11 g fat and 199 kcal (CON-N;
        n\u00a0=\u00a08), 22 g fructose, 16 g fat and 300 kcal (HFF-N; n\u00a0=\u00a06),
        CON\u00a0+\u00a0probiotic (CON-P; n\u00a0=\u00a06), or HFF\u00a0+\u00a0probiotic
        (HFF-P; n\u00a0=\u00a06) every 6 h for 70 d. The probiotic mixture (6.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104cfu/mL)
        contained Pediococcus, Lactobacillus and Bacillus. Body weight was recorded
        every 3 d. Serum markers of liver injury and dyslipidemia were measured on
        d 65 at 2 h post feeding. Fasting leptin, insulin, glucose and homeostatic
        model assessment (HOMA) values were assessed on d 70. Liver tissue was collected
        on d 70 for histology, triacylglyceride (TG) quantification, and gene expression
        of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1, tumor growth factor (TGF) \u03b2, interleukin
        (IL) 1\u03b1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3, carbohydrate-responsive
        element-binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein
        (SREBP) 1c.\n\n\nResults\nBody weight was higher in CON-P, and insulin and
        HOMA values in HFF-P and CON-P (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Leptin, alanine
        and aspartate aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase
        and total bilirubin were increased (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001), and high and
        low density lipoproteins decreased (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) in HFF-N and
        HFF-P. Livers in HFF-P and HFF-N had higher relative weight and TG (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001),
        micro and macrovesicular steatosis, ballooning degeneration, Mallory-denk
        bodies, inflammation and necrosis, increased gene expression of TNF\u03b1,
        TGF\u03b2, IL1\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001), and decreased
        ChREBP (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001).\n\n\nConclusions\nIberian pigs fed a HFF
        diet recapitulate many pediatric NAFLD-associated features, in the absence
        of obesity and independently of probiotic supplementation, suggesting a potentially
        suitable model for pediatric NAFLD research.\n\n\nFunding Sources\nARI, AcornSeekers.",

        "title": "Western Diet-Induced Dysbiosis Is Associated with Intestinal Hyperplasia
        and Dysregulation of FXR-FGF19 Gene Expression in Juvenile Iberian Pigs (OR26-03-19).",
        "abstract": "Objectives\nThe Western diet has been associated with increased
        risk of colon cancer, partially due to changes in bile acid (BA) homeostasis.
        While diet-induced proliferation of intestinal mucosa has been documented
        in adults, it is unclear whether it can develop in pediatric populations.
        We hypothesize that feeding a high-fat high-fructose (HFF) diet to neonatal
        pigs will increase BA levels in liver and plasma, and cell proliferation in
        intestinal mucosa. In addition, we hypothesize that supplementation of a probiotic
        mixture with Pediococcus, Lactobacillus and Bacillus at 6.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104
        cfu/mL will ameliorate the HFF pro-proliferative effect.\n\n\nMethods\nTo
        test the hypothesis we used 10-d old Iberian pigs, which have a leptin-resistant
        phenotype resulting in rapid development of obesity and dyslipidemia. Diets
        contained (g/kg body weight\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0d) 0 g fructose, 11 g fat and
        199 kcal (CON-N; n\u00a0=\u00a08), 22 g fructose, 16 g fat and 300 kcal (HFF-N;
        n\u00a0=\u00a06), CON\u00a0+\u00a0probiotic (CON-P; n\u00a0=\u00a06), or HFF\u00a0+\u00a0probiotic
        (HFF-P; n\u00a0=\u00a06). Pigs were euthanized at 80 d of age. Liver and plasma
        BA levels were analyzed by LC-MS. Hyperplasia in colon and distal ileum (DI)
        was assessed by hematoxylin-eosin and Ki-67 staining. Bacteria in colon content
        were quantified at genus level by 16S ribosomal RNA analysis. Gene expression
        of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), small heterodimer partner (SHP), fibroblast
        growth factor 19 (FGF19), organic solute transporter (OST) \u03b1, apical
        sodium-dependent BA transporter (ASBT), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) \u03b1,
        tumor growth factor (TGF) \u03b2, takeda G-protein receptor (TGR) 5, and epidermal
        growth factor receptor (EGFR) was measured by qPCR.\n\n\nResults\nHFF-N an
        HFF-P increased taurocholate and glyocholate in liver and plasma (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0001),
        crypt depth, villi length and Ki-67\u00a0+ cells/crypt (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01)
        in colon and DI, and Clostridium, Bacteroides, Synergistes, and Bilophila
        populations in colon content (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). HFF-N and HFF-P increased
        expression of SHP, OST\u03b1, and ASBT and decreased FGF19 in DI (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05),
        and increased SHP and decreased TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 in colon (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).
        FXR, TGR5 and EGFR did not differ between groups.\n\n\nConclusions\nA high-fructose
        high-fat diet increased liver and plasma BA levels and downregulated FGF19
        expression in DI. Colonic hyperplasia, proliferation of BA tolerant bacteria
        and changes in SHP, TNF\u03b1 and TGF\u03b2 may be related to increased secondary
        BA in the colon.\n\n\nFunding Sources\nARI, AcornSeekers, STRIDE.", "venue":

        "abstract": "Obtaining a suitable diversity of food fish for feeding marine
        mammals is a major challenge for zoological institutions and marine parks.
        In recent years, several species of fish, which were once considered staples
        in diets of captive marine mammals are no longer available due to over-harvesting
        [Davis, 1999]. Although government agencies have taken measures to address
        this decline in natural fish populations, it may take years before they can
        withstand regular harvesting [Davis, 1999]. Obviously, depleting natural populations
        of wildlife to feed captive specimens is in direct conflict with the goals
        of conservation organizations. Recent advances in food science technology
        have led to the development of complete feeds that could be fed along with,
        or in place of fish. Currently, an experimental fish analog diet is manufactured
        by Purina Mills, Inc. Preliminary trials with earlier formulations of this
        diet with penguins (Sea World Florida) and pinnipeds (Denver Zoo) produced
        promising results and led to minor refinements in the product [Molitoris et
        al., 1998]. Currently, the revised product is being evaluated for use with
        cetaceans in the United States Navy Marine Mammal Program (San Diego, CA).
        The trials were intended to facilitate the integration of a food item (fish
        analog) which, following the study, was added to the standard California sea
        lion diet used in conjunction with other fish and marine invertebrate species
        currently offered. The goal of the project was to evaluate criteria influencing
        the palatability of the fish analog diet (Mazuri #3492) with California sea
        lions when offered as a portion of the total diet to facilitate this introduction.",

        Horses (Quarter Horse geldings 4.5 to 16 yr of age; mean BW 522 kg \u00b1

        by a 14-d collection period of feces and urine. Chelated sources of Cu, Zn,

        No significant differences among apparent the digestibility of DM, ADF, or

        culture, direct-fed microbials, and Yucca schidigera extract in horses: II.
        Nutrient excretion and potential environmental impact.", "abstract": "The
        objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that an equine diet formulated
        with chelated trace minerals, organic selenium, yeast culture, direct-fed
        microbials (DFM) and Yucca schidigera extract would decrease excretion of
        nutrients that have potential for environmental impact. Horses were acclimated
        to 100% pelleted diets formulated with (ADD) and without (CTRL) the aforementioned
        additives. Chelated sources of Cu, Zn, Mn, and Co were included in the ADD
        diet at a 100% replacement rate of sulfate forms used in the CTRL diet. Additionally,
        the ADD diet included organic selenium yeast, DFM, and Yucca schidigera extract.
        Ten horses were fed the 2 experimental diets during two 42-d periods in a
        crossover design. Total fecal and urine collection occurred during the last
        14 d of each period. Results indicate no significant differences between Cu,
        Zn, Mn, and Co concentrations excreted via urine (P > 0.05) due to dietary
        treatment. There was no difference between fecal Cu and Mn concentrations
        (P > 0.05) based on diet consumed. Mean fecal Zn and Co concentrations excreted
        by horses consuming ADD were greater than CTRL (P < 0.003). Differences due
        to diet were found for selenium fecal (P < 0.0001) and urine (P < 0.0001)
        excretions, with decreased concentrations found for horses consuming organic
        selenium yeast (ADD). In contrast, fecal K (%) was greater (P = 0.0421) for
        horses consuming ADD, whereas concentrations of fecal solids, total N, ammonia
        N, P, total ammonia, and fecal output did not differ between dietary treatments
        (P > 0.05). In feces stockpiled to simulate a crude composting method, no
        differences (P > 0.05) due to diet were detected for particle size, temperature,
        moisture, OM, total N, P, phosphate, K, moisture, potash, or ammonia N (P
        > 0.05). Although no difference (P = 0.2737) in feces stockpile temperature
        due to diet was found, temperature differences over time were documented (P
        < 0.0001). In conclusion, the addition of certain chelated mineral sources,
        organic Se yeast, DFM, and Yucca schidigera extract did not decrease most
        nutrient concentrations excreted. Horses consuming organic selenium as part
        of the additive diet had lower fecal and urine Se concentrations, as well
        as greater fecal K concentrations.", "venue": "Journal of Animal Science",

        are agile climbers and many aspects of behaviour in the wild are related to
        procuring food.\u00a0 In captive situations obesity can result from reduced
        activity and offering food in excess of energy requirements if food is not
        presented in a way that encourages increased foraging time.\u00a0 In December
        2006, a fifteen-year-old male spectacled bear was received into quarantine
        at the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National Zoological Park. During the
        quarantine examination, nutrition staff manually assessed body condition and
        at 222.5 kg, the animal was deemed grossly obese with a body condition score
        of 9 on a 1\u20139 point scale.\u00a0 A weight reduction plan was developed
        with a goal of gradual and continual weight loss at a rate of 1.0% of initial
        body weight (BW) per week, with a maximum of 2.0% and a minimum of 0.5% of
        initial BW/week to reach an initial summer target BW of 170 kg in 6\u20138
        months.\u00a0 Once the initial goal was achieved, seasonal target BW ranges
        were further refined over the following 12 months, resulting in a total weight
        loss of 77 kg (35% of initial BW).\u00a0 Throughout the process keepers noted
        a marked positive increase in physical activity and associated behaviours.\u00a0

        of the program is geared towards assessing contaminants nationally Utilizing
        formats such as Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing data
        assessment, an attempt will be made within this project to identify possible
        releasers of effluent waste into the major coastal watershed regions pertaining
        to ongoing research conducted within monitored mussel watch sites. The categorization
        of possible contaminating locations will be made available through the development
        of a large dataset. This dataset will utilize those derived from agencies
        such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) and other
        state government databases such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
        (NOAA), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Utilizing platforms

        data, vector data, line data, and polygons depicting points and sites of interest
        will be created using latitude and longitude information. Points and areas
        of interest (AOI) will be verified using Remote Sensing imagery. As such,
        Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (PBDEs) within observable mussel watch sites
        will be assessed by NOAA\u2019s Center for Coastal Monitoring and Assessment

        "title": "Giant Pandas: Nutrition and dietary husbandry", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION
        Nutrition involves a series of processes whereby an animal uses items in its
        external environment to support internal metabolism (Robbins, 1993). The nutrition
        and consequent nutritional status of an animal are basic to all aspects of
        health, including growth, reproduction and disease resistance. Thus, appropriate
        nutrition and feeding are essential to a comprehensive animal management and
        preventative medicine programme. The giant panda''s obligate dependence upon
        bamboo as a primary energy and nutrient source has been well described (Sheldon,
        1937; Schaller et al ., 1985). Many aspects of panda biology are directly
        related to its adaptations for utilisation of this highly fibrous, low energy
        density food, thus demonstrating the inseparable influence of nutrition on
        behaviour, reproduction and other physiological functions. There may be few
        other species that more effectively illustrate how an understanding of nutritional
        adaptations helps us interpret the species ecology. This chapter describes
        insights into the nutritional adaptations of the giant panda while identifying
        priority research that will fill gaps in our understanding of these unique
        abilities. Historical and current strategies on feeding giant pandas in captivity
        are presented along with recommendations for improving nutrition and dietary
        husbandry to promote health and feeding behaviours. ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, GUIDELINES
        AND ASSESSMENT Feeding ecology and anatomical adaptations to a herbivorous
        diet More than 99% of the food consumed by the free-ranging giant panda consists
        of bamboo (Schaller et al ., 1985). Yet the giant panda is unique in that
        it has the relatively simple gastrointestinal tract of a carnivore.", "venue":

        gazella callotis), with melengestrol acetate: Behavioral and endocrine observations",
        "abstract": "Aggression control is becoming an important component in the
        management of animals in captivity, but rigorous quantification of aggressive
        behavior has heretofore been lacking. This study was done to assess the ability
        of melengestrol acetate (MGA) given with feed (1.54 mg/kg) to control aggression
        in a bachelor group of fringe-eared oryx (Oryx gazella callotis). Systematic
        behavioral observations were conducted and fecal androgen content was measured
        for 42 and 90 days, respectively, before treatment, and during the 42 days
        of treatment. There was a significant reduction in concentrations of fecal
        androgen from 153 \u00b1 6.0 to 95 \u00b1 4.5 ng/g (T66 = 7, P < 0.0001).
        This reduction in androgen excretion was apparent after the first week of
        treatment. There was measurable MGA excreted in the feces during treatment.
        Although treatment did not arrest all aggressive behaviors among animals,
        the decline in androgens and increase in MGA was accompanied by a significant
        reduction in several measures of agonistic behavior. Posturing, aggressive
        contact, pursuit, and submission occurred significantly less frequently after
        treatment, and there was also a reduction in fighting-intention movements.
        Thus, both ritualized and nonritualized aspects of aggression were affected.
        Reductions in hormones and aggressive behaviors coincided temporally, suggestive
        of a potential causal relationship. Consistent with this hypothesis is a strong
        positive correlation between fecal androgen and total aggressive acts. This
        effect was not the result of a single behavioral element but occurred across
        several categories of agonistic behavior. Zoo Biol 20:375\u2013388, 2001.

        deer, roe deer, aoudads, and domestic goats did not suffer from Cu deficiency
        at the same liver Cu concentration level as that at which sheep and cows die
        from Cu deficiency. Therefore, a limit value as low as 20 mg Cu/kg liver dry

        "abstract": "We consider the migration of chemical species through saturated
        heterogeneous media, where the scale of the flow path geometry is large enough
        to invalidate a Fickian based, representative elementary volumes, approach
        to dispersal. Channel network models combine the effects of channeling over
        small spatial scales with network mixing which gives rise to an equivalent
        dispersion effect over large spatial scales. We extend equations and solutions
        given previously for ideal nonabsorbing tracers, to include the retardation
        of chemically active species. The primary aim is to derive explicit solutions
        for future calibration purposes, and illustrate scale dependent dispersive
        behavior with and without chemical absorption processes. In this paper we
        develop a twin channel model allowing for various specification of the retardation
        process. This allows the retardation to be either positively or negatively
        correlated with pathway apertures (which are in turn related directly to flow
        rates of the respective channels). We show that if absorption is controlled
        by specific surface area, then a scaling argument infers that highly transmissive
        paths are also less retarding. We illustrate the model\u2019s applicability
        to such cases. We shall discuss the scale dependence of calculated (observed)
        equivalent dispersivities obtained by analyzing the moments of breakthrough
        curves at various distances. For a range of parameter values we exhibit scaling
        behavior similar to that observed in the field and laboratory. This does not
        necessarily imply any validity to the approach: it is a direct consequence
        of deferring the network \u2014 mixing effect to large length scales. An important
        point of consideration is that wherever conceptual model choices must be made,
        in modeling natural processes such as chemical migration, there is a possibility
        of biasing calculations by sole reliance on a particular approach. Channel
        network models marry channeling models and classical Fickian models. Thus
        in calibrating a model such as the Twin Channel model from given experimental
        behavior, we can immediately estimate over which scales channeling or Fickian
        dispersive effects are likely to be dominant.", "venue": "", "year": 1995,

        viverrini crude antigens, which are elevated in neutrophils from opisthorchiasis
        patients with hepatobiliary abnormalities", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Opisthorchis
        viverrini (Ov) infection can cause several disease conditions of the bile
        duct including hepatobiliary abnormalities (HBAs) and the most severe, cholangiocarcinoma
        (CCA). Fibrosis occurs when tissues are damaged and normal wound-healing responses
        are dysregulated. Neutrophils are the first cells to migrate to an infection
        site to protect the host from intruding extracellular pathogens through a
        wide range of effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis, production of reactive
        oxygen species, proteases, or release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).
        In this work, we used confocal microscopy to assess whether Ov crude antigens
        can cause release of NETs from neutrophils from Ov-free individuals. We demonstrated
        for the first time that these antigens could induce release of NETs ex vivo
        in a dose-dependent manner from neutrophils isolated from Ov-free individuals.
        Intriguingly, when we measured NETs from neutrophils isolated from Ov-infected
        patients, we found increased spontaneous production of NETs in patients with
        HBAs. Interestingly, exposure to Ov crude antigens lowered the level of NETs
        released by neutrophils from patients with active Ov infection regardless
        of HBA status. We propose that in the case of acute Ov infection, even when
        concentration of Ov antigens is relatively low, neutrophils can form NETs.
        However, when this infection becomes chronic, manifesting as a definite HBA,
        the levels of NET production are reduced when treated with Ov crude antigens.
        Excessive production of proinflammatory mediators from these NETs might have
        effects on the parasites, but may also lead to excessive injury of surrounding
        tissues resulting in HBAs and may lead eventually to the most severe complications
        such as CCA.", "venue": "Biology Open", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 35,

        underlies psoriatic arthritis (PsA) has led to the development of effective
        targeted therapies, such as the IL-17A inhibitor, secukinumab. As IL-17A stimulates
        the secretion of neutrophil chemoattractants, such as CXCL8 (IL-8), we examined
        the effect of secukinumab on neutrophil function in PsA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNineteen
        patients with active PsA were treated with secukinumab. Clinical response
        (PsARC and PASI) and peripheral blood neutrophil function (apoptosis, receptor
        expression, phagocytosis/killing, chemotaxis and RNA expression) were measured
        at 12 week intervals for 48 weeks and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy
        controls.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAt 12 weeks 12/16 (75%) had a PsARC response (100%
        at 36 weeks) and 10/14 (71%) achieved a PASI90. At baseline, there were no
        differences in PsA neutrophil ROS generation, constitutive or cytokine-delayed
        apoptosis, chemotaxis or phagocytosis of opsonised Staphylococcus aureus,
        compared to healthy controls. Similarly, there were no differences in these
        functions from baseline to 12-weeks of therapy. However, surface levels of
        CD11b/CD18 and CD63 increased and expression of CD16 decreased during therapy.
        In addition, in a sub-group of early (12 week) responders to secukinumab,
        RNA-seq revealed transcriptome changes predicting down-regulation of cytokine

        complexes and low-density neutrophils in lupus nephritis.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nPlatelets
        and low-density neutrophils (LDNs) are major players in the immunopathogenesis
        of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Despite evidence showing the importance
        of platelet neutrophil complexes (PNCs) in inflammation, little is known about
        the relationship between LDNs and platelets in SLE. We sought to characterize
        the role of LDNs and TLR7 in clinical disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nFlow cytometry
        was used to immunophenotype LDNs from SLE patients and controls. The association
        of LDNs with organ damage was investigated in a cohort of 290 SLE patients.
        TLR7mRNA expression was assessed in LDNs and high-density neutrophils (HDNs)
        using publicly available mRNA sequencing datasets, and our own cohort using
        RT-PCR. The role of TLR7 in platelet binding was evaluated in platelet: HDN
        mixing studies using TLR7 deficient mice and Klinefelter syndrome patients.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSLE
        patients with active disease have more LDNs, which are heterogeneous and more
        immature in patients with evidence of kidney dysfunction. LDNs are platelet
        bound, in contrast to HDNs. LDNs settle in the PBMC layer due to the increased
        buoyancy and neutrophil degranulation from platelet binding. Mixing studies
        demonstrated that this PNC formation was dependent on platelet-TLR7, and that
        the association results in increased NETosis. The neutrophil-to-platelet ratio
        (NPR), is a useful clinical correlate for LDNs, and a higher NPR is associated
        with past and current flares of lupus nephritis.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nLDNs sediment
        in the upper PBMC fraction due to PNC formation, which is dependent on the
        expression of TLR7 in platelets. Collectively, our results reveal a novel
        TLR7-dependent crosstalk between platelets and neutrophils, which may be an
        important therapeutic opportunity for lupus nephritis.", "venue": "Rheumatology",

        Extracellular Traps by Enoxaparin in COVID-19 Patients", "abstract": "Neutrophil
        Extracellular Traps (NETs) are a contributing factor of vascular thrombosis
        and alveolar damage in COVID-19 patients. As enoxaparin is currently used
        to inhibit vascular thrombosis, this study aimed to investigate whether enoxaparin
        also reduced inflammation and NETs in COVID-19 patients. Patients with COVID-19
        infection were classified into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe (n
        = 10 for all groups). Plasma was collected from patients and healthy donors
        (n = 10). Neutrophils isolated from healthy controls were incubated with COVID-19
        or healthy plasma, and with or without enoxaparin pretreatment in vitro. Neutrophils
        and plasma isolated from patients treated with enoxaparin were also investigated.
        The levels of inflammatory cytokines and NET products such as dsDNA, NE, MPO\u2013DNA
        and Histone\u2013DNA complexes in plasma and supernatants were measured using
        immunofluorescence staining and ELISA kits. The expression of inflammatory
        signaling genes by neutrophils (RELA, SYK, ERK and PKC) was measured using
        real-time qPCR. The levels of NET products were elevated in the plasma of
        COVID-19 patients, particularly in the severe group (p < 0.01). Moreover,
        plasma from the severe group enhanced NET formation (p < 0.01) from neutrophils
        in vitro. Enoxaparin pretreatment in vitro decreased plasma-induced NETs in
        a dose-dependent manner and down-regulated the expression of inflammatory
        genes (p < 0.05). Patients treated with prophylactic enoxaparin showed lower
        inflammatory cytokine levels and expression of inflammatory genes (p < 0.05).
        Increased NETs were associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection, particularly
        in patients with severe pneumonia, and could be used as biomarkers to assess
        disease severity. Enoxaparin pretreatment inhibited NETs and reduced the expression
        of inflammatory cytokines, and these effects mostly persisted in patients
        treated with prophylactic enoxaparin.", "venue": "International Journal of

        of colorectal cancer (CRC) is important for the early detection. CRC is relating
        to aging and immuno-senescence. One such senescent marker is p16INK4A expression
        in immune cells. The objective of the study is to investigate the protein
        expression of p16INK4A in peripheral white blood cells as a screening marker
        for colorectal cancer. Methods: A case-control studies were conducted. Cases
        were patients with colorectal cancer and controls were matched with cases
        based on age and sex. Peripheral blood was collected from patients and controls
        and the protein p16INK4A was measured with immunofluorescent techniques. The
        p16INK4A levels from cases and controls were evaluated using ROC analysis
        to be used as a screening marker in CRC patients. Mean fluorescent intensity
        of p16INK4A of cases and controls were analyzed in CD45+, CD3+ or CD14+ cells.
        The p16INK4A levels of cases were also correlated with clinical data. Result:
        Statistically significant increased expression of p16INK4A levels were found
        in cases compared to controls. p16INK4A in peripheral immune cells had 78%
        sensitivity and 71% specificity which can possibly be used as a diagnosis

        NDMVs on proinflammatory cytokines expressed by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1
        (TNF\u03b1)-stimulated fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS). FLS were isolated
        from the synovium of knee osteoarthritis (OA) patients undergoing surgery.
        NDMVs, isolated from TNF\u03b1-stimulated healthy neutrophils, were characterized
        by electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis. MTT and scratch
        wound healing assays were used to measure FLS viability and migration after
        treatment with NDMVs, while internalization of fluorescently labeled NDMVs
        was appraised by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Levels of proinflammatory
        cytokines in supernatants were quantified by the Bio-Plex system. Incubation
        of FLS with NDMVs at a vesicle/cell ratio of 100 resulted in a time-dependent
        uptake, with 35% of synoviocytes containing microvesicles over a 6\u201324
        h time period, with no significant change in cell viability. TNF\u03b1 stimulated
        the cytokine expression in FLS, and NDMVs down-regulated TNF\u03b1-induced
        expression of IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, IFN\u03b3 and MIP-1\u03b2. However,
        this down-regulation was selective, as NDMVs had no significant effects on
        TNF\u03b1-stimulated expression of IL-2 or IL-4. NDMVs were internalized by
        FLS to inhibit TNF\u03b1-stimulated broad-spectrum proinflammatory cytokine
        secretion. NDMVs, therefore, may exhibit an anti-inflammatory role in the
        regulation of the FLS function.", "venue": "International Journal of Molecular

        inflammatory disorder affecting synovial joints. Neutrophils are believed
        to play an important role in both the initiation and progression of RA, and
        large numbers of activated neutrophils are found within both synovial fluid
        (SF) and synovial tissue from RA joints. In this study we analyzed paired
        blood and SF neutrophils from patients with severe, active RA (DAS28>5.1,
        n=3) using RNA-seq. 772 genes were significantly different between blood and
        SF neutrophils. IPA analysis predicted that SF neutrophils had increased expression
        of chemokines and ROS production, delayed apoptosis, and activation of signaling
        cascades regulating the production of NETs. This activated phenotype was confirmed
        experimentally by incubating healthy control neutrophils in cell-free RA SF,
        which was able to delay apoptosis and induce ROS production in both unprimed
        and TNF\u03b1 primed neutrophils (p<0.05). RA SF significantly increased neutrophil
        migration through 3\u03bcM transwell chambers (p<0.05) and also increased
        production of NETs by healthy control neutrophils (p<0.001), including exposure
        of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone-H3-positive DNA NETs. IPA
        analysis predicted NET production was mediated by signaling networks including
        AKT, RAF1, SRC, and NF-\u03baB. Our results expand the understanding of the
        molecular changes that take place in the neutrophil transcriptome during migration
        into inflamed joints in RA, and the altered phenotype in RA SF neutrophils.
        Specifically, RA SF neutrophils lose their migratory properties, residing
        within the joint to generate signals that promote joint damage, as well as
        inflammation via recruitment and activation of both innate and adaptive immune
        cells. We propose that this activated SF neutrophil phenotype contributes
        to the chronic inflammation and progressive damage to cartilage and bone observed

        is a common non-albicans Candida species found in patients with candidiasis
        and it sometimes develops antifungal resistance. Human beta-defensin-3 (hBD-3)
        is an antimicrobial peptide of immune system active against various types
        of microbes including Candida spp. This study investigated antifungal activity
        of hBD-3 and its synergistic effect with a first-line antifungal agent on
        C. glabrata clinical isolates. Candida spp. were characterised in patients
        with candidiasis. The antifungal activities of hBD-3 and fluconazole against
        C. glabrata were evaluated using Broth microdilution assay. The synergistic
        activity of these two agents was determined by checkerboard microdilution
        and time-killing assays. The cytotoxicity of hBD-3 was evaluated using LDH-cytotoxicity
        colorimetric assay. Of 307 episodes from 254 patients diagnosed with candidiasis,
        C. glabrata was found in 21 clinical isolates. Antifungal susceptibility tests
        of C. glabrata were performed, fluconazole demonstrated an inhibitory effect
        at concentrations of 0.25-8 \u03bcg/ml, but one antifungal resistant strain
        was identified (>64 \u03bcg/ml). hBD-3 showed an inhibitory effect against
        all selected strains at concentrations of 50-75 \u03bcg/ml and exhibited a
        synergistic effect with fluconazole at the fractional inhibitory concentration
        index (FICI) of 0.25-0.50. A concentration of 25 \u03bcg/ml of hBD-3 alone
        showed no cytotoxicity but synergistic activity was seen with fluconazole.
        In conclusion, hBD-3 has antifungal activity against C. glabrata and synergistic
        effects with fluconazole at concentrations that alone, have no cytotoxicity.
        hBD-3 could be used as an adjunctive therapy with first-line antifungal agents
        for patients with C. glabrata infection particularly those infected with fluconazole-resistant

        reactive oxygen species production and chemokine expression via activation
        of p38 MAPK", "abstract": "Interferons (IFNs) are key regulators of a number
        of inflammatory conditions in which neutrophils play an important role in
        pathology, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus
        (SLE), where Type I IFNs are implicated in disease pathology. However, IFNs
        are usually generated in vivo together with other cytokines that also have
        immunoregulatory functions but such interactions are poorly-defined experimentally.
        We measured the effects of Type-I IFN (IFN\u03b1), elevated in both RA and
        SLE, on the functions of healthy neutrophils incubated in vitro in the absence
        and presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines typically elevated in inflammatory
        diseases (TNF\u03b1, GM-CSF). IFN\u03b1 alone had no effect on neutrophil
        apoptosis, however it did abrogate the anti-apoptotic effect of GM-CSF (18h,
        p< 0.01). The enhanced stabilty of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and delayed
        activation of caspase activation normally regulated by GM-CSF were blocked
        by IFN\u03b1: this effect was mediated, in part, by activation of p38 MAPK,
        increased turnover of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1 and cleavage of caspases.
        IFN\u03b1 alone also primed ROS production alone and maintained the transient
        priming effect of TNF for up to 4h: it also down-regulated GM-CSF and TNF\u03b1-activated
        expression of CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, CCL3 and CCL4, but in contrast increased
        the expression of CXCL10. These novel data identify complex regulatory signalling
        networks in which Type I IFNs profoundly alter the response of neutrophils
        to inflammatory cytokines. This is likely to have important consequences in
        vivo and may explain the complexity and heterogeneity of inflammatory diseases
        such as RA, in which multiple cytokine cascades have been activated.", "venue":

        Restored by ex vivo Ascorbate Incubation", "abstract": "Background Neutrophil
        function is essential for effective defence against bacterial infections but
        is defective in patients with sepsis. Ascorbate or vitamin C, which is low
        in the plasma of patients with sepsis, is stored inside human neutrophils
        and is essential for their normal function. Objective This study aimed to
        determine if ascorbate treatment ex vivo improved neutrophil function in patients
        with sepsis. Patients and Methods Human blood neutrophils were isolated from
        20 patients with sepsis and 20 healthy age-matched controls. Neutrophils were
        incubated with or without ascorbate (1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mM) for periods up
        to 2h. Chemotaxis was evaluated using a chemotactic chamber in response to
        the chemoattractant, fMLP. Phagocytosis (uptake of pHrodo red stained S. aureus)
        and apoptosis (annexin-V/propidium iodide staining) were measured by flow
        cytometry. Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation was detected and
        quantified using DAPI, anti-myeloperoxidase and anti-neutrophil elastase immuno-fluorescence
        staining. Quantifluor detected the amount of dsDNA in NET supernatants, while
        quantitative PCR identified changes in expression of PADI4 gene. Results Chemotactic
        and phagocytic activities were decreased in patients with sepsis but increased
        after treatment with the high concentrations of ascorbate. Apoptosis was increased
        in the sepsis patients but not altered by ascorbate treatment. Spontaneous
        NET formation was observed in patients with sepsis. A quantity of 1mM ascorbate
        decreased spontaneous NETosis to that of normal, healthy neutrophils, while
        high concentrations of ascorbate (>10mM) further promoted NET formation. Conclusion
        Dysregulated neutrophil function was observed in patients with sepsis which
        could contribute to disease pathology and outcomes. Exposure to ascorbate
        could reverse some of these changes in function. These novel discoveries raise
        the possibility that ascorbate treatment could be used as an adjunctive therapy
        that could result in improved neutrophil function during sepsis.", "venue":

        "title": "The Inhibitory Effect of Validamycin A on Aspergillus flavus", "abstract":
        "Aspergillus flavus is one of the most common isolates from patients with
        fungal infections. Aspergillus infection is usually treated with antifungal
        agents, but side effects of these agents are common. Trehalase is an essential
        enzyme involved in fungal metabolism, and the trehalase inhibitor, validamycin
        A, has been used to prevent fungal infections in agricultural products. In
        this study, we observed that validamycin A significantly increased trehalose
        levels in A. flavus conidia and delayed germination, including decreased fungal
        adherence. In addition, validamycin A and amphotericin B showed a combinatorial
        effect on A. flavus ATCC204304 and clinical isolates with high minimum inhibitory
        concentrations (MICs) of amphotericin B using checkerboard assays. We observed
        that validamycin A and amphotericin B had a synergistic effect on A. flavus
        strains resistant to amphotericin B. The MICs in the combination of validamycin
        A and amphotericin B were at 0.125\u2009\u03bcg/mL and 2\u2009\u03bcg/mL,
        respectively. The FICI of validamycin A and amphotericin B of these clinical
        isolates was about 0.25\u20130.28 with synergistic effects. No drug cytotoxicity
        was observed in human bronchial epithelial cells treated with validamycin
        A using LDH-cytotoxicity assays. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that
        validamycin A inhibited the growth of A. flavus and delayed conidial germination.
        Furthermore, the combined effect of validamycin A with amphotericin B increased
        A. flavus killing, without significant cytotoxicity to human bronchial epithelial
        cells. We propose that validamycin A could potentially be used in vivo as
        an alternative treatment for A. flavus infections.", "venue": "International

        "\n Neutrophils are considered to be mature and terminally differentiated.
        They are short-lived, lack proliferation capacity and are impossible to transfect
        in vitro to express exogenous genes or proteins. These properties have made
        their ex vivo experimental manipulation and biochemical studies of their signal
        activation mechanisms and genetic makeup, challenging. Establishment of cell
        line models capable of differentiating along the myeloid lineage into mature
        neutrophil-like granulocytes, with similar morphological and functional properties
        to blood neutrophils would, therefore, be an important tool to enable transfection
        of key genes and determine the effects of such manipulations on neutrophil
        functions. PLB-985 is a recently established cell line that has been demonstrated
        to show greater levels of differentiation into granulocyte in the presence
        of appropriate differentiation-inducing agents, but the efficiency of differentiation
        reported so far was very low, and the differentiated cells only partly resembled
        mature blood neutrophils. This study developed a modified differentiation

        neutrophil-like phenotypes of PLB-985 cells that resembled mature blood neutrophil
        morphology, and which had an appreciably delayed apoptosis have been consistently
        cultured. This was evident by the acquisition of multi-lobed nucleus, granulated

        DEFENCE IN PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS", "abstract": "Biologic therapies have revolutionised
        therapy in inflammatory diseases such as psoriatic arthritis (PsA), driving
        major improvements in outcomes. Th17 cells appear to play a key role in the
        pathogenesis of PsA, and IL-17 can trigger the release of chemoattractants
        such as CXCL8 and CCL20, leading to the further infiltration of other immune
        cells including neutrophils. Infiltrating activated neutrophils can themselves
        generate a range of chemoattractants which may amplify and sustain the inflammatory
        response. Therapeutic targeting of IL-17 with biologics such as secukinumab
        offers great benefit in PsA by blocking this inflammatory cycle: however the
        interaction of this agent with neutrophils, key components of host defence
        as well as potential mediators of this disease, is not known.This study aimed
        to measure key aspects of neutrophil function to determine: a) changes in
        the functions of circulating neutrophils in PsA patients pre-therapy, compared
        to age- and sex-matched healthy controls and b) if these functions changed
        in PsA patients 12-weeks post-secukinumab therapy.Neutrophils were isolated
        from venous blood of 16 PsA patients and 10 healthy controls. Key neutrophil
        functions were measured at baseline and 12 weeks: reactive oxygen species
        (ROS) production, apoptosis (+/- TNF and GM-CSF), phagocytosis, receptor expression
        and chemotaxis. Changes in gene expression pre- and 12-weeks post-therapy
        (n=5 PsA) were measured using RNAseq.PsARC response was observed in 70.6%
        of participants on secukinumab therapy at 12 weeks. There were no significant
        differences in ROS production, phagocytosis or chemotaxis in PsA patients
        at baseline (compared to healthy controls) or during therapy. Chemotaxis towards
        IL-8 in PsA patients at baseline was decreased compared to that of healthy
        controls, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Surface
        levels of activation markers CD11b/CD18 and CD63 were increased in PsA patients
        at 12-weeks compared to baseline, while surface levels of CD16 decreased.
        RNA-seq analysis indicated down-regulation of pathways mediated by IL-17A,
        oncostatin M, TWEAK (TNFSF12) and CCL2 during therapy, but up-regulated expression
        of pathways involvingde novoprotein biosynthesis.Therapy with secukimumab
        in PsA did not significantly affect neutrophil host defence functions. The
        changes that were seen in circulating neutrophils indicate selective up- and
        down-regulation of functions that may reflect potential alterations in local
        or systemic cytokines, and/or an increase in the circulating pool of activated
        neutrophils that are no longer recruited into sites of inflammation because
        of the down-regulation of the local IL-17/CXCL8 signalling network.Andrew

        "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common chronic inflammatory skin
        diseases and is caused by multiple factors including genetic factors, skin

        effects, and infections. Commonly, bacterial and viral infections are present
        in the eczematous lesions of AD patients and clearly aggravate the symptoms.
        However, studies of fungal infections in AD are limited in spite of the fact
        that there are reports showing that Malassezia, Candida, and some dermatophytes
        can affect the symptoms of AD. Moreover, certain fungal infections are sometimes
        overlooked and need to be considered particularly in AD patients with treatment
        failure as clinical features of those fungal infections could mimic eczematous

        reactive oxygen species production and chemokine expression", "abstract":
        "Interferons (IFNs) are key regulators of a number of inflammatory conditions
        in which neutrophils play an important role in pathology, such as rheumatoid
        arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), where type I IFNs are
        implicated in disease pathology. However, IFNs are usually generated in vivo
        together with other cytokines that also have immunoregulatory functions, but
        such interactions are poorly defined experimentally. We measured the effects
        of type I (IFN\u2010\u03b1) IFN, elevated in both RA and SLE, on the functions
        of healthy neutrophils incubated in vitro in the absence and presence of proinflammatory
        cytokines typically elevated in inflammatory diseases [tumour necrosis factor
        (TNF\u2010\u03b1), granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor
        (GM\u2010CSF)]. IFN\u2010\u03b1 alone had no effect on neutrophil apoptosis;
        however, it abrogated the anti\u2010apoptotic effect of GM\u2010CSF (18 h,
        P < 0\u00b701). The enhanced stability of the anti\u2010apoptotic protein
        myeloid cell leukaemia 1 (Mcl\u20101) and delayed activation of caspase activation
        normally regulated by GM\u2010CSF were blocked by IFN\u2010\u03b1: this effect
        was mediated, in part, by activation of p38 mitogen\u2010activated protein
        kinase (MAPK). IFN\u2010\u03b1 alone also primed reactive oxygen species (ROS)
        production and maintained the transient priming effect of TNF\u2010\u03b1
        for up to 4 h: it also down\u2010regulated GM\u2010CSF\u2010 and TNF\u2010\u03b1\u2010activated
        expression of chemokine (C\u2010X\u2010C motif) ligand (CXCL)1, CXCL2, CXCL3,
        CXCL8, CCL3 and CCL4 but, in contrast, increased the expression of CXCL10.
        These novel data identify complex regulatory signalling networks in which
        type I IFNs profoundly alter the response of neutrophils to inflammatory cytokines.
        This is likely to have important consequences in vivo and may explain the
        complexity and heterogeneity of inflammatory diseases such as RA, in which
        multiple cytokine cascades have been activated.", "venue": "Clinical and Experimental

        subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes, and synovitis, resulting in chronic joint
        pain and physical disability in the elderly. The purpose of this study was
        to investigate mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNACN) and inflammatory cytokines
        in primary knee OA patients and healthy volunteers. A total of 204 knee OA
        patients and 169 age-matched healthy volunteers were recruited. Their relative
        blood leukocyte mtDNACN was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase
        chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and ten inflammatory cytokines in their plasma were
        detected by multiplex immunoassay. Blood leukocyte mtDNACN in the OA group
        was significantly lower than that in the control group. Leukocyte mtDNACN
        in the control group was negatively correlated with their age (r=\u22120.380,
        P<0.0001), whereas mtDNACN in the OA group was positively correlated with
        their age (r=0.198, P<0.001). Plasma interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-6 were significantly
        higher in the knee OA group than in the control group. The plasma IL-6 level
        was positively correlated with blood leukocyte mtDNACN in the OA group (r=0.547,
        P=0.0014). IL-5 showed as a major factor (coefficient 0.69) in the second

        significantly higher in the OA group (P<0.001) as well as negatively correlated
        with mtDNACN (r=\u22120.577, P<0.001). These findings suggest that elevation
        of plasma IL-4 and IL-6 and a relative reduction in mtDNACN might be effective
        biomarkers for knee OA. IL-5 is a plausible factor responsible for decreasing

        inflammation via the generation of a range of cytokines that affect all elements
        of the immune system. Here, we investigated their ability to express some
        of the members of the IL\u201012 family after incubation with TLR8 agonists.
        Highly pure human neutrophils were thus incubated for up to 48 h with or without
        R848, or other TLR8 agonists, to then measure the expression levels of transcripts
        and proteins for IL\u201012 family member subunits by RNA\u2010seq, reverse

        adult SLE (ASLE) patients present with different clinical manifestations,
        but it is unknown if there are differences in their antinuclear autoantibody
        (ANA) profiles or if staining patterns are associated with specific autoantibodies
        and clinical manifestations.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo determine whether distinct
        types and numbers of ANA-staining patterns are associated with specific autoantibodies
        and clinical manifestations in JSLE and ASLE patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA retrospective
        study was performed in Thai children (n = 146) and adults (n = 180) diagnosed
        with SLE using the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics classification
        criteria.\n\n\nRESULTS\nJSLE patients with a homogeneous pattern of staining
        and anti-dsDNA or anti-nucleosome antibodies in serum, developed renal involvement,
        leukopenia and acute/subacute cutaneous LE. Coarse speckled pattern with anti-RNP
        or anti-Sm showed thrombocytopenia and renal involvement in JSLE patients,
        but leukopenia in both groups. JSLE patients with fine-coarse speckled pattern
        and anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-Ro-52 or anti-SSA developed leukopenia, thrombocytopenia
        and renal involvement, whilst hemolytic anemia and serositis were commonly
        found in those with anti-Ro-52. Median SLEDAI score was higher in JSLE than
        ASLE patients.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nDetailed ANA-staining patterns with specific
        autoantibodies show particular clinical manifestations and hence prompt further
        clinical investigations in both JSLE and ASLE patients. Therefore, this study

        "title": "A robust intracellular metabolite extraction protocol for human
        neutrophil metabolic profiling", "abstract": "Neutrophils are phagocytic innate
        immune cells that play essential roles in host defence, but are also implicated
        in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) where they contribute
        to systemic inflammation and joint damage. Transcriptomic analysis of neutrophils
        has revealed significant changes in gene expression in neutrophils activated
        in vitro by cytokines and in vivo during inflammation in RA. However, there
        are no reports on the global metabolomic changes that occur as a consequence
        of this activation. The aim of this study was to establish protocols for the
        study of changes in the metabolome of human neutrophils using 1H NMR spectroscopy.
        Sample preparation and spectral analysis protocols were optimised using neutrophils
        isolated by Ficoll-Paque, with decreased washing steps and inclusion of a
        heat-shock step to quench metabolite turnover. Cells were incubated \u00b1
        PMA for 15 min in HEPES-free media and samples were analysed by NMR using
        a 700 MHz NMR Avance IIIHD Bruker NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI cryoprobe.
        Chenomx, Bruker TopSpin and AMIX software were used to process spectra and
        identify metabolites. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and signalling pathway
        analysis was carried out using Metaboanalyst. Cell number and number of scans
        (NS) were optimised as >3.6 million cells and 512 NS. 327 spectral bins were
        defined in the neutrophil spectra, of which 287 (87.7%) were assigned to 110
        metabolites that included: amino acids, peptides and analogues; carbohydrates,
        carbonyls and alcohols; nucleotides, nucleosides and analogues; lipids and
        lipid-like molecules; benzenoids; and other organic compounds. 43 metabolites
        changed at least 1.5 fold (increase or decrease) after the addition of PMA
        for 5 or 15 min. Pathway analysis revealed that PMA affected nicotinate and
        nicotinamide metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and glycolysis, suggesting
        a redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to the pentose phosphate
        pathway and production of NADPH for activation of the NADPH oxidase and subsequent
        respiratory burst. We have developed protocols for the study of human neutrophils
        by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Importantly, this methodology has sufficient sensitivity
        and reproducibility to detect changes in metabolite abundance from cell numbers
        typically collected from clinical samples or experiments with multiple assay
        conditions.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2018, "referenceCount": 62, "citationCount":

        fluke infection caused by Opisthorchis viverrini induces several hepatobiliary
        conditions including advanced periductal fibrosis (APF) and cholangiocarcinoma
        (CCA), but >25% of the infected population develops APF and 1% develop CCA.
        The innate immune response is the first line of defence, and macrophages are
        critical regulators of fibrosis. We hypothesized that macrophages from infected
        individuals have different capacities to either promote or suppress periductal
        fibrosis. We compared phagocytic activities of macrophages of healthy individuals
        and O viverrini\u2010infected individuals \u00b1 APF, and found that macrophages
        from infected individuals with APF ingested significantly higher numbers of
        beads compared with healthy controls and O viverrini\u2010infected individuals
        without APF. To further investigate proteolytic activity, we monitored real\u2010time
        phagosomal proteolysis of beads conjugated to DQ\u2010BODIPY\u2010BSA using
        live cell imaging. We show that macrophages from O viverrini\u2010infected
        individuals with APF also have elevated phagosomal proteolysis activity, which
        is consistent with their increased phagocytic activity. Additionally, stimulated
        ROS production by blood monocytes was higher in individuals with APF compared
        with healthy controls and infected individuals without APF. These results
        suggest that during O viverrini infection, macrophages with high phagocytic
        and proteolytic activities together with elevated ROS production are the phenotypes
        that can promote tissue damage, which results in periductal fibrosis.", "venue":

        granulocytes (LDGs) are functionally different from RA neutrophils. LDGs from
        32 RA patients were characterized using flow cytometry and quantitative PCR
        (qPCR). RNA sequencing (RNA\u2010Seq) was carried out on paired RA LDGs and
        neutrophils (n = 4) and validated using qPCR. Functional assays included chemotaxis,
        phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, cell\u2010cycle analysis,
        apoptosis, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)osis, and measurement of cytokine
        production (n \u2265 5 paired RA LDGs/neutrophils). RA LDGs had a substantially
        altered transcriptome, expressing >5000 genes at significantly different levels
        compared with RA neutrophils, including elevated levels of transcripts for
        granule proteins [including elastase and myeloperoxidase (MPO)] and cell\u2010cycle
        genes [including cyclin\u2010dependent kinase (CDK)2, CDK4, and CDK6]. Approximately
        1% of RA LDGs stained positive for the G2/S phase of the cell cycle. RA LDGs
        had a significantly lower constitutive rate of apoptosis compared with RA
        neutrophils and did not respond to TNF\u2010\u03b1 in culture. Expression
        of transcripts for cytokines and cytokine receptors was lower in RA LDGs.
        NET formation was lower in LDGs in response to PMA compared with RA neutrophils.
        Chemotaxis and phagocytosis was lower in RA LDGs compared with neutrophils.
        RA LDGs produced significantly lower amounts of ROS in response to fMLP following
        priming with TNF\u2010\u03b1. Expression of TNFR1 and \u20102 mRNA and protein
        was significantly lower in LDGs. We conclude that RA LDGS are functionally
        different from RA neutrophils, representing an immature neutrophil population
        within peripheral blood. Their enhanced survival properties and decreased
        TNF signaling are likely to have important consequences for disease pathology

        factor inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis", "abstract": "Neutrophils are implicated
        in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but the mechanisms regulating
        their activation are largely unknown. RA is a heterogeneous disease, and whereas
        many patients show clinical improvement during TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy,
        a significant proportion fails to respond. In vitro activation of neutrophils
        with agents, including TNF, results in rapid and selective changes in gene
        expression, but how neutrophils contribute to TNF signaling in RA and whether
        TNFi sensitivity involves differential neutrophil responses are unknown. With
        the use of RNA sequencing (RNA\u2010Seq), we analyzed blood neutrophils from
        20 RA patients, pre\u2010TNFi therapy, to identify biomarkers of response,
        measured by a decrease in disease activity score based on 28 joint count (DAS28),
        12 wk post\u2010therapy. Biomarkers were validated by quantitative PCR (qPCR)
        of blood neutrophils from 2 further independent cohorts of RA patients: 16
        pre\u2010TNFi and 16 predisease\u2010modifying anti\u2010rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
        Twenty\u2010three neutrophil transcripts predicted a 12\u2010wk response to
        TNFi: 10 (IFN\u2010regulated) genes predicting a European League against Rheumatism
        (EULAR) good response and 13 different genes [neutrophil granule protein (NGP)
        genes] predicting a nonresponse. Statistical analysis indicated a predictive
        sensitivity and specificity of each gene in the panel of >80%, with some 100%
        specific. A combination of 3 genes [cytidine monophosphate kinase 2 (CMPK2),
        IFN\u2010induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1B (IFIT1B), and RNASE3]
        had the greatest predictive power [area under the curve (AUC) 0.94]. No correlation
        was found for a response to DMARDs. We conclude that this panel of genes is
        selective for predicting a response to TNFi and is not a surrogate marker
        for disease improvement. We also show that in RA, there is great plasticity
        in neutrophil phenotype, with circulating cells expressing genes normally
        only expressed in more immature cells.", "venue": "Journal of Leukocyte Biology",

        primes the respiratory burst, delays apoptosis and induces the expression

        aimed to determine the impact of TNF\u2010\u03b1 exposure on the expression

        Transcriptome Studies", "abstract": "Protocols for the isolation of neutrophils
        from whole blood often result in neutrophil preparations containing low numbers
        (~5%) of contaminating leukocytes, and it is possible that these contaminating
        cells contribute to highly sensitive assays that measure neutrophil gene expression
        (e.g. qPCR). We investigated the contribution of contaminating leukocytes
        on the transcriptome profile of human neutrophils following stimulation with
        inflammatory cytokines (GM-CSF, TNF\u03b1), using RNA-Seq. Neutrophils were
        isolated using Polymorphprep or the StemCell untouched neutrophil isolation
        kit (negative selection of \u201chighly pure\u201d neutrophils). The level
        of contamination was assessed by morphology and flow cytometry. The major
        source of contamination in Polymorphprep neutrophil preparations was from
        eosinophils and was highly donor dependent. Contaminating cells were largely,
        but not completely, absent in neutrophil suspensions prepared using negative
        selection, but the overall yield of neutrophils was decreased by around 50%.
        RNA-seq analysis identified only 25 genes that were significantly differentially-expressed
        between Polymorphprep and negatively-selected neutrophils across all three
        treatment groups (untreated, GM-CSF, TNF\u03b1). The expression levels of
        34 cytokines/chemokines both before and after GM-CSF or TNF\u03b1 treatment
        were not significantly different between neutrophil isolation methods and
        therefore not affected by contributions from non-neutrophil cell types. This
        work demonstrates that low numbers (<5%) of contaminating leukocytes in neutrophil
        preparations contribute very little to the overall gene expression profile
        of cytokine-stimulated neutrophils, and that protocols for the isolation of
        highly pure neutrophils result in significantly lower yields of cells which
        may hinder investigations where large numbers of cells are required or where
        volumes of blood are limited.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        Macrophages and Its Enhancement by Hydroxychloroquine and Vitamin D", "abstract":
        "Background:Crohn''s disease (CD) is associated with defective innate immunity,
        including impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, and mucosal invasion by bacteria,
        particularly adherent and invasive Escherichia coli that replicate inside
        macrophage phagolysosomes. We compared CD and healthy control (HC) macrophages
        for their abilities to kill E. coli and generate neutrophil chemoattractants
        and also assessed the effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and vitamin D on
        killing of phagocytosed E. coli. Methods:Peripheral blood monocyte-derived
        macrophages from CD and HC were compared for bacterial killing and generation
        of neutrophil chemoattractants in response to CD-derived E. coli. Escherichia
        coli replication was also assessed in the presence and absence of HCQ, alone
        and with antibiotics, and vitamin D. Results:Monocyte-derived macrophages
        from patients with CD were similar to HC in allowing replication of phagocytosed
        CD-derived E. coli: HM605 {CD: N = 10, mean fold replication in 3 hr = 1.08
        (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39\u20131.78); HC: N = 9, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.02\u20131.97);
        P = 0.15} and also in generation of neutrophil chemoattractants in response
        to E. coli (mean fold chemotaxis relative to control: CD = 2.55 [95% CI, 2.31\u20132.80];
        HC = 2.65 [95% CI, 2.46\u20132.85], P = 0.42). HCQ and 1,25 OH2-vitamin D3
        both caused dose-dependent inhibition of intramacrophage E. coli replication
        3-hour postinfection; HCQ: 73.9% inhibition (P < 0.001) at 1 &mgr;g/mL, accompanied
        by raised intraphagosomal pH, and 1,25 OH2-vitamin D3: 80.7% inhibition (P
        < 0.05) at 80 nM. HCQ had synergistic effects with doxycycline and ciprofloxacin.
        Conclusions:CD and HC macrophages perform similarly in allowing replication
        of phagocytosed E. coli and generating neutrophil chemoattractants. Replication
        of phagocytosed E. coli was substantially decreased by HCQ and vitamin D.
        These warrant further therapeutic trials in CD in combination with relevant
        antibiotics.", "venue": "Inflammatory Bowel Diseases", "year": 2015, "referenceCount":

        correlates with a good response to TNFi therapy.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nThe
        aim of this study was to use whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) of RA
        neutrophils to identify pre-therapy gene expression signatures that correlate
        with disease activity or response to TNF inhibitor (TNFi) therapy.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNeutrophils
        were isolated from the venous blood of RA patients (n = 20) pre-TNFi therapy
        and from healthy controls (n = 6). RNA was poly(A) selected and sequenced
        on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Reads were mapped to the human genome
        (hg19) using TopHat and differential expression analysis was carried out using
        edgeR (5% false discovery rate). Signalling pathway analysis was carried out
        using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software. IFN signalling was confirmed
        by western blotting for phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of
        transcription (STAT) proteins. Response to TNFi was measured at 12 weeks using
        change in the 28-item DAS (DAS28).\n\n\nRESULTS\nPathway analysis with IPA
        predicted activation of IFN signalling in RA neutrophils, identifying 178
        IFN-response genes regulated by IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2 or IFN-\u03b3 (P <
        0.01). IPA also predicted activation of STAT1, STAT2 and STAT3 transcription
        factors in RA neutrophils (P < 0.01), which was confirmed by western blotting.
        Expression of IFN-response genes was heterogeneous and patients could be categorized
        as IFN-high or IFN-low. Patients in the IFN-high group achieved a better response
        to TNFi therapy [\u0394DAS28, P = 0.05, odds ratio (OR) 1.4 (95% CI 1.005,
        1.950)] than patients in the IFN-low group. The level of expression of IFN-response
        genes (IFN score) predicted a good response [European League Against Rheumatism
        (EULAR) criteria] to TNFi using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis
        (area under the curve 0.76).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIFN-response genes are significantly
        up-regulated in RA neutrophils compared with healthy controls. Higher IFN-response
        gene expression in RA neutrophils correlates with a good response to TNFi
        therapy.", "venue": "Rheumatology", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 19, "citationCount":

        endosymbiont, Wolbachia, is a major contributing factor in the development
        of chronic pathology in humans (onchocerciasis/river blindness). Recently,
        the toll\u2010like pattern recognition receptor motif of the major inflammatory
        ligands of filarial Wolbachia, membrane\u2010associated diacylated lipoproteins,
        was functionally defined in murine models of pathology, including mediation
        of neutrophil recruitment to the cornea. However, the extent to which human
        neutrophils can be activated in response to this Wolbachia pattern recognition
        motif is not known. Therefore, the responses of purified peripheral blood
        human neutrophils to a synthetic N\u2010terminal diacylated lipopeptide (WoLP)
        of filarial Wolbachia peptidoglycan\u2010associated lipoprotein (PAL) were
        characterized. WoLP exposure led to a dose\u2010dependent activation of healthy,

        WoLP exposure induced chemotaxis but not chemokinesis of neutrophils, and
        secretion of the major neutrophil chemokine, interleukin 8. WoLP also induced
        and primed the respiratory burst, and enhanced neutrophil survival by delay
        of apoptosis. These results indicate that the major inflammatory motif of
        filarial Wolbachia lipoproteins directly activates human neutrophils in vitro
        and promotes a molecular pathway by which human neutrophils are recruited
        to sites of Onchocerca parasitism.", "venue": "Parasite immunology (Print)",

        "title": "232. Interferons Alter the Response of Neutrophils to Inflammatory
        Cytokines in vitro", "abstract": "Background: Neutrophils are central to the
        initiation, progression and resolution of inflammatory diseases such as RA.
        We have previously shown that neutrophils from RA patients have a gene expression
        signature indicating activation in vivo by interferons (IFNs), and higher
        expression of IFN-response genes is associated with a good response to TNFi
        therapy. The aim of this work was to investigate the functional effects of
        IFNs on neutrophils in vitro both (i) alone, and (ii) in combination with
        inflammatory cytokines. Methods: Neutrophils were isolated from peripheral
        blood of healthy controls and incubated with Type-I IFN (IFNa) or Type-II
        IFN (IFNg) at a range of concentrations in the absence or presence of GM-CSF
        and TNFa. Apoptosis was measured at 18h by flow cytometry using annexin V/PI;
        respiratory burst was measured at hourly intervals up to 5h using luminol-enhanced
        chemiluminescence after stimulation with fMLP or PMA; changes in protein expression
        and phosphorylation were measured by Western blotting; changes in gene expression
        were measured by RNA-Seq (Illumina). Results: Neutrophils stimulated with
        IFNs in vitro underwent rapid phosphorylation of STAT proteins (5\u201330
        min), activation of IFNresponse genes (1h), and priming of the respiratory
        burst (3h), but only Type-II IFN delayed apoptosis, measured at 18h (unstimulated
        58.6% 0.6, IFNg 41.4% 4.1, P<0.05). Addition of IFNs to neutrophil suspensions
        containing GM-CSF or TNFa had a profound dose-dependent effect on the function
        of the inflammatory cytokines. Type-I IFNs abrogated the protective effect
        of GM-CSF on neutrophil apoptosis at 18h (GM-CSF 25.6% 2.7, GM-CSF\u00fe IFNa
        49.5% 1.2, P<0.01), whereas Type-II IFNs enhanced the anti-apoptotic effect
        of TNFa (TNFa 42.3% 3.3, TNFa\u00fe IFNg 27.4% 1.2, P< 0.05) and sustained
        the TNFa priming effect on the respiratory burst for up to 4h (P<0.01). Type-I
        and Type-II IFNs enhanced STAT3 phosphorylation by GM-CSF, and altered the
        activation kinetics of ERK and AKT by GM-CSF. Type-I IFN enhanced AKT phosphorylation
        in TNFa stimulated neutrophils. Conclusion: IFNs profoundly alter the functional
        effects of inflammatory cytokines on neutrophils in vitro. This may have important
        consequences in vivo during therapy with biologic drugs such as TNFi. The
        complexity and heterogeneity of inflammatory diseases such as RA, where different
        cytokines dominate or act synergistically to perpetuate systemic inflammation,
        may explain why some patients respond better to certain biologic therapies
        than others. We are currently investigating the consequences of TNFi (Infliximab)
        and JAKi (Tofacitinib) on neutrophils stimulated in vitro with IFNs, GM-CSF
        and TNFa. Disclosure statement: The authors have declared no conflicts of

        and in vivo.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES\nReports on the regulation of neutrophil
        function by IL-6 are often conflicting. Therapeutic inhibition of IL-6 in
        RA is associated with occasional neutropenia, but the mechanisms underlying
        this observation are poorly understood. This study investigated interactions
        between IL-6, the anti-IL-6 receptor agent tocilizumab (TCZ) and neutrophils
        in vitro and in vivo.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNeutrophils were isolated from healthy
        controls and incubated in vitro with pharmacologically relevant concentrations
        of IL-6 or TCZ. Neutrophils were also isolated from RA patients, including
        a cohort following TCZ therapy. Apoptosis was measured by annexin V/propidium
        iodide (PI) flow cytometry; phagocytosis was measured by incubating apoptotic
        neutrophils with THP-1-derived macrophages; chemotaxis was measured using
        cell migration through hanging-cell inserts towards IL-8 and cell surface
        proteins, including adhesion molecules CD11b (\u03b1M\u03b22 integrin) and
        CD62L (L-selectin) were measured by flow cytometry.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIL-6 (10-100
        ng/ml) did not affect the rate of neutrophil apoptosis, priming of the respiratory
        burst or adhesion molecule expression nor act as a neutrophil chemoattractant.
        However, IL-6 enhanced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
        (STAT3) activation and neutrophil migration towards IL-8. TCZ in vitro did
        not induce apoptosis or phagocytosis of neutrophils, nor did it have a significant
        effect upon apoptosis or cell surface molecule expression. Neutrophil functions
        in ex vivo neutrophils from RA patients receiving TCZ treatment were unaffected.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nTherapeutic
        blockade of IL-6, while inducing a transient neutropenia, does not directly
        affect neutrophil functions associated with host defence. TCZ-associated neutropenia
        cannot be explained by direct induction of apoptosis by TCZ, induction of
        apoptosis following depletion of IL-6, nor increased phagocytosis of neutrophils.",

        whether mucocutaneous manifestations are associated with major organ involvement
        in a UK national cohort of juvenile-onset SLE (JSLE) patients.\n\n\nMETHODS\nJSLE
        patients (n = 241) from 15 different centres whose diagnosis fulfilled four
        or more of the ACR criteria were divided into two groups: those with at least
        one ACR mucocutaneous criterion (ACR skin feature positive) and those without
        (ACR skin feature negative) at diagnosis. The relative frequency of skin involvement
        was described by the paediatric adaptation of the 2004 British Isles Lupus
        Assessment Group (pBILAG-2004) index.\n\n\nRESULTS\nOne hundred and seventy-nine
        patients (74%) had ACR-defined skin involvement with no significant demographic
        differences compared with those without. ACR skin feature negative patients
        showed greater haematological (84% vs 67%), renal (43% vs 26%) (P < 0.05)
        and neurological (16% vs 4%) involvement (P = 0.001). Forty-two per cent of
        ACR skin feature negative patients had skin involvement using pBILAG-2004,
        which included maculopapular rash (17%), non-scaring alopecia (15%), cutaneous
        vasculitis (12%) and RP (12%). ACR skin feature negative patients with moderate
        to severe skin involvement by pBILAG-2004 showed greater renal and haematological
        involvement at diagnosis and over the follow-up period (P < 0.05). Higher
        immunosuppressive drug use in the skin feature negative group was demonstrated.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPatients
        who fulfil the ACR criteria but without any of the mucocutaneous criteria
        at diagnosis have an increased risk of major organ involvement. The pBILAG-2004
        index has shown that other skin lesions may go undetected using the ACR criteria
        alone, and these lesions show a strong correlation with disease severity and
        major organ involvement.", "venue": "Rheumatology", "year": 2014, "referenceCount":

        Pathways following Neutrophil Priming", "abstract": "Neutrophils are central
        to the pathology of inflammatory diseases, where they can damage host tissue
        through release of reactive oxygen metabolites and proteases, and drive inflammation
        via secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Many cytokines, such as those generated
        during inflammation, can induce a similar \u201cprimed\u201d phenotype in
        neutrophils, but it is unknown if different cytokines utilise common or cytokine-specific
        pathways to induce these functional changes. Here, we describe the transcriptomic
        changes induced in control human neutrophils during priming in vitro with
        pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF) using RNA-seq. Priming
        led to the rapid expression of a common set of transcripts for cytokines,
        chemokines and cell surface receptors (CXCL1, CXCL2, IL1A, IL1B, IL1RA, ICAM1).
        However, 580 genes were differentially regulated by TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF
        treatment, and of these 58 were directly implicated in the control of apoptosis.
        While these two cytokines both delayed apoptosis, they induced changes in
        expression of different pro- and anti-apoptotic genes. Bioinformatics analysis
        predicted that these genes were regulated via differential activation of transcription
        factors by TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF and these predictions were confirmed using
        functional assays: inhibition of NF-\u03baB signalling abrogated the protective
        effect of TNF-\u03b1 (but not that of GM-CSF) on neutrophil apoptosis, whereas
        inhibition of JAK/STAT signalling abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of GM-CSF,
        but not that of TNF-\u03b1 (p<0.05). These data provide the first characterisation
        of the human neutrophil transcriptome following GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 priming,
        and demonstrate the utility of this approach to define functional changes
        in neutrophils following cytokine exposure. This may provide an important,
        new approach to define the molecular properties of neutrophils after in vivo
        activation during inflammation.", "venue": "PLoS ONE", "year": 2013, "referenceCount":

        Lead to Enhanced Lymphocyte Proliferation", "abstract": "Objective. Previous
        studies suggested a role for the death decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) in the pathogenesis
        of adult systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We investigated the role of DcR3
        in juvenile-onset SLE, to identify polymorphisms that might alter the function
        of this protein. Methods. DcR3 was measured in the serum of 61 patients with
        juvenile SLE. The coding region of the DcR3 gene was sequenced in 100 juvenile
        and 103 adult patients with SLE, together with 500 healthy controls. Results.
        DcR3 was elevated in the serum of juvenile patients with active SLE disease
        (440.8 \u00b1 169.1 pg/ml), compared to patients with inactive disease (122.6
        \u00b1 28.05 pg/ml; p = 0.0014) and controls (69.27 \u00b1 20.23 pg/ml; p
        = 0.0009). DNA sequencing identified 2 novel missense mutations: c.C167T (p.T56I)
        in an adult SLE patient and c.C364T (p.H122Y) in a juvenile patient. Recombinant
        proteins containing these mutations exhibited altered binding kinetics to
        FasL and they significantly increased lymphocyte proliferation, compared to
        the wild-type protein (p < 0.05). The adult patient with SLE carrying the
        p.T56I mutation had significantly increased lymphocyte proliferation compared
        to 3 SLE controls matched for age, sex, and disease severity. Conclusion.
        DcR3 may play an etiologic role in SLE through either elevated serum levels
        of wild-type DcR3 or normal levels of gain-of-function DcR3 proteins that

        of inflammatory arthritis and may predict response to therapy.", "abstract":
        "OBJECTIVES\nBiologic drugs have revolutionized the care of RA, but are expensive
        and not universally effective. To further understand the inflammatory mechanisms
        underlying RA and identify potential biomarkers predicting response to therapy,
        we measured multiple cytokine concentrations in SF of patients with inflammatory
        arthritides (IAs) and, in a subset of patients with RA, correlated this with
        response to TNF-\u03b1 inhibition.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSF from 42 RA patients and
        19 non-RA IA patients were analysed for 12 cytokines using a multiplex cytokine
        assay. Cytokines were also measured in the plasma of 16 RA patients before
        and following treatment with anti-TNF-\u03b1. Data were analysed using Mann-Whitney
        U-test, Spearman''s rank correlation and cluster analysis with the Kruskal-Wallis
        test with Dunn''s post-test analysis.\n\n\nRESULTS\nRA SF contained significantly
        elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IFN-\u03b3,
        G-CSF, GM-CSF and TNF-\u03b1 compared with other IA SF. RA patients who did
        not respond to anti-TNF therapy had elevated IL-6 in their SF pre-therapy
        (P\u2009<\u20090.05), whereas responders had elevated IL-2 and G-CSF (P\u2009<\u20090.05).
        Plasma cytokine concentrations were not significantly modulated by TNF inhibitors,
        with the exception of IL-6, which decreased after 12 weeks (P\u2009<\u20090.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCytokine
        profiles in RA SF vary with treatment and response to therapy. Cytokine concentrations
        are significantly lower in plasma than in SF and relatively unchanged by TNF
        inhibitor therapy. Concentrations of IL-6, IL-2 and G-CSF in SF may predict
        response to TNF inhibitors.", "venue": "Rheumatology", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

        "OBJECTIVE\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the pathogenesis
        of SSc. Neutrophils constitute a major source of ROS during inflammation.
        Here, we examined endogenous and stimulated ex vivo ROS production of SSc
        neutrophils compared with control neutrophils with and without prior priming
        with TNF-\u03b1.\n\n\nMETHODS\nROS generation was measured using luminol-enhanced
        chemiluminescence. Neutrophils isolated from SSc patients and healthy controls
        were unprimed or were primed with TNF-\u03b1. ROS production was stimulated
        in vitro with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and formyl-met-leu-phe
        (fMLP). To examine the effects of serum mediators on ROS generation, control
        neutrophils were also stimulated with SSc or control serum.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeutrophil
        stimulation with PMA and fMLP resulted in a greater increase in ROS generation
        in SSc neutrophils compared with controls. However, unstimulated SSc neutrophils
        generated lower levels of ROS than controls. SSc neutrophils demonstrated
        an increased response to fMLP in the absence of in vitro TNF-\u03b1 priming
        indicating priming of SSc neutrophils in vivo. SSc serum did not stimulate
        neutrophil ROS generation in vitro.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nSSc neutrophils are primed
        for ROS generation. Neutrophils binding to activated endothelium in SSc, may
        induce local production of ROS, perpetuating endothelial dysfunction and mediating
        fibrosis.", "venue": "Rheumatology", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 12, "citationCount":

        Stability and Anti-Apoptotic Function of Mcl-1", "abstract": "Mcl-1 is an
        anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that plays a key role in normal
        development, but also in pathologies such as cancer. It has some unusual properties
        compared to other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and its expression
        and function are dynamically regulated by a variety of post-transcriptional
        and post-translational processes. Of note, Mcl-1 protein has a very short
        half life, and its stability and function may be regulated by reversible phosphorylation.
        There is also evidence to suggest that it may be localized to different subcellular
        compartments. The aim of this work was to determine whether residues within
        the PEST region of Mcl-1 that may undergo reversible phosphorylation, also
        regulate its subcellular distribution. We show that EGFP:Mcl-1 localizes mainly
        to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, with some additional cytoplasmic and nuclear
        localization. The mutations, S64A, S64E, S121A, S159A, T163A and T163E did
        not significantly affect the localization of Mcl-1. However, mutation of Ser162
        to the phospho-null residue, Alanine resulted in an essentially nuclear localization,
        with some cytoplasmic but no mitochondrial localization. This mutant Mcl-1
        protein, S162A, showed significantly decreased stability and it decreased
        the ability to protect against Bak-induced apoptosis. These data identify
        a new molecular determinant of Mcl-1 function, localization and stability
        that may be important for understanding the role of this protein in disease.",

        "title": "Basic science232. Certolizumab pegol prevents pro-inflammatory alterations
        in endothelial cell function", "abstract": "Background: Cardiovascular disease
        is a major comorbidity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and a leading cause of
        death. Chronic systemic inflammation involving tumour necrosis factor alpha
        (TNF) could contribute to endothelial activation and atherogenesis. A number
        of anti-TNF therapies are in current use for the treatment of RA, including
        certolizumab pegol (CZP), (Cimzia \u00ae; UCB, Belgium). Anti-TNF therapy
        has been associated with reduced clinical cardiovascular disease risk and
        ameliorated vascular function in RA patients. However, the specific effects
        of TNF inhibitors on endothelial cell function are largely unknown. Our aim
        was to investigate the mechanisms underpinning CZP effects on TNF-activated
        human endothelial cells. Methods: Human aortic endothelial cells (HAoECs)
        were cultured in vitro and exposed to a) TNF alone, b) TNF plus CZP, or c)
        neither agent. Microarray analysis was used to examine the transcriptional
        profile of cells treated for 6 hrs and quantitative polymerase chain reaction
        (qPCR) analysed gene expression at 1, 3, 6 and 24 hrs. NF-\u03baB localization
        and I\u03baB degradation were investigated using immunocytochemistry, high
        content analysis and western blotting. Flow cytometry was conducted to detect
        microparticle release from HAoECs. Results: Transcriptional profiling revealed
        that while TNF alone had strong effects on endothelial gene expression, TNF
        and CZP in combination produced a global gene expression pattern similar to
        untreated control. The two most highly up-regulated genes in response to TNF
        treatment were adhesion molecules E-selectin and VCAM-1 (q 0.2 compared to
        control; p > 0.05 compared to TNF alone). The NF-\u03baB pathway was confirmed
        as a downstream target of TNF-induced HAoEC activation, via nuclear translocation
        of NF-\u03baB and degradation of I\u03baB, effects which were abolished by
        treatment with CZP. In addition, flow cytometry detected an increased production
        of endothelial microparticles in TNF-activated HAoECs, which was prevented
        by treatment with CZP. Conclusions: We have found at a cellular level that
        a clinically available TNF inhibitor, CZP reduces the expression of adhesion
        molecule expression, and prevents TNF-induced activation of the NF-\u03baB
        pathway. Furthermore, CZP prevents the production of microparticles by activated
        endothelial cells. This could be central to the prevention of inflammatory
        environments underlying these conditions and measurement of microparticles
        has potential as a novel prognostic marker for future cardiovascular events
        in this patient group. Disclosure statement: Y.A. received a research grant

        "abstract": "Objective. Neutrophil elastase is secreted by neutrophils during
        activation and circulates in the plasma where it can play a role in inflammation
        and fibrosis. This study examines the role of neutrophil elastase in SSc,
        a systemic CTD that is typified by vascular dysfunction, tissue fibrosis and
        inflammation. Methods. Serum neutrophil elastase and \u03b11-anti-trypsin
        concentrations were assessed in SSc patients and healthy controls by ELISA.
        Serum neutrophil elastase activity was assessed by the elastase-dependent
        conversion of methoxy-succinyl-alanyl-alanyl-prolyl-valyl-p-nitroanilide to
        p-nitroanilide using a colourimetric assay. Elastase concentration and activity
        were correlated with clinical disease features. Results. Serum neutrophil
        elastase concentration and activity were equivalent in patients and controls;
        however, in SSc serum, there was an increase in elastase activity for each
        unit of elastase concentration (P\u2009=\u20090.03). This was due to a decrease
        in serum \u03b11-anti-trypsin concentrations (P\u2009=\u20090.04). Serum elastase
        concentration (P\u2009=\u20090.03) and activity (P\u2009=\u20090.02) were
        significantly lower in RNP-positive patients and serum elastase concentrations
        were lower in ANA-positive patients (P\u2009=\u20090.003). Conclusions. Relative
        deficiency in serum \u03b11-anti-trypsin concentrations in SSc could have
        important and pathogenically relevant effects since elastase has pro-inflammatory
        and pro-fibrotic roles. Elastase inhibitors are available in clinical practice
        and could represent potential therapeutic options in SSc.", "venue": "Rheumatology",

        "abstract": "Background.\u2003Neutrophils are the predominant cell in the
        lung inflammatory infiltrate of infants with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
        bronchiolitis. Although it has previously been shown that neutrophils from
        both blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) are activated, little is understood
        about their role in response to RSV infection. This study investigated whether
        RSV proteins and mRNA are present in neutrophils from blood and BAL of infected
        infants. Methods.\u2003We obtained blood and BAL samples from 20 infants with
        severe RSV bronchiolitis and 8 healthy control infants. Neutrophil RSV F,
        G, and N proteins, RSV N genomic RNA, and messenger RNA (mRNA) were quantified.
        Results.\u2003RSV proteins were found in BAL and blood neutrophils in infants
        with RSV disease but not in neutrophils from healthy infants. BAL and blood
        neutrophils from infants with RSV disease, but not those from healthy infants,
        expressed RSV N genomic RNA, indicating uptake of whole virus; 17 of 20 BAL
        and 8 of 9 blood neutrophils from patients expressed RSV N mRNA. Conclusions.\u2003This
        work shows, for the first time, the presence of RSV proteins and mRNA transcripts
        within BAL and blood neutrophils from infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis.",

        "Background Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is central to the pathophysiological
        process of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whether as soluble cytokine or membrane-expressed
        pro-TNF (mTNF). Objectives To determine whether neutrophils, which can express
        TNF, are activated in the blood of patients with RA compared with healthy
        controls. To investigate, by focusing on mTNF expression, if the functions
        of RA neutrophils change in response to therapeutic TNF inhibition. Methods
        TNF was measured by flow cytometry and qPCR in neutrophils from 20 patients
        with RA before and after the start of TNF inhibitor therapy. Apoptosis was
        measured by morphology, and western blotting of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins
        in cell lysates. Nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation was determined
        by western blotting of phosphorylated NF-\u03baB (p65). Results Before treatment
        RA neutrophils exhibited increased TNF mRNA expression, elevated mTNF levels
        and NF-\u03baB activity compared with controls. They also underwent delayed
        apoptosis as shown by altered expression of anti- and proapoptotic proteins,
        such as Mcl-1 and caspases. Neutrophil TNF expression returned to baseline
        levels during successful treatment with anti-TNF biological agents, and there
        was a close correlation between clinical disease improvement and changes in
        neutrophil function. Conclusions Neutrophils express elevated levels of TNF
        in RA and the transcription factor, NF-\u03baB, a target of TNF, is activated.
        This mechanism could lead to a self-sustained inflammatory process. These
        data point to an important role of neutrophils in the abnormal TNF signalling
        pathways activated in RA and provide new evidence that neutrophils actively
        contribute to altered cytokine signalling in inflammatory diseases.", "venue":

        interleukin 6 trans-signalling: a novel target for systemic sclerosis?", "abstract":
        "Objectives Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a connective tissue disease associated
        with significant morbidity and mortality and generally inadequate treatment.
        Endothelial cell activation and apoptosis are thought to be pivotal in the
        pathogenesis of this disease, but the mechanisms that mediate this remain
        unknown. Methods Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells were cultured
        with healthy control neutrophils in the presence of 25% healthy control or
        SSc serum for 24 h. Apoptosis was measured by annexin V-FITC binding and endothelial
        cell activation was measured using an allophycocyanin-conjugated E-selectin
        antibody. Fluorescence was quantified and localised using confocal microscopy.
        Results SSc serum resulted in significantly increased apoptosis (p=0.006)
        and E-selectin expression (p=0.00004) in endothelial cells compared with control
        serum, effects that were critically dependent on the presence of neutrophils.
        Recombinant interleukin 6 (IL-6) reproduced these findings. Immunodepletion
        of IL-6 and the use of an IL-6 neutralising antibody decreased the effect
        of SSc serum on E-selectin expression. Soluble gp130, which specifically blocks
        IL-6 trans-signalling, negated the effect of SSc serum on both E-selectin
        expression and apoptosis. Conclusions SSc serum induces endothelial cell activation
        and apoptosis in endothelial cell-neutrophil co-cultures, mediated largely
        by IL-6 and dependent on the presence of neutrophils. Together with other
        pathologically relevant effects of IL-6, these data justify further exploration
        of IL-6 as a therapeutic target in SSc.", "venue": "Annals of the Rheumatic

        in preterm and term infants with RSV bronchiolitis than control infants (p<0.025)
        but similar amounts of MPO. BAL fluid neutrophils from infants with RSV bronchiolitis
        had greater amounts of CD11b and MPO than blood neutrophils and BAL fluid
        neutrophils from controls (p<0.01). Blood neutrophils from term infants with
        RSV bronchiolitis had less total TLR4 protein than preterm infants with RSV
        bronchiolitis (p\u200a=\u200a0.005), and both had less than controls (p<0.04).
        Total TLR4 for each group was greater in BAL fluid neutrophils than in blood
        neutrophils. Blood neutrophils from preterm infants with RSV bronchiolitis
        had greater TLR4 mRNA expression than term infants with RSV bronchiolitis
        (p\u200a=\u200a0.005) who had similar expression to controls (p\u200a=\u200a0.625).
        Conclusions: In infants with severe RSV bronchiolitis, neutrophil activation
        starts in the blood and progresses as they are recruited into the airways.
        Total neutrophil TLR4 remains low in both compartments. TLR4 mRNA expression
        is unimpaired. This suggests that neutrophil TLR4 expression is deficient
        in these infants, which may explain why they develop severe RSV bronchiolitis.",

        "title": "The role of neutrophil apoptosis in juvenile-onset systemic lupus
        erythematosus.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nAccumulation of apoptotic cells may
        lead to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through a breakdown
        in immune tolerance. Altered neutrophil apoptosis may contribute to nuclear
        autoantigen exposure, ultimately leading to autoantibody generation. This
        study aimed to determine whether neutrophil apoptosis is altered in patients
        with juvenile-onset SLE as compared with controls.\n\n\nMETHODS\nApoptosis
        was measured in neutrophils from patients with juvenile-onset SLE (n=12),
        adult-onset SLE (n=6), and pediatric patients with inflammatory (n=12) and
        noninflammatory (n=12) conditions. Annexin V staining and flow cytometry were
        used to determine neutrophil apoptosis. Proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins
        were measured in sera and in neutrophil cell lysates.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNeutrophil
        apoptosis was significantly increased in patients with juvenile-onset SLE
        as compared with the noninflammatory controls at time 0. Incubation of neutrophils
        with sera from patients with juvenile-onset SLE further increased neutrophil
        apoptosis as compared with incubation with sera from pediatric controls. Concentrations
        of TRAIL and FasL were significantly increased in sera from patients with
        juvenile-onset SLE, whereas interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and
        granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) were significantly
        decreased. Addition of GM-CSF to sera from patients with juvenile-onset SLE
        significantly decreased neutrophil apoptosis as compared with juvenile-onset
        SLE sera alone. The expression of proapoptotic proteins (caspase 3, Fas, and
        FADD) was elevated in juvenile-onset SLE neutrophils, whereas the expression
        of antiapoptotic proteins (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1 and 2 and X-linked
        inhibitor of apoptosis) was decreased. Neutrophil apoptosis correlated with
        biomarkers of disease activity (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and double-stranded
        DNA concentration) and the British Isles Lupus Assessment Group disease activity
        score.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nOur data demonstrate an imbalance in proapoptotic
        and antiapoptotic factors in both neutrophils and sera from patients with
        juvenile-onset SLE. This imbalance results in increased neutrophil apoptosis
        in these patients. Correlations with markers of disease activity indicate
        that altered neutrophil apoptosis in juvenile-onset SLE patients may play
        a pathogenic role in this condition.", "venue": "Arthritis & Rheumatism",

        "title": "The dual effects of TNFalpha on neutrophil apoptosis are mediated
        via differential effects on expression of Mcl-1 and Bfl-1.", "abstract": "Neutrophils
        have a very short half-life in the circulation, undergoing rapid death by
        apoptosis, but a number of agents can either delay or accelerate the rate
        at which these cells undergo death. TNFalpha can exert opposing, concentration-dependent
        effects on neutrophils to either accelerate their apoptosis or enhance their
        survival. We show that TNFalpha greatly increases the rate of turnover of
        Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein that plays a key role in neutrophil survival.
        In contrast to Mcl-1 turnover in control- or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
        factor (GM-CSF)-treated neutrophils that occurs via the proteasome, TNFalpha-accelerated
        Mcl-1 turnover occurs via activation of caspases. Mcl-1-depleted cells thus
        have accelerated rates of apoptosis. While TNFalpha had no effect on MCL-1
        transcription, it induced expression of another antiapoptotic molecule, BFL-1.
        Low concentrations of TNFalpha (<or=1 ng/mL) stimulated BFL-1 expression,
        whereas higher concentrations (>or=10 ng/mL) triggered caspase-dependent acceleration
        of Mcl-1 turnover. These opposing effects on 2 separate antiapoptotic systems
        of neutrophils explain the divergent effects of TNFalpha on neutrophil apoptosis
        and have important implications for understanding how TNFalpha may affect

        cerevisiae mannan was assessed for its effects on human peripheral blood neutrophils,
        adherent monocytes, and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM).\n\n\nRESULTS\nMannan
        caused dose-related increased survival of CD Escherichia coli HM605 within
        adherent monocytes from 24% +/- 10.5% (control) to 114% +/- 22.7% with mannan
        1 mg/mL at 2 hours (mean +/- SEM, n = 9; P = .0002). Electron microscopy showed
        E coli HM605 surviving and probably replicating within macrophage vesicles.
        Mannan (1 mg/mL) inhibited the respiratory burst in neutrophils and monocytes
        (both P = .002) and bacterial killing within MDM (P < .001). E coli survival
        was increased within macrophages from TLR4(-/-) (126% +/- 3.5% survival at
        2 hours) and MyD88(-/-) (134.8% +/- 6.5%) mice compared with wild-type mice
        (both P < .0001). Mannan had no additional effect, showing that TLR4 and MyD88
        are involved in bacterial killing by macrophages and its inhibition by mannan.
        Putative CD-associated micro-organisms were screened for the ASCA mannan epitope
        by Galanthus nivalis lectin (GNA) blotting. ASCA epitope was expressed by
        Candida albicans and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis but not by Mycobacterium
        tuberculosis or E coli. Supernatants from M paratuberculosis culture inhibited
        killing of E coli HM605 by adherent human monocytes and murine macrophages.
        The inhibitory activity was removed by GNA-affinity chromatography.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSuppression

        "title": "Replication of Colonic Crohn''s Disease Mucosal Escherichia coli
        Isolates within Macrophages and Their Susceptibility to Antibiotics", "abstract":
        "ABSTRACT There is increasing evidence that Escherichia coli organisms are
        important in Crohn''s disease (CD) pathogenesis. In CD tissue they are found
        within macrophages, and the adherent-invasive CD ileal E. coli isolate LF82
        can replicate inside macrophage phagolysosomes. This study investigates replication
        and antibiotic susceptibility of CD colonic E. coli isolates inside macrophages.
        Replication of CD colonic E. coli within J774-A1 murine macrophages and human
        monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) was assessed by culture and lysis after
        gentamicin killing of noninternalized bacteria and verified by electron microscopy
        (EM). All seven CD colonic isolates tested replicated within J774-A1 macrophages
        by 3 h (6.36-fold \u00b1 0.7-fold increase; n = 7 isolates) to a similar extent
        to CD ileal E. coli LF82 (6.8-fold \u00b1 0.8-fold) but significantly more
        than control patient isolates (5.2-fold \u00b1 0.25-fold; n = 6; P = 0.006)
        and E. coli K-12 (1.0-fold \u00b1 0.1-fold; P < 0.0001). Replication of CD
        E. coli HM605 within HMDM (3.9-fold \u00b1 0.7-fold) exceeded that for K-12
        (1.4-fold \u00b1 0.2-fold; P = 0.03). EM showed replicating E. coli within
        macrophage vacuoles. Killing of HM605 within J774-A1 macrophages following
        a 3-h incubation with antibiotics at published peak serum concentrations (Cmax)
        was as follows: for ciprofloxacin, 99.5% \u00b1 0.2%; rifampin, 85.1% \u00b1
        6.6%; tetracycline, 62.8% \u00b1 6.1%; clarithromycin, 62.1% \u00b1 5.6% (all
        P < 0.0001); sulfamethoxazole, 61.3% \u00b1 7.0% (P = 0.0007); trimethoprim,
        56.3% \u00b1 3.4% (P < 0.0001); and azithromycin, 41.0% \u00b1 10.5% (P =
        0.03). Ampicillin was not effective against intracellular E. coli. Triple
        antibiotic combinations were assessed at 10% Cmax, with ciprofloxacin, tetracycline,
        and trimethoprim causing 97% \u00b1 0.0% killing versus 86% \u00b1 2.0% for
        ciprofloxacin alone. Colonic mucosa-associated E. coli, particularly CD isolates,
        replicate within macrophages. Clinical trials are indicated to assess the
        efficacy of a combination antibiotic therapy targeting intramacrophage E.

        is commonly found in the airways of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease (COPD), both during stable disease and during exacerbations. Neutrophils
        are also found in large numbers in sputum from patients with COPD, which also
        contains released neutrophil products such as elastase. Why H. influenzae
        colonizes the lungs of patients with COPD in the presence of such large numbers
        of infiltrating neutrophils is not known. We set out to determine if abnormal
        interactions between H. influenzae and neutrophils could impact on COPD pathology.
        Noncapsulate H. influenzae clinical isolates were incubated in vitro with
        neutrophils from healthy volunteers, and respiratory burst activity, cytokine
        and chemokine production, phagocytosis and killing of bacteria, and neutrophil
        apoptosis and necrosis were measured. Neutrophil morphology was determined
        in sputum samples. H. influenzae were phagocytosed by neutrophils, thereby
        activating a respiratory burst and the secretion of the neutrophil chemoattractant
        IL-8. However, rather than kill the bacteria, the neutrophils themselves were
        killed (largely via necrosis) and released their granule contents into the
        extracellular environment. Neutrophil-derived IL-8, generated after the interaction
        of H. influenzae with neutrophils, may result in the further infiltration
        of neutrophils into the lungs, thereby amplifying the inflammatory response.
        However, the infiltrating neutrophils fail to kill the bacteria and instead
        release tissue-damaging products into the lung as they undergo necrosis. These

        "Background & Aims: Crohn\u2019s disease (CD) is mimicked by inherited phagocyte
        disorders and is associated with circulating antibodies against yeast mannan
        (antiSaccharomyces cerevisiae antibody; ASCA). We speculated that mannans
        might impair phagocyte function. Methods: S cerevisiae mannan was assessed
        for its effects on human peripheral blood neutrophils, adherent monocytes,
        and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM). Results: Mannan caused dose-related
        increased survival of CD Escherichia coli HM605 within adherent monocytes
        from 24% 10.5% (control) to 114% 22.7% with mannan 1 mg/mL at 2 hours (mean
        SEM, n 9; P .0002). Electron microscopy showed E coli HM605 surviving and
        probably replicating within macrophage vesicles. Mannan (1 mg/mL) inhibited
        the respiratory burst in neutrophils and monocytes (both P .002) and bacterial
        killing within MDM (P < .001). E coli survival was increased within macrophages
        from TLR4 / (126% 3.5% survival at 2 hours) and MyD88 / (134.8% 6.5%) mice
        compared with wildtype mice (both P < .0001). Mannan had no additional effect,
        showing that TLR4 and MyD88 are involved in bacterial killing by macrophages
        and its inhibition by mannan. Putative CD-associated micro-organisms were
        screened for the ASCA mannan epitope byGalanthus nivalis lectin (GNA) blotting.
        ASCA epitope was expressed by Candida albicans and Mycobacterium paratuberculosis
        but not by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or E coli. Supernatants from M paratuberculosis
        culture inhibited killing of E coli HM605 by adherent human monocytes and

        cells and die by apoptosis, but when recruited into tissues, their apoptosis
        is delayed, and they survive for much longer time periods. In inflammatory
        diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), this delayed apoptosis may lead
        to increased tissue damage and a failure of the inflammation to resolve. However,
        there are conflicting reports in the literature as to whether neutrophil apoptosis
        is delayed or accelerated in rheumatoid joints. In this report, we show that
        neutrophils isolated from the ynovial fluid (SF) of patients with RA show
        accelerated rates of apoptosis when incubated ex vivo and that SF, despite
        containing a variety of antiapoptotic cytokines, is proapoptotic. Paradoxically,
        levels of the key neutrophil survival protein Mcl\u20101 are elevated in freshly
        isolated SF neutrophils compared with matched peripheral blood samples from
        the same patients, indicating that delayed neutrophil apoptosis has been signaled
        in vivo as the cells enter the joints. However, when SF was added to neutrophils
        and incubated under hypoxia (1% O2), conditions known to exist in vivo within
        joints, the SF was antiapoptotic. These data reveal that the rheumatoid synovial
        joint contains a complex mixture of pro\u2010 and antiapoptotic factors and
        that the low, local oxygen tensions that exist within these joints can exert
        profound effects on neutrophil survival. These experiments also highlight
        the importance of performing in vitro experiments under laboratory conditions
        that closely mimic those that occur in vivo; otherwise, misleading conclusions

        "title": "Sodium Salicylate Promotes Neutrophil Apoptosis by Stimulating Caspase-Dependent
        Turnover of Mcl-11", "abstract": "Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic member of the
        Bcl-2 family of proteins that plays a central role in cell survival of neutrophils
        and other cells. The protein is unusual among family members in that it has
        a very short half-life of 2\u20133 h. In this report, we show that sodium
        salicylate (at 10 mM) greatly enhances the rate at which neutrophils undergo
        apoptosis and, in parallel, greatly accelerates the turnover rate of Mcl-1,
        decreasing its half-life to only 90 min. Whereas constitutive and GM-CSF-modified
        Mcl-1 turnover is regulated by the proteasome, the accelerated sodium salicylate-induced
        Mcl-1 turnover is mediated largely via caspases. Sodium salicylate resulted
        in rapid activation of caspase-3, -8, -9, and -10, and salicylate-accelerated
        Mcl-1 turnover was partly blocked by caspase inhibitors. Sodium salicylate
        also induced dramatic changes in the activities of members of the MAPK family
        implicated in Mcl-1 turnover and apoptosis. For example, sodium salicylate
        blocked GM-CSF-stimulated Erk and Akt activation, but resulted in rapid and
        sustained activation of p38-MAPK, an event mimicked by okadaic acid that also
        accelerates Mcl-1 turnover and neutrophil apoptosis. These data thus shed
        important new insights into the dynamic and highly regulated control of neutrophil
        apoptosis that is effected by modification in the rate of Mcl-1 turnover.",

        "title": "arthritis . synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid immunoglobulin
        aggregates isolated from the of neutrophils by soluble and insoluble Role
        of Fc gamma receptors in the activation", "abstract": "Objectives-Synovial
        fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis contains both soluble and insoluble
        immunoglobulin aggregates which activate reactive oxidant production in human
        neutrophils. The objectives were to determine the roles played by Fc-y receptors
        in activation of neutrophils by these complexes. Methods-Pronase treatment
        was used to remove Fc-yRIII from the neutrophil surface and blocking monoclonal
        antibodies were used to prevent the binding of complexes to Fc-yRII and FcyRIII.
        Results-When FcyRIII was removed from the cell surface by pronase treatment,
        activation by the soluble aggregates did not occur [mean (SD) inhibition 89
        (16)%, n = 6] whereas activation via the insoluble aggregates was less affected
        [34 (16)%, n = 6]. Blocking the binding to Fc-yRIII with antibodies decreased
        activation in response to the soluble aggregates [mean (SD) inhibition 71
        (22)%, n =8] but again had a lower effect on activation by the insoluble aggregates
        [40 (17)%, n = 9]. When binding to FcyRII was blocked, activation via the
        soluble aggregates was substantially inhibited [mean (SD) 93 (13)%, n = 8]
        whereas that via the insoluble aggregates was inhibited to a much lesser extent
        [28 (38)%, n = 9]. When Fc-yRII and III were simultaneously blocked, activation
        by the insoluble aggregates was only inhibited by 450/o [(19), n = 5]. Conclusion-These
        data thus indicate that activation ofhuman neutrophils by soluble immunoglobulin
        aggregates from rheumatoid synovial fluid occurs via cooperative occupancy
        of both Fc-yRII and III: perturbation of binding to either of these receptor
        classes will abrogate activation. (Ann Rheum Dis 1994; 53: 515-520) In addition
        to their crucial role in host defence, it is appreciated that inappropriate
        infiltration and activation of neutrophils into tissues can result in tissue
        damage in inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Much evidence
        now exists in previous reports to suggest that neutrophil activation has occurred
        within synovial joints''7and hence it is of potential pharmacological interest
        to understand the molecular processes which activate and regulate neutrophil
        function within such diseased joints. The major neutrophilactivating factors
        within synovial fluid appear to be immune complexes/immunoglobulin aggregates8-12
        which are capable of activating neutrophils via interactions with their plasma
        membrane Fc receptors. Neutrophils possess receptors recognising the Fc portions
        ofIgG and IgA`3 ''4 and of these the Fcy receptors are the most clearly defined.
        Three types of FcyR can be present.''5 Fc-yRI (CD64) is not present on blood
        neutrophils but its expression is up-regulated upon exposure to cytokines
        such as -y-interferon''6; this receptor is also detected at low levels on
        neutrophils isolated from the synovial fluid of some patients with rheumatoid
        arthritis.5 FcyRII (CD32) and Fc-yRIII (CD 16) are both present on the surface
        of blood neutrophils at levels of about 7-15 000 and 100-200 000 per cell,
        respectively.''7 There is much debate as to the role of Fc-yRII and FcyRIII
        in neutrophil function. Neither of these bind monomeric IgG, but they bind
        dimers, trimers, immune complexes and opsonised particles. It is currently
        believed that FcyRIII binds complexes, but this binding does not activate
        phagocytosis, degranulation or the respiratory burst: Fc-yRII occupancy, however,
        is believed to result in neutrophil activation.''8 ''9 Unlike Fc,yRII, Fc-yRIII
        is held on the neutrophil plasma membrane via a glycerophosphoinositol anchor
        which is cleaved upon activation,20 and may also be released experimentally
        via treatment of neutrophils with pronase, elastase and phospholipase C. We
        have recently shown that synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis
        contains both soluble and insoluble immunoglobulin aggregates which are capable
        of activating reactive oxidant production by neutrophils.9 However, several
        lines of evidence indicate that these aggregates activate neutrophils via
        distinct mechanisms. Firstly, the soluble aggregates only activate neutrophils
        that have been primed in vivo or in vitro by GM-CSF or -y-interferon. Secondly,
        the soluble aggregates activate a transient (2-4 minutes) burst of oxidase
        function in primed cells whereas the insoluble aggregates stimulate a slower

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nNeutrophils are known to express and release a large
        number of proinflammatory cytokines when they are stimulated by inflammatory
        stimuli. The objective of this study was to determine whether neutrophils
        express oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the interleukin-6 family of cytokines
        that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint disease.\n\n\nMETHODS\nNeutrophils
        were isolated from the blood of healthy volunteer donors and from the blood
        and synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). OSM levels
        were measured in cell extracts and in culture supernatants by Western blotting.
        Total RNA was isolated from control and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
        factor (GM-CSF)-treated neutrophils, and OSM messenger RNA levels were quantified
        by hybridization of a radiolabeled probe.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGM-CSF stimulated
        a rapid and transient expression and release of OSM from blood neutrophils,
        which was more rapid than the expression and release from blood monocytes.
        A 28-kd protein was identified in cell extracts, but an additional 25-kd isoform
        was detected in culture supernatants. Synovial fluid neutrophils could not
        be stimulated to express OSM, but this cytokine was detected in cell-free
        supernatants at various levels.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nBlood neutrophils can be
        stimulated to express and rapidly release large quantities of OSM. We propose
        that this important cytokine is released from neutrophils as they infiltrate
        rheumatoid joints and, thus, contribute to the complex cytokine network that
        characterizes RA.", "venue": "Arthritis & Rheumatism", "year": 2004, "referenceCount":

        Inhibition Delay Neutrophil Apoptosis by Increasing the Stability of Mcl-1*",
        "abstract": "Human neutrophils normally have a very short half-life and die
        by apoptosis. Cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
        factor (GM-CSF) can delay this apoptosis via increases in the cellular levels
        of Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family with a rapid turnover
        rate. Here we have shown that inhibition of the proteasome (a) decreases the
        rate of Mcl-1 turnover within neutrophils and (b) significantly delays apoptosis.
        This led us to determine whether GM-CSF could enhance neutrophil survival
        by altering the rate of Mcl-1 turnover. Addition of GM-CSF to neutrophils
        enhanced Mcl-1 stability and delayed apoptosis by signaling pathways requiring
        PI3K/Akt and p44/42 Erk/Mek, because inhibitors of these pathways completely
        abrogated the GM-CSF-mediated effect on both Mcl-1 stability and apoptosis
        delay. Conversely, induction of Mcl-1 hyperphosphorylation by the phosphatase
        inhibitor, okadaic acid, significantly accelerated both Mcl-1 turnover and
        apoptosis. Neither the calpain inhibitor, carbobenzoxy-valinyl-phenylalaninal,
        nor the pan caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethylketone, had
        any effect on Mcl-1 stability under these conditions. These observations indicate
        that profound changes in the rate of neutrophil apoptosis following cytokine
        signaling occur via dynamic changes in the rate of Mcl-1 turnover via the

        "title": "arthritis . neutrophils from patients with rheumatoid Receptor expression
        in synovial fluid", "abstract": "Objectives-The aim of this study was to determine
        if neutrophils isolated from the blood and synovial fluid of patients with
        rheumatoid arthritis had patterns of receptor expression resembling those
        of blood neutrophils from controls which had been activated and primed in
        vitro. Methods-Fluorescence activated cell sorting was used to measure receptor
        expression in paired blood and synovial fluid neutrophils from patients and
        in control neutrophils exposed to phorbol myristate acetate and granulocytemacrophage
        colony stimulating factor. Results-There was no significant difference in
        the patterns of receptor expression in blood neutrophils from patients and
        healthy controls, but neutrophils in the synovial fluid had been primed and
        activated within the joint. About 50% of rheumatoid synovial fluid neutrophil
        samples expressed Fcy RI, a high affinity receptor for monomeric IgG, which
        is only expressed in neutrophils exposed to cytokines. Conclusions-Synovial
        fluid neutrophils are activated and primed within the inflamed joint and hence
        their ability to respond to activating factors such as immune complexes will
        be modulated. As the expression of Fcy RI requires active biosynthesis, this
        work indicates that selective gene activation occurs when neutrophils are
        recruited into rheumatoid joints. (Ann Rheum Dis 1993; 52: 354-359) Department

        Correspondence to: Dr Edwards. Accepted for publication 30 December 1992 During
        the active phase of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), neutrophils constitute between
        60 and 80% of the total cell population of synovial fluid.'' Neutrophils are
        cells of considerable cytotoxic potential and their inappropriate activation
        has been implicated in the pathogenesis of RA, perhaps through the generation
        of reactive oxygen metabolites such as hydrogen peroxide.2 Tissue damage may
        be promoted indirectly by the extracellular leakage of toxic products from
        accumulated neutrophils.3 Indeed, oxidant damaged products are present in
        synovial fluid4 and the oxidase function of neutrophils isolated from synovial
        fluid has been downregulated, indicating that reactive oxidant generation
        has been activated in vivo.5 Furthermore, synovial fluid from patients with
        RA contains myeloperoxidase in a molecular form indicating that it has been
        co-secreted from neutrophils concomitant with reactive oxidants.6 The mechanisms
        by which neutrophils are activated within rheumatoid joints and the synovial
        fluid factors which result in such activation are incompletely defined. The
        function of neutrophils in vivo is regulated by the levels of expression of
        specific plasma membrane receptors including those for complement components
        (CR1 and CR3) and IgG molecules (Fc RI, II, and III). On cellular activation
        the complement receptors are upregulated whereas Fc RIII is shed from the
        surface of the cell7 8: Fc RII expression remains constant after cell activation
        whereas Fc RI is only expressed after in vitro culture of the neutrophils
        with interferon y.'' Neutrophil function is also regulated by the activities
        of cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF),
        tumour necrosis factor, and interferon y which prime the cells into a state
        of enhanced responsiveness. On priming, reactive oxidant production is increased
        together with the levels of expression of several surface receptors.''0-12
        As such cytokines have been found in the synovial fluid of patients with RA,''3
        it is likely that these or other similarly acting agents will upregulate neutrophil
        function in situ within inflamed joints. In this work we studied the expression
        of neutrophil plasma membrane receptors using monoclonal antibodies and fluorescence
        activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis in paired bloodstream and synovial
        fluid neutrophils from patients with RA. We propose that the changes in membrane
        expression observed in synovial fluid neutrophils may be caused by the presence
        of activating factors, perhaps functioning in combination with cytokines within
        the synovial fluid, to modulate neutrophil responsiveness. Subjects and methods",

        "title": "The Mitochondrial Network of Human Neutrophils: Role in Chemotaxis,
        Phagocytosis, Respiratory Burst Activation, and Commitment to Apoptosis 1",
        "abstract": "It is commonly assumed that human neutrophils possess few, if
        any, functional mitochondria and that they do not depend on these organelles
        for cell function. We have used the fluorescent mitochondrial indicators,
        JC-1, MitoTracker Red, and dihydrorhodamine 123 to show that live neutrophils
        possess a complex mitochondrial network that extends through the cytoplasm.
        The membrane potential of these mitochondria was rapidly (within 2 min) disrupted
        by the addition of FCCP (IC50 = 20 nM), but not by the Fo-ATPase inhibitor,
        oligomycin (at up to 7 \u03bcg/ml). However, inhibition of mitochondrial function
        with both agents resulted in cell shape changes. Neither activation of the
        respiratory burst nor phagocytosis of either latex particles or serum-opsonized
        Staphylococcus aureus was affected by the addition of FCCP or oligomycin.
        However, FCCP inhibited chemotaxis at concentrations that paralleled disruption
        of mitochondrial membrane potential. Furthermore, prolonged (2-h) incubation
        with oligomycin resulted in an impaired ability to activate a respiratory
        burst and also inhibited chemotaxis. These observations indicate that intact
        mitochondrial function is required to sustain some neutrophil functions, but
        not for the rapid initiation of the respiratory burst or phagocytosis. Loss
        of mitochondrial membrane potential was a very early marker for commitment
        of neutrophils into apoptosis and preceded the appearance of phosphatidylserine
        on the cell surface. However, inhibition of mitochondrial function did not
        accelerate the rate of neutrophil apoptosis. These data shed important insights
        into the hitherto unrecognized importance of mitochondria in the function
        of neutrophils during infection and inflammation.", "venue": "Journal of Immunology",

        "abstract": "ABSTRACT Ovine neutrophils spontaneously underwent apoptosis
        during culture in vitro, as assessed by morphological changes and exposure
        of annexin V binding sites on their cell surfaces. The addition of conditioned
        medium from concanavalin A-treated ovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells
        (PBMC) could partially protect against this progression into apoptosis, but
        dexamethasone and sodium butyrate could not. Actinomycin D accelerated the
        rate at which ovine neutrophils underwent apoptosis. Neutrophils isolated
        from sheep experimentally infected with Anaplasma phagocytophilum showed significantly
        delayed apoptosis during culture ex vivo, and the addition of conditioned
        medium from PBMC to these cells could not delay apoptosis above the protective
        effects observed after in vivo infection. The ability of neutrophils from
        A. phagocytophilum-infected sheep to activate a respiratory burst was increased
        compared to the activity measured in neutrophils from uninfected sheep, but
        chemotaxis was decreased in neutrophils from infected sheep. These data are
        the first demonstration that in vivo infection with A. phagocytophilum results
        in changes in rates of apoptosis of infected immune cells. This may help explain
        how these bacteria replicate in these normally short-lived cells.", "venue":

        "OBJECTIVE\nTo investigate a potential interaction between neutrophils and
        T cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), by defining the optimal conditions for
        induction of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on
        peripheral blood neutrophils in vitro and investigating the capacity for neutrophils
        to express class II MHC molecules in RA.\n\n\nMETHODS\nSurface expression
        of class II MHC and costimulatory molecules by peripheral blood and synovial
        fluid (SF) neutrophils obtained from healthy controls and patients with RA
        was measured by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Intracellular
        class II MHC protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) were detected by Western blotting
        and Northern blotting, respectively.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFreshly isolated peripheral
        blood neutrophils from controls did not express surface class II MHC; expression
        was induced by culture with appropriate cytokines. Freshly isolated peripheral
        blood neutrophils from patients with RA expressed mRNA, but there was no surface
        expression of class II MHC. Freshly isolated SF neutrophils from patients
        with RA contained high levels of class II MHC mRNA, did not express surface
        class II MHC, but did have large intracellular amounts of this protein as
        detected by Western blotting. After culture for 20 hours in vitro, SF neutrophils
        from RA patients expressed large amounts of surface class II MHC but very
        low levels of costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86. Fluorescence microscopy
        localized surface class II MHC to discrete areas on the neutrophil. Class
        II MHC-expressing neutrophils stimulated T cell proliferation.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nPeripheral
        blood neutrophils from patients with RA but not healthy controls express class
        II MHC mRNA. SF neutrophils in RA synthesize and express large amounts of
        class II MHC but not costimulatory molecules. This might underlie a novel
        interaction with T cells that is important in terms of disease pathology.",

        phagocytosis, bacterial killing, and responses to immune complexes.", "abstract":
        "OBJECTIVE\nTo determine the roles played by the neutrophil Fcgamma receptor
        type II (FcgammaRII) (CD32) and FcgammaRIIIb (CD16) in phagocytosis, bacterial
        killing, and activation by immune complexes (ICs) and to test the hypothesis
        that inhibition of pathologic effector neutrophil function is possible without
        compromising host defense.\n\n\nMETHODS\nReceptor function was probed by enzymic
        removal of FcgammaRIIIb from the cell surface and by use of Fab/F(ab'')(2)
        fragments of monoclonal antibodies to block receptor-ligand binding. Cells
        were challenged with (a) serum-opsonized Staphylococcus aureus, (b) serum-
        and IgG-opsonized latex particles, and (c) synthetic soluble and insoluble
        ICs to mimic bacterial and inflammatory stimuli.\n\n\nRESULTS\nPhosphatidylinositol-phospholipase
        C treatment removed >97% of surface FcgammaRIIIb from neutrophils previously
        treated with tumor necrosis factor alpha to mobilize intracellular stores
        of receptor. This treatment profoundly inhibited activation of primed neutrophils
        by soluble ICs of the type found in diseased rheumatoid joints, but had no
        effect on phagocytosis and killing of serum-opsonized S aureus.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFcgammaRIIIb
        plays a major role in the secretion of toxic products in response to ICs,
        but little or no role in the phagocytosis and killing of serum-opsonized bacteria.
        The selective suppression of effector neutrophil function is therefore possible.
        FcgammaRIIIb, or its intracellular signaling pathway, is a potential therapeutic
        target in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, because disruption
        of its function should decrease inflammatory tissue damage, but not jeopardize
        host protection against infection.", "venue": "Arthritis & Rheumatism", "year":

        factor receptor/Raf-1-dependent mechanism.", "abstract": "Bile acids have
        been implicated in biliary tract carcinogenesis, in part, by activating the
        epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Overexpression of Mcl-1, a potent
        antiapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, has also been reported in cholangiocarcinomas.
        Because receptor tyrosine kinases like EGFR may modulate antiapoptotic protein
        expression, we examined the hypothesis that bile acids modulate Mcl-1 expression
        levels via EGFR. Deoxycholate increased cellular Mcl-1 protein in a concentration-dependent
        manner. The deoxycholate-mediated increase of cellular Mcl-1 protein was blocked
        equally by EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors or an EGFR-neutralizing antibody.
        Although inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinases did not attenuate
        the deoxycholate-associated increase in Mcl-1 protein, the Raf-1 inhibitor,
        BAY 37-9751, effectively blocked the cellular increase of this protein. Neither
        Mcl-1 transcriptional activity nor its mRNA stability was altered by deoxycholate
        treatment. However, Mcl-1 protein stability was increased by bile acid treatment,
        an effect duplicated by proteasome inhibition. Deoxycholate prolongation of
        Mcl-1 turnover was blocked by either EGFR inhibitors or the Raf-1 inhibitor.
        Whereas the deoxycholate-induced increase in Mcl-1 reduced Fas-mediated apoptosis,
        the Raf-1 inhibitor potentiated Fas apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that
        bile acids block Mcl-1 protein degradation via activation of an EGFR/Raf-1
        cascade resulting in its cellular accumulation. Raf-1 inhibitors block this
        increase of Mcl-1 and render the cells more susceptible to apoptosis, a potential
        therapeutic strategy for cholangiocarcinomas.", "venue": "Cancer Research",

        both soluble and insoluble immune complexes that can activate infiltrating
        immune cells such as neutrophils. Objectives: To determine if these different
        complexes activate neutrophils through similar or different receptor signalling
        pathways. In particular, to determine the circumstances which result in the
        secretion of tissue damaging reactive oxygen metabolites and granule enzymes.
        Methods: Blood neutrophils were incubated with synthetic soluble and insoluble
        immune complexes and the ability to generate reactive oxidants tested by luminescence
        or spectrophotometric assays that distinguished between intracellular and
        extracellular production. Degranulation of myeloperoxidase and lactoferrin
        was determined by western blotting. The roles of Fc\u03b3RII (CD32) and Fc\u03b3RIIIb
        (CD16) were determined by incubation with Fab/F(ab`)2 fragments before activation.
        The effect of cytokine priming was determined by incubation with GM-CSF. Results:
        Insoluble immune complexes activated unprimed neutrophils, but most of the
        oxidants produced were intracellular. This activation required Fc\u03b3RIIIb,
        but not Fc\u03b3RII function. Soluble complexes failed to activate unprimed
        neutrophils but generated a rapid and extensive secretion of reactive oxygen
        metabolites when the cells were primed with granulocyte-macrophage colony
        stimulating factor (GM-CSF). This activity required both Fc\u03b3RII and Fc\u03b3RIIIb
        function. Insoluble immune complexes activated the release of granule enzymes
        from primed or unprimed neutrophils, but the kinetics of release did not parallel
        those of secretion of reactive oxygen metabolites. Only primed neutrophils
        released enzymes in response to soluble complexes. Conclusions: Soluble and
        insoluble immune complexes activate neutrophils by separate receptor signalling
        pathways. Profound changes in neutrophil responsiveness to these complexes
        occur after cytokine priming.", "venue": "Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases",

        can be modulated by a wide varietyof agents including GM-CSF, LPS and TNF-K,

        execution of neutrophilapoptosis. Cell surface receptors and protein kinases,

        are polymorphonuclear leukocytes that are es-sential components of the natural
        immune system. They formthe \u00a2rst line of defence against bacterial and
        fungal infections.Neutrophils are terminally diierentiated cells and are pro-duced
        in the bone marrow from myeloid stem cells by theprocess called \u2018phagocytopoiesis\u2019.
        Whilst they have a veryshort half life in the circulation (8^20 h), this can
        increaseseveral fold once they enter infected or in\u00a3amed tissues [1].Aged
        neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptosis (pro-grammed cell death) in the
        absence of cytokines or otherproin\u00a3ammatory agents prior to their removal
        by macro-phages [2]. This phagocytic removal of intact, apoptotic neu-trophils
        prevents them from releasing their cytotoxic contentinto the extracellular
        milieu that would occur if the cells diedby necrosis. In acute in\u00a3ammation,
        neutrophil numbers withintissues can be extremely high because of targeted
        in\u00a3ux fromthe circulation and because their constitutive apoptotic path-way
        is delayed by the action of local in\u00a3ammatory mediators[3]. Thus, the
        potential for in\u00a3ammatory neutrophils to causetissue damage via the release
        of toxic reactive oxygen speciesand granule enzymes such as proteases is very
        high. Death byapoptosis and safe removal by phagocytic cells thus helps tolimit
        tissue damage during the resolution of in\u00a3ammation.Understanding the
        processes that regulate constitutive neutro-phil apoptosis and cytokine-mediated
        delay of cell death willlead to a better understanding of the molecular pathology
        ofin\u00a3ammatory diseases in which neutrophil apoptosis may beperturbed
        and could also identify new therapeutic targets.2. Molecular changes in neutrophils
        during apoptosisNeutrophils lose their functional properties during apopto-sis
        and they display morphological and biochemical character-istics of an apoptotic
        cell, including cell shrinkage, compac-tion of chromatin and loss of the multilobed
        shape of thenucleus [4^6]. They also show molecular alterations on theircell
        surface that result from either decreased expression ofcertain receptors or
        else the appearance of new surface mole-cules. Neutrophil apoptosis is accompanied
        by the down-reg-ulation of the immunoglobulin superfamily members (e.g.CD31,
        CD50, CD66acde, CD66b, CD63 and CD87) andcell surface receptors (e.g. CD15,
        CD16, CD32, CD35,CD88, CD120b [8,9]). Phosphatidylserine, a molecular markerof
        apoptotic cells, also appears on the surface of apoptoticneutrophils as the
        symmetry of their plasma membrane phos-pholipids is altered [9,10]. The externalisation
        of this moleculefacilitates the recognition of apoptotic neutrophils by macro-phages
        and it is also a convenient indicator of apoptotic neu-trophils as phosphatidylserine
        can bind \u00a3uorescently labelledannexin V [11].Apoptotic neutrophils are
        non-functional and lose the abil-ity to move by chemotaxis, generate a respiratory
        burst ordegranulate. This loss of functional capacity results from thedisablement
        of their activation pathways, and the decreasedexpression of surface receptors
        aids in this shutdown in activ-ity by preventing them e\u2044ciently binding
        extracellular ligands.These inactive neutrophils, with altered surface epitopes,
        arethen phagocytosed [4,5]. Fibroblasts ingesting apoptotic neu-trophils employ

        and accelerated apoptosis", "abstract": "The human neutrophil spontaneously
        undergoes apoptosis, but this type of cell death can be delayed or accelerated
        by a wide variety of agents. There are wide discrepancies in the literature
        regarding the expression of the Bcl\u20102 family of proteins in human neutrophils.
        Here, we show that A1, Mcl\u20101, Bcl\u2010XL, and Bad are major transcripts
        in human neutrophils and that levels of these transcripts are cytokine regulated.
        However, no Bcl\u2010XL protein was detected in Western blots. Protein levels
        for the proapoptotic proteins Bad, Bax, Bak, and Bik remained constant during
        culture, despite changes in the levels of mRNA for these gene products. These
        proapoptotic proteins were extremely stable, having very long half\u2010lives.
        In contrast, A1 and Mcl\u20101 transcripts were extremely unstable (with \u223c3\u2010h
        half\u2010lives), and Mcl\u20101 protein was also subject to rapid turnover.
        These results indicate that neutrophil survival is regulated by the inducible
        expression of the short\u2010lived Mcl\u20101 and possibly the A1 gene products.
        In the absence of their continued expression, these prosurvival gene products
        are rapidly turned over, and then the activity of the stable death proteins

        protein family, which has been shown to delay apoptosis in transfection and/or
        overexpression experiments. As yet no gene knockout mice have been engineered,
        and so there is little evidence to show that loss of Mcl-1 expression is sufficient
        to trigger apoptosis. U937 cells constitutively express the antiapoptotic
        protein Bcl-2; but during differentiation, in response to the phorbol ester
        PMA (phorbol 12 beta-myristate 13 alpha-acetate), Mcl-1 is transiently induced.
        The purpose of this investigation was to determine the functional role played
        by Mcl-1 in this differentiation program. Mcl-1 expression was specifically
        disrupted by chimeric methylphosphonate/phosphodiester antisense oligodeoxynucleotides
        to just 5% of control levels. The depletion of Mcl-1 messenger RNA (mRNA)
        and protein was both rapid and specific, as indicated by the use of control
        oligodeoxynucleotides and analysis of the expression of other BCL2 family
        members and PMA-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Specific
        depletion of Mcl-1 mRNA and protein, in the absence of changes in cellular
        levels of Bcl-2, results in a rapid entry into apoptosis. Levels of the proapoptotic
        protein Bax remained unchanged during differentiation, while Bak expression
        doubled within 24 hours. Apoptosis was detected within 4 hours of Mcl-1 antisense
        treatment by a variety of parameters including a novel live cell imaging technique
        allowing correlation of antisense treatment and apoptosis in individual cells.
        The induction of Mcl-1 is required to prevent apoptosis during differentiation
        of U937 cells, and the constitutive expression of Bcl-2 is unable to compensate
        for the loss of Mcl-1. (Blood. 2000;96:1756-1763)", "venue": "Blood", "year":

        "title": "Regulation of neutrophil Fc\u03b3RIIIb (CD16) surface expression
        following delayed apoptosis in response to GM\u2010CSF and sodium butyrate",
        "abstract": "When neutrophils undergo apoptosis, they lose expression of the
        surface receptor CD16 (Fc\u03b3RIIIb). Thus levels of surface CD16 are good
        indicators of apoptotic or non\u2010apoptotic neutrophils. Shedding of CD16
        occurs via the activity of a metalloproteinase that cleaves the receptor from
        the plasma membrane. Granulocyte\u2010macrophage colony\u2010stimulating factor
        (GM\u2010CSF) and sodium butyrate both stimulate neutrophil gene expression,
        protect these cells from apoptosis, and maintain expression of surface CD16.
        In this report we have investigated whether these agents maintain surface
        expression of CD16 via (1) decreased shedding (2) increased mobilization of
        the internal pool of pre\u2010formed CD16, or (3) via de novo biosynthesis
        of new receptor molecules. Although GM\u2010CSF and sodium butyrate both preserved
        surface expression of CD16, GM\u2010CSF actually accelerated the rate of shedding
        of this receptor. Maintenance of surface levels was achieved by substantial
        mobilization of the internal pool of CD16. Sodium butyrate, on the other hand,
        maintained surface expression without extensive store depletion via a mechanism
        that appeared to involve a decreased rate of shedding. In these experiments
        we could find no evidence for de novo biosynthesis of CD16 stimulated by either
        GM\u2010CSF or sodium butyrate. These experiments indicate that multiple mechanisms
        exist for the maintenance of surface CD16 during rescue of neutrophils from
        apoptosis by different agents. J. Leukoc. Biol. 65: 875\u2013882; 1999.",

        and Apoptosis", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Staphylococcal enterotoxins have marked
        effects on the properties of T cells and monocytes and have recently been
        reported to affect neutrophil function. In this study, we investigated the
        abilities of staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B and toxic shock syndrome
        toxin 1 to affect respiratory burst activity and to delay apoptosis in human
        neutrophils. When cultures containing approximately 97% neutrophils were tested,
        the toxins all delayed neutrophil apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner and
        induced the expression of Fc\u03b3RI on the neutrophil cell surface. These
        effects on apoptosis and expression of Fc\u03b3RI were largely abrogated by
        the addition of a neutralizing anti-gamma interferon antibody. Similarly,
        the effects of these toxins on phorbol ester-induced chemiluminescence were
        decreased after neutralization of gamma interferon. These effects on neutrophil
        function were mimicked by the addition of conditioned medium from peripheral
        blood mononuclear cells incubated with the toxins, and again, neutralizing
        anti-gamma interferon antibodies largely negated the effects. However, when
        highly purified neutrophils prepared by immunodepletion of T cells and major
        histocompatibility complex class II-expressing cells were analyzed, the toxins
        were without effect on apoptosis and Fc\u03b3RI expression, but granulocyte-macrophage
        colony-stimulating factor and gamma interferon could still delay apoptosis.
        These data indicate that these toxins have no direct effect on neutrophil
        apoptosis but can act indirectly via the production of T-cell-derived and
        monocyte-derived cytokines. It is noteworthy that such effects are detected
        in neutrophil suspensions containing only 3% contamination with T cells and
        other mononuclear cells.", "venue": "Infection and Immunity", "year": 1999,

        very short half-life because they constitutively undergo apoptosis. Cytokines,
        such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and other
        agents can rescue neutrophils from apoptosis but the molecular mechanisms
        involved in this rescue are undefined. Here, we show by Western blotting that
        human neutrophils do not express Bcl-2 or Bcl-X but constitutively express
        Bax. However, cellular levels of these proteins are unaffected by agents which
        either accelerate or delay neutrophil apoptosis. In contrast, neutrophils
        express the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 and levels of this protein correlate
        with neutrophil survival. Thus, cellular levels of Mcl-1 decline as neutrophils
        undergo apoptosis and are enhanced by agents (eg, GM-CSF, interleukin-1beta,
        sodium butyrate, and lipopolysaccharide) that promote neutrophil survival.
        Neutrophils only possess few, small mitochondria, and much of the Mcl-1 protein
        seems to be located in nuclear fractions. These observations provide the first

        "abstract": "GM-CSF can play a crucial role in regulating the neutrophil-mediated
        inflammatory response. This growth factor is a proliferative stimulus for
        bone marrow neutrophil stem cell precursors and has at least 3 important roles
        in regulating neutrophil-mediated immunity: a) a direct effect on the proliferation
        and development of neutrophil progenitors; b) synergistic activity with other
        haemopoietic growth factors; c) stimulation of the functional activity of
        mature neutrophils. The production of GM-CSF may be triggered directly by
        exogenous factors such as antigens and endotoxins, or indirectly through the
        release of cytokines by a variety of cells including lymphocytes, activated
        macrophages and endothelial cells exposed to products of mononuclear phagocytes.
        Such production of GM-CSF may serve to quickly release mature neutrophils
        from the bone marrow in response to infections. Moreover, enhancement of the
        function of mature neutrophils may also augment their ability to migrate to
        infective sites and then phagocytose and kill pathogens. Increased expression
        of CD11b/CD18 may play a fundamental part in this mechanism because this receptor
        is essential for the adhesion of neutrophils to the endothelium. Both phagocytosis
        and oxidative burst activity increase as a result of the action of GM-CSF
        and the increased expression of complement- and Fc-receptors can augment opsono-phagocytosis.
        A further level of neutrophil up-regulation occurs by increasing the functional
        life span of neutrophils by GM-CSF. Thus, by delaying neutrophil apoptosis,
        GM-CSF greatly extends the time over which neutrophils may function at inflammatory
        sites. GM-CSF can thus exert a variety of important regulatory controls of
        neutrophil function during bacterial infections. Both the number and the functional
        status of neutrophils is highly regulated by GM-CSF. It is also possible that
        GM-CSF produced within localised sites of acute inflammation or infection
        may attract, trap and then activate neutrophils within this site.", "venue":

        neutrophils and generate intracellular Ca2+transients but fail to activate
        the NADPH oxidase. Following priming of the neutrophils with either tumor
        necrosis factor \u03b1 or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor,
        stimulation of the cells with the soluble immune complexes leads to an enhanced
        Ca2+ signal and significant secretion of reactive oxidants. The enhanced Ca2+
        signal observed in primed neutrophils results from the influx of Ca2+ from
        the external environment and is partly sensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
        This is in contrast to the Ca2+ signal observed in unprimed neutrophils, which
        arises from the mobilization of intracellular stores. When the surface expression
        of Fc\u03b3RIIIb on primed neutrophils was decreased either through incubation
        with Pronase or phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, the extra enhanced
        Ca2+ mobilization seen in primed cells was significantly lowered, while the
        initial rise in intracellular Ca2+ was unaffected. Depletion of Fc\u03b3RIIIb
        had no significant effect on the Ca2+ transients in unprimed neutrophils.
        Cross-linking Fc\u03b3RII, but not Fc\u03b3RIIIb, induced increases in intracellular
        Ca2+ in unprimed neutrophils, while cross-linking either of these receptors

        Ca2+ rise in primed cells was unaffected by incubation in Ca2+-free medium,
        whereas the Fc\u03b3RIIIb-dependent transient was significantly decreased

        Cross-linking either Fc\u03b3RII or Fc\u03b3RIIIb in primed or unprimed cells
        failed to stimulate substantial levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production.
        These results indicate that following stimulation of primed neutrophils with
        soluble immune complexes the enhanced Ca2+ mobilization observed is the result
        of a functional activation of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked Fc\u03b3RIIIb.",

        "abstract": "Neutrophils isolated from the synovial fluid of 16/24 patients
        with rheumatoid arthritis expressed Fc\u03b3RI (CD64), the high\u2010affinity
        receptor for monomeric immunoglobulin G (IgG), on their cell surface. Receptor
        expression ranged from 17% to 168% of the level of expression obtained after
        incubation of control blood neutrophils with 100 U/ml interferon\u2010\u03b3
        (IFN\u2010\u03b3) for 24\u2003hr in vitro. Similarly, mRNA for Fc\u03b3RI
        was detected in synovial fluid neutrophils from 12/15 patients and transcript
        levels ranged from 5% to 200% of the values obtained after treatment of blood
        neutrophils with IFN\u2010\u03b3 for 4\u2003hr in vitro. No surface expression
        nor mRNA were detected in freshly isolated blood neutrophils from either patients
        or from healthy controls. Addition of cell\u2010free synovial fluid to control
        blood neutrophils induced both mRNA and surface expression of Fc\u03b3RI to
        levels that were comparable to those achieved after addition of IFN\u2010\u03b3.
        Neither soluble nor insoluble immune complexes appeared to be involved in
        induction of Fc\u03b3RI expression in spite of the ability of these complexes
        to induce protein biosynthesis. Synovial fluid\u2010induced expression of
        Fc\u03b3RI was partially blocked by incubation with neutralizing IFN\u2010\u03b3
        antibodies, whilst neutralizing interleukin (IL)\u20106 antibodies had little
        effect. Levels of IFN\u2010\u03b3 measured within these synovial fluids ranged
        from 0 to 2\u00b77\u2003U/ml, well within the range known to induce neutrophil
        Fc\u03b3RI expression. These data thus indicate that gene expression in synovial
        fluid neutrophils is selectively activated as the cells enter the diseased
        joint. Furthermore, these data indicate that induced expression of Fc\u03b3RI
        may alter the ability of infiltrating neutrophils to respond to IgG\u2010containing
        immune complexes present in these joints.", "venue": "Immunology", "year":

        was enhanced by 1 mM ATP, but this ATP-enhanced activity was blocked by inhibitors

        on tyrosine residues, but higher levels of phosphorylation on serine/threonine
        residues. Addition of pervanadate hydroperoxides stimulated phosphorylation
        on tyrosine residues and activated PLD which was blocked by addition of inhibitors

        has been thought of as a terminally differentiated cell with little or no
        capacity or requirement for de novo protein synthesis. It has recently been
        demonstrated that neutrophils are biosynthetically active and that the biosynthesis
        of some cellular components is essential to maintain the neutrophil in an
        active state [I]. It has also been shown that neutrophls can synthesise and
        secrete a range of cytokines in v i m including Interleukin (1L)-I p, IL-6,
        IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor-a (TNFa), all of which are present in the
        synovial fluid of rheumatoid joints [2,3]. L I P has been implicated as a
        mediator of tissueand bone-damage in rheumatoid arthritis and among its many
        effects it has been shown to stimulate osteoclasts and chondrocytes to resorb
        bone 131. As neutrophils can comprise 80% of the cell population in a rheumatoid
        joint, their production of IL-IP in the joint could be an important contributing
        factor in the perpetuation of the disease. This production in the joint could
        have many effects including the stimulation of production of further IL1 P
        by forming a positive feedback loop. IL-1p has also been shown to enhance
        adhesion molecule expression on vascular endothelium thereby promoting the
        accumulation of further neutrophils and other leukocytes [4]. Here we show
        the synthesis of IL-lp by neutrophils in response to rheumatoid synovial fluid.
        Neutrophils were isolated from fresh buffy coats as described previously [5]
        and suspended in RPMI 1640 medium. Suspensions (2x10\u2019 celldml) were re-incubated

        synthetic soluble or insoluble immune complexes (10 %, v/v) or cell free synovial
        fluid (5 %, v/v) were added. Incubation was continued at 37\u00b0C with gentle
        agitation for time periods of up to 24 h. After incubation, cells were pelleted
        and any IL-Ip present in the cells or culture medium was immunoprecipitated
        as described previously [6]. The immuno-precipitated samples were then analysed
        by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. P", "venue": "Biochemical Society Transactions",

        "title": "Modulation of neutrophil apoptosis by pharmacological agents.",
        "abstract": "The human neutrophil is known to have a short half-life in circulation,
        estimated to be between 8 and 16 h. This lifespan is so short because circulating
        neutrophils constituitively undergo apoptosis. As neutrophils become apoptotic
        the chromatin becomes condensed and fragmented, expression of the low affinity
        receptor for IgG (CD16) on the cell surface falls and functional activities
        such as the ability to produce superoxide are diminished [ 11. Apoptotic circulating
        neutrophils are quickly cleared from the circulation by phagwytic cells, which
        recognise markers of apoptosis on the cell surface [2]. As the mature neutrophil
        has such a short lifespan, the production of neutrophils from the bone marrow
        must be maintained at -5 x 10\" every day to keep numbers of circulating neutrophils
        at levels that are able to protect against infections. If this production
        of neutrophils is disrupted, neutropaenia quickly develops, resulting in a
        decreased ability to fight off bacterial or fungal infections. Patients undergoing
        chemoor radio-therapy for the treatment of certain leukaemia''s and solid
        tumours are known to suffer from neutropaenia during the periods of treatment
        due to damage to the bone marrow. The period and severity of the neutropeania
        vary greatly, but in all cases there is an increased risk of infection in
        these patients. This often results in a suspension of therapy and increased
        hospitalisation times. This therapyinduced neutropaenia may be managed by
        the use of colony stimulating factors such as Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating
        Factor (GM-CSF) to increase the production of neutrophils from the bone marrow.
        These treatments show a reduction in the period and severity of the neutropeania
        but side-effects such as increased adhesion of neutrophils to capillary walls
        and pulmonary accumulation, due to up-regulation of certain surface proteins,
        may be seen. These side-effects are a consequence of neutrophil priming. As
        an alternative to the use of colony stimulating factors to increase neutrophil
        production we have been studying the effects of three pharmacological agents
        (5azacytidine, hexarnethylene-bis-acetamide [HMBA] and sodium butyrate) on
        neutrophil apoptosis, with the aim of increasing the functional lifespan of
        the circulating neutrophil. Each of these drugs have previously been shown
        not to prime neutrophils [3] and so should not elicit the side effects that
        result from CSFinduced increases in adhesion. Neutrophils were isolated from
        venous blood of healthy volunteers to >98% purity, and suspended in RPMI 1640
        medium supplemented with 0.25% (v/v) foetal calf serum and 2 mM L-glutamine
        as in [4]. Suspensions of 5 x lo6 celldml were incubated with no additions
        (controls), or were supplemented with 50 U/ml GM-CSF, 50 ph4 5-azacytidine,
        1 mM hexamethylene-bis-acetamide, 0.4 mM sodium butyrate or a combination
        of GM-CSF with each of the other drugs. After incubation at 37 \"C for 22
        h neutrophil aliquots were used for morphological assessment of apoptosis,
        ability to produce superoxide, and measurement of DNA fragmentation. Cytospins
        were prepared from 10'' cells and stained with May-Griinwald solution; at
        least 500 cells were assessed per slide [4]. Superoxide production was measured
        from 5 x Id cells with 10 @I luminol using either 1 @I f-Met-Leu-Phe or 100
        ng/d PMA [5]. DNA fragmentation was measured by separating fragmented and
        non-fragmented DNA by cenbifugation and determining DNA content colorimetrically
        using diphenylamine reagent [4]. Table 1. shows that sodium butyrate protects
        neutrophils from apoptosis more effectively than GM-CSF, confirming our previous
        results, and that this effect is enhanced when these two agents are used together.
        Sodium butyrate [6], 5-azacyt1dine [7] and HMBA [8] have all been shown to
        increase gene transcription in other cell types, and to stimulate protein
        biosynthesis in human neutrophils [3]. However neither HMBA or 5-azacyt1dine

        "abstract": "TOBS 20 - SEPTEMBER 1995 THE MAIN FUNCTION of neutrophils is
        to seek out and destroy invading mb crobial pathogens in order to protect
        the host from infections. During phagocy- tosis, many antimicrobial enzyme
        sys- tems are activated and delivered at high concentrations into phagocytic
        yes- ides, where they first kill, then digest, the pathogens (Fig. la). These
        antimi- crobial systems include an 02-/H~O~- generating NADPH oxidase, myelo-
        peroxidase, a ~-ariety of proteases, hydrolases and proteins that affect the
        permeability of the microbial plasma membraneL The components of the NADPH
        oxidase 2, as well as many of the other ant[microbial proteins, have now been
        identified and characterized at the molecular level, but the mechanisms by
        which they become activated have not been fully defined. Indeed, the signal
        transduction systems that regulate ac- tivation of the NADPH oxidase and phagocytosis
        are extraordinarily com- plex, which probably reflects the need for tight
        control of neutrophil function, since if the products of the NADPH oxi- dase
        or the degradative enzymes were released from neutrophils in high concentrations
        (Fig. lb) they could inflict considerable damage to the host tissues. Activation
        and priming In order to mount an effective anti- microbial challenge, circulating
        neutro- phUs must respond appropriately to a range of pro-inflammatory signals.
        After leaving the circulation and migrating by chemotaxis to the site of infection,
        they must recognize, bind and engulf the pathogens into phagocytic vesicles.
        The NADPH oxidase is then activated (the respiratory burst) and the anti-
        microbial enzymes (normally located within subcellular granules) are dis-
        charged into the pathogen-containing vesicles. The major neutrophil chemoattractants
        [formyl-Met.Leu.Phe ([bliP), complement component C5a, platelet-activating
        [actor, Leukotrie~le B 4 (LTB4) and interleukin-8] are recognized by receptors
        that possess a common structure with seven transmembrane helices, originally
        identified in the rhodopsin-llke, G-protein-coupled recep- tors. Much is known
        of the mechanisms by which these chemoattractants activate neutrophlls, and
        many of the signalling systems that are involved $. W, F.ch~NIs is at the

        work has shown that Fc gamma RIII expression in isolated neonate neutrophils
        is defective. We have re-examined this phenomenon in view of the facts that
        (1) the receptor is present on mobilisable subcellular stores and (2) commonly
        used isolation procedures can affect receptor expression in suspensions of
        isolated neutrophils. Receptor expression was measured by fluorescence-activated
        cell sorter analysis of neutrophils in unfractionated whole blood. Examination
        of receptor expression in preterm, term and adult neutrophils indicated small
        but significantly decreased expression of CR1 and CR3 in preterm neutrophils
        compared with term neutrophils (p < 0.01). A small decrease in expression
        was found for Fc gamma RI and Fc gamma RIII (p < 0.05). No significant difference
        in expression of Fc gamma RII was observed in all groups analysed. These data
        suggest that isolated preterm neonate neutrophils have greatly decreased expression
        of Fc gamma RIII because of impaired composition or mobilisation of the subcellular

        from control blood neutrophils after incubation in vitro with granulocyte

        and insoluble immunoglobulin aggregates isolated from the synovial fluid of
        patients with rheumatoid arthritis.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES--Synovial fluid
        from patients with rheumatoid arthritis contains both soluble and insoluble
        immunoglobulin aggregates which activate reactive oxidant production in human
        neutrophils. The objectives were to determine the roles played by Fc gamma
        receptors in activation of neutrophils by these complexes. METHODS--Pronase
        treatment was used to remove Fc gamma RIII from the neutrophil surface and
        blocking monoclonal antibodies were used to prevent the binding of complexes
        to Fc gamma RII and Fc gamma RIII. RESULTS--When Fc gamma RIII was removed
        from the cell surface by pronase treatment, activation by the soluble aggregates
        did not occur [mean (SD) inhibition 89 (16)%, n = 6] whereas activation via
        the insoluble aggregates was less affected [34 (16)%, n = 6]. Blocking the
        binding to Fc gamma RIII with antibodies decreased activation in response
        to the soluble aggregates [mean (SD) inhibition 71 (22)%, n = 8] but again
        had a lower effect on activation by the insoluble aggregates [40 (17)%, n
        = 9]. When binding to Fc gamma RII was blocked, activation via the soluble
        aggregates was substantially inhibited [mean (SD) 93 (13)%, n = 8] whereas
        that via the insoluble aggregates was inhibited to a much lesser extent [28
        (38)%, n = 9]. When Fc gamma RII and III were simultaneously blocked, activation
        by the insoluble aggregates was only inhibited by 45% [(19), n = 5]. CONCLUSION--These
        data thus indicate that activation of human neutrophils by soluble immunoglobulin
        aggregates from rheumatoid synovial fluid occurs via cooperative occupancy
        of both Fc gamma RII and III: perturbation of binding to either of these receptor
        classes will abrogate activation.", "venue": "Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases",

        "The diadenosine polyphosphates, Ap3A and Ap4A, prime the respiratory burst
        of human neutrophils after stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe. Maximal priming
        of oxidase activity occurred at 600-800 microM Ap3A and Ap4A, compared with
        maximal priming observed at 200 microM ATP. The time course of priming of
        the oxidase by all 3 nucleotides was very rapid, being detectable if added
        within 10 s of fMet-Leu-Phe. All 3 nucleotides also elicited increases in
        intracellular Ca2+ levels and there was a close concentration-dependency between
        the extent of priming and the increase in intracellular Ca2+. However, at
        low concentrations of nucleotides (< 50 microM Ap3A and Ap4A and < 0.1 microM
        ATP) priming of the oxidase was observed without detectable increases in intracellular
        Ca2+. These observations indicate that diadenosine polyphosphates may be novel
        regulators of neutrophil function and that priming of oxidase activity may
        occur via mechanisms that are either dependent or independent of increases
        in intracellular Ca2+.", "venue": "Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications

        (100 U/ml) caused a significant increase (P < 0.001) in lucigenin-dependent

        systems.", "abstract": "Cell-free synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid
        arthritis contains soluble and insoluble IgG-containing immune complexes which
        activate reactive oxidant production in human neutrophils. In this report
        we have measured the effects of inhibitors of signal transduction pathways
        on neutrophil activation by these complexes and also following activation
        by synthetic soluble and insoluble immune complexes made from human serum
        albumin (HSA) and anti-(HSA) antibodies. In all aspects studied, the soluble
        rheumatoid complexes and the soluble synthetic complexes were indistinguishable
        in the ways in which they activated neutrophils. Activation of reactive oxidant
        production in response to these soluble complexes was completely inhibited
        by pertussis toxin (indicating G-protein coupling of receptor occupancy),
        completely insensitive to staurosporine (indicating that oxidant production
        did not require protein kinase C activity), only marginally (< 30%) inhibited
        by butanol (indicating that dependence upon activity of phospholipase D was
        minimal), and completely inhibited by chloracysine, an inhibitor of phospholipase
        A2. In contrast, activation of reactive oxidant production in response to
        the insoluble rheumatoid or insoluble synthetic immune complexes was largely
        pertussis toxin insensitive, inhibited by > 50% by staurosporine, inhibited
        by > 50% by butanol, and completely inhibited by chloracysine. These results
        show that the receptor-mediated signal transduction systems activated by the
        soluble and insoluble immune complexes are different. Because the soluble
        complexes activate a transient burst of reactive oxidant secretion from primed
        neutrophils, the mechanisms regulating either the release or the intracellular
        production of oxidants within rheumatoid joints are distinct and hence may
        be pharmacologically modified independently of each other.", "venue": "FEMS

        neutrophils do not express mRNA for interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), but transcripts
        for this cytokine are rapidly induced following exposure to recombinant granulocyte-macrophage
        colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) in vitro. Levels of IL-1 beta mRNA reach
        maximal values 1 h after exposure to rGM-CSF and then decline to near basal
        levels by 4 h. Similarly, rGM-CSF treatment of blood neutrophils in vitro
        induced increases in levels of mRNA for IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha
        (TNF-alpha). RNA extracted from neutrophils isolated from the synovial fluid
        of patients with rheumatoid arthritis expressed low, but significant levels
        of IL-1 beta mRNA that were between 0.5 and 3% of the levels that could be
        maximally induced by rGM-CSF treatment of blood neutrophils. However, transcripts
        for TNF-alpha and IL-6 were not detected in these synovial fluid neutrophils.
        mRNA for transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) was constitutively expressed
        in blood and synovial fluid neutrophils and transcripts for this cytokine
        were not altered by rGM-CSF exposure. Because of the transient nature of IL-1
        beta expression by activated neutrophils, we propose that the low levels of
        expression of mRNA for this cytokine in the synovial fluid neutrophils represents
        expression by a small, perhaps newly-recruited and activated, sub-population
        of cells. IL-1 beta expression by this sub-population may thus contribute
        to the pathogenesis of rheumatoid disease.", "venue": "FEMS Immunology & Medical

        "title": "Activation of neutrophils by soluble and insoluble immunoglobulin
        aggregates from synovial fluid of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.", "abstract":
        "OBJECTIVES--Previous work has shown that synovial fluid isolated from patients
        with active rheumatoid arthritis contains soluble (not sedimented by centrifugation
        at 11,600 g for two minutes) and insoluble (sedimented by centrifugation at
        11,600 g for two minutes) immunoglobulin aggregates that are capable of activating
        reactive oxidant production by bloodstream neutrophils. The purpose of this
        study was to determine which of these types of immunoglobulin aggregates activated
        the secretion of reactive oxygen metabolites and granule enzymes from neutrophils.
        METHODS--Cell free synovial fluid (from patients with rheumatoid arthritis)
        was added to neutrophils isolated from blood of healthy controls that had
        been incubated in the presence and absence of granulocyte-macrophage colony
        stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Reactive oxidant production was measured by luminol
        chemiluminescence (which detects both intracellular and extracellular oxidant
        production) and by cytochrome c reduction (which measures superoxide secretion).
        RESULTS--The soluble aggregates only activated neutrophils that were previously
        primed, and activated a rapid and transient burst of reactive oxidant secretion.
        On the other hand, the insoluble aggregates activated primed and unprimed
        neutrophils with similar efficacy and most of the oxidants generated (especially
        in unprimed cells) were intracellular. The soluble aggregates, but not the
        insoluble aggregates, also activated the secretion of myeloperoxidase from
        neutrophils that had either been pretreated with cytochalasin B or primed
        with GM-CSF. CONCLUSION--It is thus proposed that these soluble immunoglobulin
        aggregates are responsible for activation of the release of tissue damaging
        granule enzymes and reactive oxidants from primed neutrophils within the rheumatoid
        joint.", "venue": "Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases", "year": 1993, "referenceCount":

        Insoluble immunoglobulin aggregates present in the synovial fluid of patients

        reactive oxidant and granule enzyme secretion from bloodstream neutrophils.
        These insoluble complexes activated luminol chemiluminescence, but did not
        activate O2\u2010, H2O2 or granule enzyme secretion and did not activate lucigenin
        chemiluminescence, which also measures reactive oxidant secretion. Hence,
        the luminol chemiluminescence detected after activation by insoluble immunoglobulin
        aggregates must be due to intracellularly generated reactive oxidants, i.e.
        produced within phagolysosomes. Because reactive oxidant and granule enzyme
        secretion has occurred within rheumatoid joints, other mechanisms of neutro\u2010phil

        Acanthamoeba castellanii generated both luminol- and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence
        upon addition of the respiratory inhibitor sodium cyanide, but not upon the
        addition of sodium azide. Photon emission in the presence of lucigenin was
        three- to fourfold greater than that measured in the presence of luminol,
        but both forms of chemiluminescence were strictly dependent upon the presence
        of O2, indicating the requirement for oxidative reactions in these processes.
        Lucigenin-chemilununescence measured during the phagocytosis of latex beads
        under identical conditions was, however, barely detectable above background
        levels. Cyanide similarly induced the formation of O-2, as indicated by the
        stimulation of superoxide-dismutase-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction, and
        the rate of production was similar to that previously observed during phagocytosis
        of latex particles or yeasts by these cells. Thus, in view of the similar
        rates of O-2 production during cyanide exposure or phagocytosis, but disparate
        rates of lucigenin-chemiluminescence, these two treatments must activate different
        molecular processes leading to reactive oxidant production. The rates of cyanide-stimulated
        lucigenin-chemiluminescence were directly proportional to the O2 tensions
        in the medium from 0 to 300 \u03bcM, indicating that the rates of free-radical-generating
        reactions were directly related to the oxygen tensions in the environment.

        cultures of the soil amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii suspended in phosphate-buffered
        saline exhibit stimulated O2 uptake in response to phagocytosis of either

        or -inhibited cultures, and was therefore independent of the relative activities
        of the alternative mitochondrial oxidases known to exist in this organism.
        The extra O2 consumed during phagocytosis was stoichiometrically converted

        This compound had no inhibitory effect on the kinetics of O2.- generation
        or O2 uptake during the respiratory burst, but inhibited both the peroxidative
        activity of purified myeloperoxidase and the chemiluminescence generated by
        a cell-free myeloperoxidase/H2O2 system. The concentration of salicylhydroxamic
        acid necessary for complete inhibition of myeloperoxidase activity was 30-50
        microM (I50 values of 3-5 microM) compared with the non-specific inhibitor
        NaN3, which exhibited maximal inhibition at 100-200 microM (I50 values of
        30-50 microM). Whereas taurine inhibited the luminol chemiluminescence of
        an H2O2/HOC1 system by HOC1 scavenging, this compound had little effect on
        myeloperoxidase/H2O2-dependent luminol chemiluminescence; in contrast, 10
        microM-salicylhydroxamic acid did not quench HOC1 significantly but greatly

        peroxidase inhibition rather than non-specific HOC1 scavenging. Salicylhydroxamic
        acid prevented the formation of myeloperoxidase Compound II, but only at low

        both \"primed\" their ability to generate reactive oxidants and increased
        their rate of protein synthesis. This increased rate of protein synthesis
        was greatest 60 min after the addition of 100 U/ml gamma-interferon and was
        not due to an increased intracellular pool of radiolabelled amino acid. Analysis
        of the newly-synthesized polypeptides by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel
        electrophoresis (PAGE) revealed two classes of proteins which were regulated
        by this agent. The first of these represented proteins whose rate of labelling
        increased very little (1-2-fold) whereas the rate of biosynthesis of a second
        group of proteins increased more markedly (10-20-fold). We propose that these
        newly-synthesized, gamma-interferon regulated proteins play an important role
        in the function of these cells during an acute inflammatory response.", "venue":

        intraphagosomal myeloperoxidase activity in order to evaluate the role of
        this enzyme in the killing of Staphylococcus aureus by human neutrophils.
        50 microM-SHAM reduced the luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response stimulated
        during phagocytosis of unopsonized latex beads and opsonized S. aureus by
        over 80% and 60%, respectively. When opsonized S. aureus were incubated with
        neutrophils, 45% were killed within 15 min incubation and 60% by 1 h. However,
        in neutrophil suspensions incubated with 50 microM-SHAM, only 13% were killed
        by 15 min whilst 71% still remained viable after 1 h. This inhibitor had no
        effect upon the number of bacteria phagocytosed or upon degranulation. In
        a cell-free system, 2.5 microM-H2O2 alone killed 55% of the bacteria, whereas
        in the presence of myeloperoxidase (i.e. 10 mU myeloperoxidase and 2.5 microM-H2O2)
        virtually all of the bacteria were killed: the addition of 50 microM-SHAM
        abolished this myeloperoxidase-enhanced killing but did not affect the H2O2-dependent
        killing. We therefore conclude that in normal neutrophils whilst H2O2 is required
        for killing of this pathogen, both myeloperoxidase-dependent and -independent

        with impaired bactericidal activity.", "abstract": "We describe a case of
        a 5-year-old male patient with prolonged and extensive osteomyelitis of the
        left femur. Staphylococcus aureus was grown from blood cultures taken upon
        admission and also from pus drained from an incised hip joint. A defect in
        immune function was suspected and neutrophil function was assessed. Chemotaxis
        and phagocytosis were normal, but phagocytosed S. aureus were not killed as
        efficiently as in control neutrophils. No inherent defect in the ability of
        these neutrophils to generate reactive oxidants was observed, but an unusual
        luminol-dependent chemiluminescence response was obtained during phagocytosis
        of latex beads or opsonized S. aureus: This was characterized by an initial
        rapid, but transient increase occurring within 1 min of addition of phagocytic
        stimulus. Whereas during phagocytosis of latex beads by control neutrophils
        less than 1% of the total myeloperoxidase activity was detected extracellularly,
        up to 15% was released from the patient''s neutrophils. We propose that release
        of myeloperoxidase from the patient''s neutrophils during phagocytosis reduces
        the intraphagosomal concentration of this enzyme and thus impairs the efficiency
        of intracellular killing of S. aureus.", "venue": "Journal of clinical & laboratory

        pigeon erythrocyte ghosts containing fluorescein was carried out to determine
        whether lysis involved a gradual release of fluorescein or a ''threshold''

        nuclei were identified by fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscopy.
        Fluorescence distributions analysed by flow cytometry indicated that, after
        complement attack, those ghosts remaining intact retained all their fluorescent
        label. A time course of changes in ratios of the three subpopulations indicated
        that once lysis of an individual ghost was initiated, release of label was
        complete within 1 min; no stages of intermediary fluorescence appeared, and
        those ghosts remaining at the end of the experiment retained the same fluorescence
        intensity as control ghosts. The results supported the hypothesis that complement-mediated
        cell lysis is a ''threshold'' phenomenon; a submaximal response by a cell

        experiments with intact cells or mitochondria. 3. The time of exposure to
        CO and the nature of the reductant are both important in identifying all the
        components present, in that the b-type cytochrome is more readily distinguished
        after longer exposure to CO and more of the c-type cytochrome is detectable
        when NADH is the reductant 4. Treatment of mitochondria with ultrasound releases
        two components, identifiable in low-temperature difference spectra as a c-type

        oxidize alpha-oxoglutarate, succinate and NADH with ADP:O ratios of about

        respiration was stimulated up to 50% by 1mm-cyanide (type-A mitochondria)
        and from cyanide-sensitive cultures (type-B mitochondria) had similar respiratory-control
        ratios and ADP:O ratios. 3. State-3 rates of respiration were generally more
        cyanide-sensitive than State-4 rates, and the respiration of type-A mitochondria
        was more cyanide-resistant than that of type-B mitochondria. 4. Salicylhydroxamic
        acid alone had little effect on respiratory activities of either type of mitochondria,
        but when added together with cyanide, irrespective of the order of addition,
        inhibition was almost complete. 5. Oxidation of externally added NADH by type-A
        mitochondria was mainly via an oxidase with a low affinity for oxygen (K(m)[unk]15mum),
        which was largely cyanide-sensitive and partially antimycin A-sensitive; this
        electron-transport pathway was inhibited by ADP. 6. Cyanide-insensitive but
        salicylhydroxamic acid-sensitive respiration was stimulated by AMP and ADP,

        to mitochondria oxidizing alpha-oxoglutarate lowered the ADP:O ratios by about
        one-third and rendered inhibition by cyanide more complete. 8. The results
        suggest that mitochondria of A. castellanii possess branched pathways of electron

        the growth cycle of Acanthamoeba castellanii in a proteose peptone/glucose/yeast
        extract medium. A transition occurred at the mid-exponential phase of growth
        without any change in the growth rate. A second transition corresponded with
        the cessation of growth; the specific activities of cytochrome c oxidase,
        succinate dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase declined during the stationary
        phase of growth whereas the specific activities of catalase and the acid hydrolases
        increased. Glucose was not utilized during the first 30 h of growth and the
        respiration rate was low, AMP levels were high and some AMP appeared extracellularly.
        After 30 h, values for the adenylate charge rose from less than 0.1 to more
        than 0.7, although ATP levels per cell did not vary. When cells were grown
        in conditioned medium (obtained by removing cells from a 48 h culture) the
        characteristics of a normal culture observed before 30 h were lost.", "venue":

        "Respiration of Acanthamoeba castellanii shows varying sensitivity to cyanide
        during exponential growth in a medium containing proteose peptone, glucose
        and yeast extract. After 20 h growth, respiration was stimulated up to 40%
        by 1 mM-cyanide; sensitivity to cyanide then gradually increased until 90%
        inhibition of respiration was attained in late-exponential phase cultures.
        Salicyl hydroxamic acid alone never stimulated or inhibited respiration by
        more than 20% but, when added together with cyanide, inhibition was always
        70 to 100% from 3h onward. Sensitivity to antimycin A was similar, but not
        identical to that shown to cyanide; when antimycin A was added together with
        salicyl hydroxamic acid, the inhibition was greater. Increased sensitivities
        to arsenite and malonate were also observed in late-exponential phase cultures.
        These changes in sensitivities were not associated with alterations in the
        growth medium since similar changes in sensitivity to inhibitors were observed
        during growth in conditioned medium. A rotenone-sensitive site is associated
        with cyanide-stimulated respiration and the results suggest that A. castellanii

        centrifuge rotors (Warmsley & Pasternak, 1970). Both rate-sedimentation and

        However, these methods suffer from a major drawback. Organisms must be harvested
        from their growth media, resuspended, loaded on to the gradient, then separated
        and recovered. Such procedures may take up to I h during which time the organisms
        are exposed to conditions of nutrient and oxygen deprivation, suboptimal growth
        temperatures and, in some cases, unfavourable osmotic environments. Continuous-flow
        cell cycle fractionation in a Sharples Supercentrifuge is completed in less

        is a prevalent health problem. Most causes of syncope are benign and can be
        diagnosed based on history and physical examinations. Nonetheless, overtesting
        for syncope is a major healthcare problem associated with increased costs.
        In this study, we sought to assess the testing trends for the evaluation of
        syncope.\n \n \n Methods:\n We used data from the IBM MarketScan Research
        Database, which captures deidentified, individual-level information in the
        United States from approximately 100 commercial payers and self-insured corporations,
        not including Medicaid claims. We identified patients with the first diagnosis
        of syncope from 2010-2020 using ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Patients were followed
        up for three months to determine the rate of testing for syncope.\n \n \n
        Results:\n We identified 2,500,850 patients (57.9% women) with a mean age
        of 48.5 years. The overall rate of anatomical neurological testing was higher
        than cardiac anatomical testing (43.3% vs. 25.5%, p<0.001). The rate of the
        following tests decreased over time: cardiac stress testing (17.4% to 11.4%,
        p<0.001, figure 1A), carotid ultrasound (13.1% to 7.2%, p<0.001, figure 1C)
        and EEG (7.3% to 5.7%, p<0.001, figure 1C). The rate of CT chest angiography
        increased significantly (3.6% to 6.1%, p<0.001, figure 1B). The rates of long-term
        ECG monitoring, echocardiogram, chest x-ray, and neck and brain imaging remained
        the same (Figures 1A-C).\n \n \n Conclusion:\n Although prior studies demonstrated
        low yield for most cardiac and neurological evaluations for syncope and the
        reduction of testing over time (stress testing, carotid doppler, EEG), high
        rates of testing remained prevalent in syncope patients. Efforts are needed
        to reduce the use of low-yield diagnostic studies in syncope patients.\n \n

        We identified 1,737,382 ED visits from 2010-2020. There was a significant
        reduction in hospital admissions for syncope (11.5% to 1.4%, p<0.001). In
        contrast, observation rates increased (5.4% to 8.5%, p<0.001), figure 1A.
        The rate of discharge home from the ED increased (83.1% to 90.1%, p<0.001).
        The same trends were seen for patients younger or older than 65 years, figures
        1B and 1C, respectively. Nonetheless, the admission or observation rate was
        significantly higher for older patients (15.5% vs. 8.6%, p<0.001).\n \n \n
        Conclusions:\n Hospital admissions for syncope declined over the past decade.
        There is a need to assess if this has affected mortality or recurrent ED visits
        for syncope.\n \n \n \n", "venue": "Circulation", "year": 2022, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Optimal CT perfusion thresholds for core and penumbra in acute posterior
        circulation infarction", "abstract": "Background At least 20% of strokes involve
        the posterior circulation (PC). Compared to the anterior circulation, posterior
        circulation infarction (POCI) are frequently misdiagnosed. CT perfusion (CTP)
        has advanced stroke care by improving diagnostic accuracy and expanding eligibility
        for acute therapies. Clinical decisions are predicated upon precise estimates
        of the ischaemic penumbra and infarct core. Current thresholds for defining
        core and penumbra are based upon studies of anterior circulation stroke. We
        aimed to define the optimal CTP thresholds for core and penumbra in POCI.
        Methods Data were analyzed from 331-patients diagnosed with acute POCI enrolled
        in the International-stroke-perfusion-registry (INSPIRE). Thirty-nine patients
        with baseline multimodal-CT with occlusion of a large PC-artery and follow
        up diffusion weighted MRI at 24\u201348 h were included. Patients were divided
        into two-groups based on artery-recanalization on follow-up imaging. Patients
        with no or complete recanalisation were used for penumbral and infarct-core
        analysis, respectively. A Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was used
        for voxel-based analysis. Optimality was defined as the CTP parameter and
        threshold which maximized the area-under-the-curve. Linear regression was
        used for volume based analysis determining the CTP threshold which resulted
        in the smallest mean volume difference between the acute perfusion lesion
        and follow up MRI. Subanalysis of PC-regions was performed. Results Mean transit
        time (MTT) and delay time (DT) were the best CTP parameters to characterize
        ischaemic penumbra (AUC = 0.73). Optimal thresholds for penumbra were a DT
        >1 s and MTT>145%. Delay time (DT) best estimated the infarct core (AUC =
        0.74). The optimal core threshold was a DT >1.5 s. The voxel-based analyses
        indicated CTP was most accurate in the calcarine (Penumbra-AUC = 0.75, Core-AUC
        = 0.79) and cerebellar regions (Penumbra-AUC = 0.65, Core-AUC = 0.79). For
        the volume-based analyses, MTT >160% demonstrated best correlation and smallest
        mean-volume difference between the penumbral estimate and follow-up MRI (R2
        = 0.71). MTT >170% resulted in the smallest mean-volume difference between
        the core estimate and follow-up MRI, but with poor correlation (R2 = 0.11).
        Conclusion CTP has promising diagnostic utility in POCI. Accuracy of CTP varies
        by brain region. Optimal thresholds to define penumbra were DT >1 s and MTT
        >145%. The optimal threshold for core was a DT >1.5 s. However, CTP core volume
        estimates should be interpreted with caution.", "venue": "Frontiers in Neurology",

        Fibrillation not on therapeutic anticoagulation.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION\nAnticoagulation
        significantly reduces the risk of ischaemic stroke in patients with atrial
        fibrillation (AF). There are a proportion of patients with known AF who remain
        off anticoagulation. This study aims to retrospectively compare the baseline
        characteristics, treatments and functional outcomes between patients with
        ischaemic stroke and known atrial fibrillation based on their anticoagulation
        status.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA single centre, retrospective review of consecutive
        patients with an ischaemic stroke and a known history of AF was conducted
        RESULTS: 204 patients with an ischaemic stroke had documented AF prior to
        the index admission, of which 126 were anticoagulated. Median admission NIHSS
        score was lower for anticoagulated patients, though not statistically significant
        (5.1 vs 7.0 p=\u20090.09). Median baseline mRS did not significantly differ.
        Non-anticoagulated patients were more likely to have large vessel occlusions
        (37.2% vs 23.8%, p=0.04) and more likely to receive intravenous thrombolysis
        (15.4% versus 1.6%, p<0.01). There was no difference in rates of endovascular
        clot retrieval between groups (p>0.05). Unfavourable functional outcome at
        90\u2009days (mRS >=\u20093) did not significantly differ between groups (p=0.51).
        38.5% of non-anticoagulated patients had no documented reason for this. Of
        the patients who survived the index admission 81.5% of patients who were not
        anticoagulated on admission received anticoagulation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBaseline
        anticoagulation was associated with milder stroke severity patients with known
        AF and an ischaemic stroke. There was no significant difference in functional
        outcomes at 90\u2009days between groups. Larger observational studies are
        required to further assess this cohort. This article is protected by copyright.

        Setting", "abstract": "Background: Definitive diagnosis of acute ischemic
        stroke is challenging, particularly in telestroke settings. Although the prognostic
        utility of CT perfusion (CTP) has been questioned, its diagnostic value remains
        under-appreciated, especially in cases without an easily visible intracranial
        occlusion. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of routine CTP in the acute
        telestroke setting. Methods: Acute and follow-up data collected prospectively
        from consecutive suspected patients with stroke assessed by a state-wide telestroke
        service between March 2020 and August 2021 at 12 sites in Australia were analyzed.
        All patients in the final analysis had been assessed with multimodal CT, including
        CTP, which was post-processed with automated volumetric software. Diagnostic
        sensitivity and specificity were calculated for multimodal CT and each individual
        component (noncontrast CT [NCCT], CT angiogram [CTA], and CTP). Final diagnosis
        determined by consensus review of follow-up imaging and clinical data was
        used as the reference standard. Results: During the study period, complete
        multimodal CT examination was obtained in 831 patients, 457 of whom were diagnosed
        with stroke. Diagnostic sensitivity for ischemic stroke increased by 19.5
        percentage points when CTP was included with NCCT and CTA compared with NCCT
        and CTA alone (73.1% positive with NCCT+CTA+CTP [95% CI, 68.8\u201377.1] versus
        53.6% positive with NCCT+CTA alone [95% CI, 48.9\u201358.3], P<0.001). No
        difference was observed between specificities of NCCT+CTA and NCCT+CTA+CTP
        (98.7% [95% CI, 98.5\u2013100] versus 98.7% [95% CI, 96.9\u201399.6], P=0.13).
        Multimodal CT, including CTP, demonstrated the highest negative predictive
        value (75.0% [95% CI, 72.1\u201377.7]). Patients with stroke not evident on
        CTP had small volume infarcts on follow-up (1.2 mL, interquartile range 0.5\u20132.7mL).
        Conclusions: Acquisition of CTP as part of a telestroke imaging protocol permits
        definitive diagnosis of cerebral ischemia in 1 in 5 patients with normal NCCT
        and CTA.", "venue": "Stroke", "year": 2022, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount":

        Diverse Communities in South Western Sydney and New South Wales", "abstract":
        "Introduction: Culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities are
        growing globally. Understanding patterns of cerebrovascular disease in CALD
        communities may improve health outcomes through culturally specific interventions.
        We compared rates of transient ischaemic attack (TIA)/stroke (ischaemic stroke,
        intracerebral haemorrhage) and stroke risk factor prevalence in overseas and
        Australian-born people in South Western Sydney (SWS) and New South Wales (NSW).
        Methods: This was a 10-year retrospective analysis (2011\u20132020) of SWS
        and NSW age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years of TIA/stroke. Data
        were extracted from Health Information Exchange and Secure Analytics for Population
        Health Research and Intelligence systems. Rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes
        mellitus (T2DM), atrial fibrillation (AF), smoking, and obesity were also
        calculated. Results: The SWS and NSW age-standardized rate of TIA/stroke for
        people born in Australia was 100 per 100,000 person-years (100/100,000/year).
        In SWS, 56.6% of people were overseas-born compared to 29.8% for NSW. The
        age-standardized rate of TIA/stroke for Polynesian-born people was more than
        double that of Australian-born people (p < 0.001). Hypertension (33 [SWS]
        vs. 27/100,000/year [NSW]) and T2DM (36 [SWS] vs. 26/100,000/year [NSW]) were
        the most common risk factors with rates >50/100,000/year (hypertension) and
        >80/100,000/year (T2DM) for people born in Polynesia, Melanesia, and Central
        America. Rates of T2DM, AF, and obesity for Polynesian-born people were over
        threefold greater than people born in Australia. Discussion/Conclusion: Greater
        rates of TIA/stroke were observed in specific CALD communities, with increased
        rates of cerebrovascular risk factors. Culturally specific, targeted interventions
        may bridge health inequalities in cerebrovascular disease.", "venue": "Cerebrovascular

        nausea and vomiting. His medical history included gastric adenocarcinoma with
        curative resection 21-years ago and a 2-year history of a stable sensorimotor
        peripheral neuropathy. During his admission he experienced an episode of new
        onset fluctuating diplopia. Neurological examination demonstrated mild upper
        and lower limb non-fatiguable weakness. There was no detectable cranial nerve
        palsy. A myasthenia antibody panel was ordered. Voltage-gated-calcium-channel-antibodies

        and chest X-ray were consistent with a community acquire pneumonia. He was
        started on a 5-day course of IV ceftriaxone and azithromycin with improvement
        in his symptoms. A CT brain was performed upon presentation given his conscious
        state. This demonstrated a high density in the right globe with tracking along
        the optic nerve and bilateral homogenous isointense spherical masses in the
        frontal horns of the lateral ventricles. Imaging was initially reported as

        reported complication following intraocular silicone endotamponade. The precise
        mechanism of migration is unknown. As silicone appears hyperintense on CT,
        it can mimic a haemorrhage or mass. Cases of misidentification of intraventricular
        silicone have resulted in protracted hospital admissions and surgical biopsy.
        Typical MRI findings and a comprehensive clinical history allow for accurate
        identification. Early and accurate recognition is critical to avoiding unnecessary
        investigation and patient morbidity.", "venue": "Poster abstracts", "year":

        treatment, divergent outcomes", "abstract": "Background Autoimmune encephalitis
        is an increasingly recognised disease that presents with seizures, neuropsychiatric
        symptoms, dystonic movements, and autonomic dysfunction1. As the mainstay
        of treatment immunosuppressive therapies are most effective when subject to
        early initiation and timely escalation, both of which are recognised to affect
        outcomes2. Nevertheless approximately half of patients with NMDA-R antibody
        encephalitis do not respond adequately to first-line therapy, and a significant
        proportion (12-30%) relapse2. Cases A 19 year old lady presented with new-onset
        seizures and psychosis. EEG showed focal spike-and-wave discharges and MRI
        brain a focal area of restricted diffusion consistent with recent seizure
        activity. NMDA-R antibodies were present in both CSF and serum. Following
        early treatment with corticosteroid, plasma exchange, IVIG and rituximab the
        patient recovered, returning to college after 6 months. A 50 year old gentleman
        presented with a two day history of myalgias and confusion. EEG showed spike-and-wave
        discharges and MRI brain increased T2 signal in the mesial temporal lobes.
        NMDA-R antibodies were present in both CSF and serum. He was treated with
        corticosteroid, plasma exchange, IVIG and rituximab, and continued on oral
        prednisone and mycophenolate. Response to treatment was poor with persistent
        ongoing physical and cognitive impairment at 6 months. Serial MRI showed substantial
        (~30%) loss of parenchymal brain volume. Discussion These cases illustrate
        that timely and aggressive management of NMDA-R antibody encephalitis with
        favourable prognostic markers is no guarantee of recovery. Several novel clinical
        and immunological predictors of response to therapy have been postulated,
        and currently await broader validation.3 References Dalmau J, Graus F. Antibody-mediated

        disease (CJD), a spongiform encephalopathy, caused by a transmissible misfolded
        cellular prion protein, is a rapidly progressive, debilitating neurodegenerative
        disorder with no effective treatment. The estimated global incidence is at
        1/million inhabitants. This retrospective study examined the incidence of
        CJD in South Western Sydney Local Health District (SWSLHD) from 2014 to 2020.
        Background: SWSLHD had an estimated population of 1,038,534 in 2020, with
        CJD data being limited. Methods: The New South Wales (NSW) Health Information
        Exchange (HIE) database, for all admissions with CJD diagnoses in SWSLHD,
        between 2014 and 2020, was reviewed according to the WHO diagnostic criteria,
        consistent with the Australian national CJD registry. Only probable CJD cases
        were included. Incidence was calculated based on the projected SWSLHD population.
        Results: Thirty-five patients, diagnosed with CJD, were identified. Each was
        evaluated by 2 independent investigators, including clinical presentation,
        MRI, EEGs, 14-3-3, and RT-QuIC results, before assigning CJD-probable status.
        Four failed the CJD criteria and were excluded. Of the 31 CJD-probable cases,
        most (59%) were male and older (37%, range 61\u201370 years). The incidence
        rate peaked at 9/million in 2017 and was above 2/million, throughout the 7
        years, with an average of 4.859/million/year. Conclusions: The incidence of
        CJD, in SWSLHD, exceeds the national average of 1/million. Cost-effective,
        adequate diagnostic and screening tools, implementable over a large population,
        will become increasingly essential.", "venue": "Neuroepidemiology", "year":

        spontaneous left internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection associated with
        a novel NOTCH1 variant. Case A 43-year-old lady presented with a 3-day history
        of severe headache and transient expressive dysphasia. There was no history
        of preceding trauma. CT brain (CTB) and carotid angiography (CTA) demonstrated
        small areas of established subcortical infarction with occlusion of the M1-segment
        of the left middle cerebral artery (LMCA). CT cerebral perfusion (CTP) displayed
        a region of increased mean transit time and cerebral blood volume consistent
        with a large ischaemic penumbra. Digital subtraction angiography confirmed
        an occlusion of the LMCA with luminal irregularity of the supraclinoid ICA
        suggestive of arterial dissection. An intracranial stent was deployed from
        the superior M2-division of the LMCA to the cavernous ICA. Progress CTA and
        CTP demonstrated reperfusion of the LMCA territory. Six-months later, she
        remains well with no recurrence of symptoms or detectable neurological signs.
        Targeted gene panel demonstrated a novel heterozygous missense variant (c.56C>T;p.Ala19Val)
        in exon-1 of the NOTCH1 gene. Segregation testing demonstrated an identical
        variant in her mother. Conclusion Spontaneous intracranial ICA dissection
        is a rare condition described mostly in single case reports. Mortality rates
        have been reported of up to 75%. The NOTCH-signalling pathway is involved
        in the embryonic development of arterial endothelium. NOTCH1 variants have
        been associated with autosomal dominant bicuspid aortic valve aortopathy,
        and rarely in extracranial arterial dissection. To our knowledge; this is

        (TIA), ischaemic stroke (IS) or intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) with those
        of Caucasians (CSs). Methods: Using a retrospective case-control design, we
        compared PI-born patients with age- and gender-matched CS controls. Consecutive
        patients were admitted to 3 centres in South Western Sydney (July 2013\u2013June
        2020). Demographic and clinical data studied included vascular risk factors,
        stroke subtypes, and imaging characteristics. Results: There were 340 CS,
        183 (27%) IP, and 157 (23%) IF patients; mean age 65 years; and 302 (44.4%)
        female. Of these, 587 and patients presented with TIA/IS and 93 (13.6%) had
        ICH. Both IP and IF patients were significantly more likely to present >24
        h from symptom onset (odds ratios [ORs] vs. CS 1.87 and 2.23). IP patients
        more commonly had body mass indexes >30 (OR 1.94). Current smoking and excess
        alcohol intake were higher in CS. Hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney
        disease were significantly higher in both IP and IF groups in comparison to
        CS. IP patients had higher rates of AF and those with known AF were more commonly
        undertreated than both IF and CS patients (OR 2.24, p = 0.007). ICH was more
        common in IP patients (OR 2.32, p = 0.005), while more IF patients had intracranial

        compare 90-day functional outcomes [modified Rankin Score (mRS) 0-2] and mortality
        in AF vs. non-AF patients receiving EVT; (2) compare 90-day functional outcomes
        and mortality in AF patients on therapeutic vs. non-therapeutic anticoagulation
        receiving EVT; and (3) identify factors influencing outcomes in AF patients
        receiving EVT. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 394 consecutive patients
        who received EVT for anterior cerebral circulation LVO at an Australian comprehensive
        stroke center was performed. The main outcome measures [90-day dichotomized
        mRS (0-2 good; 3-6 poor functional outcome) and mortality] were compared between

        "Background and Purpose: The benefit of bridging intravenous thrombolysis
        (IVT) in acute ischaemic stroke patients eligible for endovascular thrombectomy
        (EVT) is unclear. This may be particularly relevant where reperfusion is achieved
        with multiple thrombectomy passes. We aimed to determine the benefit of bridging
        IVT in first and multiple-pass patients undergoing EVT \u22646 h from stroke
        onset to groin puncture. Methods: We compared 90-day modified Rankin Scale
        (mRS) outcomes in 187 consecutive patients with large vessel occlusions (LVOs)
        of the anterior cerebral circulation who underwent EVT \u22646 h from symptom
        onset and who achieved modified thrombolysis in cerebral ischaemia (mTICI)
        2c/3 reperfusion with the first pass to those patients who required multiple
        passes to achieve reperfusion. The effect of bridging IVT on outcomes was
        examined. Results: Significantly more first-pass patients had favourable (mRS
        0\u20132) 90-day outcomes (68 vs. 42%, p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed
        an association between first-pass reperfusion and favourable outcomes (OR
        2.25; 95% CI 1.08\u20134.68; p = 0.03). IVT provided no additional benefit
        in first-pass patients (OR 1.17; CI 0.42\u20133.20; p = 0.76); however, in
        multiple-pass patients, it reduced the risk of disabling stroke (mRS \u22654)
        (OR 0.30; CI 0.10\u20130.88; p = 0.02) and mortality (OR 0.07; CI 0.01\u20130.36;
        p = 0.002) at 90 days. Conclusion: Bridging IVT may benefit patients with

        "Objective To summarise evidence of the effects of blood pressure (BP)-lowering
        interventions after acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). Methods
        A prespecified systematic review of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
        Trials, EMBASE and MEDLINE databases from inception to 23 June 2020 to identify
        randomised controlled trials that compared active BP-lowering agents versus
        placebo or intensive versus guideline BP-lowering targets for adults <7 days
        after ICH onset. The primary outcome was function (distribution of scores
        on the modified Rankin scale) 90 days after randomisation. Radiological outcomes
        were absolute (>6 mL) and proportional (>33%) haematoma growth at 24 hours.
        Meta-analysis used a one-stage approach, adjusted using generalised linear
        mixed models with prespecified covariables and trial as a random effect. Results
        Of 7094 studies identified, 50 trials involving 11 494 patients were eligible
        and 16 (32.0%) shared patient-level data from 6221 (54.1%) patients (mean
        age 64.2 [SD 12.9], 2266 [36.4%] females) with a median time from symptom
        onset to randomisation of 3.8 hours (IQR 2.6\u20135.3). Active/intensive BP-lowering
        interventions had no effect on the primary outcome compared with placebo/guideline
        treatment (adjusted OR for unfavourable shift in modified Rankin scale scores:
        0.97, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.06; p=0.50), but there was significant heterogeneity
        by strategy (pinteraction=0.031) and agent (pinteraction<0.0001). Active/intensive
        BP-lowering interventions clearly reduced absolute (>6 ml, adjusted OR 0.75,
        95%CI 0.60 to 0.92; p=0.0077) and relative (\u226533%, adjusted OR 0.82, 95%CI
        0.68 to 0.99; p=0.034) haematoma growth. Interpretation Overall, a broad range
        of interventions to lower BP within 7 days of ICH onset had no overall benefit
        on functional recovery, despite reducing bleeding. The treatment effect appeared
        to vary according to strategy and agent. PROSPERO registration number CRD42019141136.",

        anterior circulation stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO), recent data
        suggest that successful reperfusion (mTICI\u22652b) after a single device
        pass results in more favourable functional outcomes in comparison to patients
        requiring multiple passes. It is unclear if this effect represents an epiphenomenon
        or a true independent effect.\n \n \n Methods:\n A prospectively maintained
        database of EVT was interrogated for patients presenting with anterior circulation
        LVO with onset to groin puncture times of \u2264 6 hours from January 2016
        to March 2019. Three-month functional outcomes were compared between first-pass
        reperfusion and multiple-pass reperfusion patients using logistic regression.\n
        \n \n Results:\n A total of 169 patients were identified (mean age 71 yrs,
        44% female, median NIHSS 17, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in 47%). Successful
        reperfusion (mTICI\u22652b) was achieved with the first-pass (FP) in 80 patients
        (47%) and multiple-passes (MP) in 89 patients (53%). First pass patients had
        better outcomes when compared to MP patients (mRS 0-2 71% vs 31%, p < 0.001).
        No difference in functional outcomes was seen between FP patients who received
        IVT and those that did not (mRS 0-2 68% vs 75%, p = 0.459). Multiple-pass
        patients who received IVT achieved higher rates of functional independence
        than those who did not (mRS 0-2 40% vs 27%, p = 0.035).\n \n \n Conclusion:\n
        Intravenous thrombolysis may improve functional recovery in EVT patients requiring
        multiple-passes to achieve reperfusion. Prospective studies should be considered.\n",

        Design, setting and participants This is an analysis of a prospective database
        of consecutive patients undergoing EVT for LVO presenting between January
        2017 and December 2018 at a single Australian comprehensive stroke centre
        (CSC). Patients presented directly or were transferred to the CSC from 21

        Transferred patients had worse 90-day functional outcome (39.6% vs 61.0%,
        OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.78), higher mortality (25.3% vs 6.8%, OR 4.66, CI

        (298 min vs 205\u2009min, p<0.01). Successful reperfusion rates and sICH were
        similar between the cohorts (96.8% vs 98.3%, and 7.8% vs 3.4%). Conclusion
        Interhospital transfer is associated with longer stroke onset to treatment,

        "Introduction We report a case of adult Leigh syndrome resulting in rapidly
        fatal cerebellar oedema. Case A 19-year-old female presented with a five-week
        history of hyperventilation, generalised weakness, dysarthria and bilateral
        ptosis. Brain Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and the presence of
        a mitochondrial mutation (NC_012920.1(MT-ATP6):m.9176T>C) in blood and urine
        with approximately 97% heteroplasmy, confirmed a diagnosis of Leigh syndrome.
        Two-days after a normal lumbar puncture, opening pressure 8cm water, her conscious
        level rapidly declined. CT revealed marked cerebellar oedema with brainstem
        compression. Despite immediate decompression, she did not recover consciousness
        and died six-weeks after symptom onset. Conclusion Adult Leigh syndrome is
        a progressive untreatable inherited mitochondrial disorder typically of infants
        and children. Adult cases are rare and described mostly in single case reports.
        There is marked phenotypic and genotypic variability. Over 83% of Leigh\u2019s
        syndrome is identified by the age of 2 years, however, there have been cases
        reported in patients up to 74 years old. There are over 60 mutations described
        in Leigh syndrome, which are identified in only half of reported cases. Classic
        MRI changes include bilateral symmetric T2 hyper-intensities in the basal
        ganglia and brainstem. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case resulting
        in fulminant cerebellar oedema. A challenge of diagnosis remains the marked
        heterogeneity in presenting symptoms including cognitive decline, behavioural
        change and ophthalmoparesis. Typically, this syndrome has been confirmed by
        histopathology at autopsy. Advances in genetics and imaging have allowed earlier
        accurate diagnosis, potentially paving the way for improved therapeutics.",

        cord in vitamin B12-replete recreational nitrous oxide abusers", "abstract":
        "Introduction Within a few years of its discovery in late 18th century, nitrous
        oxide was being used recreationally for its pleasurable effects. It remains
        in widespread use as an inhaled stimulant today, and can be legally acquired
        in bulk quantities with relative ease. In the body prolonged exposure to nitrous
        oxide leads to the oxidization of vitamin B12, rendering it unusable in key
        enzymatic reactions necessary for myelin synthesis. Over time this qualitative
        deficiency leads to a central demyelination syndrome that characteristically
        develops despite normal serum vitamin B12 levels and, with continued exposure
        to nitrous oxide, resists treatment with vitamin B12 supplementation. Method
        Nitrous oxide abusers presenting with a central demyelination syndrome were
        enrolled in this case series. Serum levels of vitamin B12, active B12, folate
        and homocysteine were measured. Nitrous oxide exposure was discontinued, and
        all patients were treated in accordance with evidence-based guidelines. Results
        Eight patients presented with predominantly moderate-to-severe clinical deficits.
        The majority were vitamin B12 replete. In most cases individuals had actively
        engaged in prolonged vitamin B12 supplementation in an attempt to circumvent
        the harmful pathophysiology, of which they were loosely aware. Following treatment
        and rehabilitation several patients were discharged into full-time care, and
        most had significant residual disability at follow-up. Conclusions This case
        series not only illustrates the tragic consequences of abuse of this widely
        available and legally procured stimulant, but also highlights the futility
        of pursuing a nominally \u2018protective\u2019 strategy of vitamin B12 supplementation
        in the context of continued nitrous oxide exposure.", "venue": "Journal of

        hypercapnic respiratory failure", "abstract": "Introduction We report a case
        of LOPD with acute-on-chronic respiratory failure. Case A 57 year-old retired
        farmer presented with obtundation requiring intubation. He reported a 4 month
        history of hypophonia, intermittent diplopia, lethargy and orthopnea. Initial
        arterial blood gas measurement displayed acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory
        failure (pH 7.19, pO2 98 mmHg, pCO2 112 mmHg, HCO3 43 mmol/L). Muscle biopsy
        was suggestive of LOPD with myofibres demonstrating acid phosphatase and periodic
        acid-schiff positive vacuoles. Diagnosis was confirmed with low \u03b1-glucosidase
        activity on dried blood spot (0.4umol/h/L) and elevated urinary tetrasaccharide
        level (5 mmol/mol creatinine). Mutation analysis of the GAA gene demonstrated
        two known pathogenic mutations (c.-32\u201313T>G and c.1075+1G>T). With improved
        ventilation, he was able to be extubated. The only respiratory support on
        discharge was overnight bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation. Conclusion
        LOPD is a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency
        in acid \u03b1-glucosidase. This leads to intra-lysomal accumulation of glycogen
        in tissues. Particularly in the late form, there is significant phenotypic
        variability.1 Diagnosis remains challenging. Cases have been reported with
        a range of initial symptoms including stroke,2 syncope3 and chronic respiratory
        failure.4 Acute on chronic respiratory failure at presentation is rare. Enzyme
        replacement therapy has been shown to improve both morbidity and mortality
        in LOPD.5 Earlier treatment is associated with better outcomes.6 Prompt recognition
        of cases is paramount. Unexplained acute-on-chronic respiratory failure should
        raise the possibility of this condition. In such cases, management of ventilation
        is vital. References Chan J, et al. The emerging phenotype of late-onset Pompe

        "Introduction NMDAR encephalitis is an autoimmune condition with antibodies
        to the NR1 subunit of the NMDAR. It has a variable clinical presentation with
        behavioural and psychiatric symptoms. There is frequently a relapsing course.
        A known association exists with tumours, particularly ovarian teratoma. Cases
        which are not associated with tumour often fail first line therapy. As such,
        therapy for this disease can be challenging and involves a spectrum of immunotherapy.
        Rituximab is widely considered to be second line treatment for this illness.
        We present two cases of refractory anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Cases Both patients
        were confirmed antibody positive in the serum and cerebral spinal fluid. There
        was no tumour identified on whole body positron emission tomography and transvaginal
        pelvic ultrasound. Each patient was initially treated with first line therapy
        of intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis and methylprednisolone with
        limited symptomatic improvement. Second line therapy of two doses of rituximab
        was administered intravenously two weeks apart at a dose of 1000\u2009mg.
        Mycophenolate mofetil was used at a dose of 1000\u2009mg twice daily to minimise
        B-cell reconstitution. Response to treatment was monitored with measurement
        of CD 19+ Pan B cells in peripheral blood and clinical assessment by the consultant
        liaison psychiatry service. Both patients demonstrated significant response
        with undetectable CD 19+ Pan B cells on serial testing and sustained clinical
        improvement in initial behavioural symptoms. Conclusion In patients with anti-NMDAR
        encephalitis, rituximab combined with maintenance mycophenolate mofetil may
        be an effective treatment.", "venue": "Journal of Neurology Neurosurgery &

        for Environmental Chemicals", "abstract": "Recent international efforts have
        led to proposals for modified carcinogenicity testing paradigms based on data
        from shorter-term studies. The main goal of the current study was to evaluate
        the negative predictive value (NPV) of short-term toxicity indicators on carcinogenicity
        study outcomes and cancer classifications for chemicals previously reviewed
        by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Pathology data were analyzed
        from over 900 acceptable 2-sex guideline subchronic (3-month) and carcinogenicity
        studies in the U.S. EPA Toxicity Reference Database. Chemical cancer classifications
        were obtained from annual reports of the U.S. EPA Office of Pesticide Programs.
        Histopathologic risk signals and evidence of hormonal perturbation in subchronic
        rat studies provided 56% NPV for any tumor outcome in the rat or mouse and
        75% NPV for cancer classifications not requiring quantitative risk assessment
        (qRA). In comparison, lack of activity in a battery of 35 in vitro cytotoxicity
        assays from the U.S. EPA ToxCast library provided 49% NPV for any tumor outcome
        and 80% NPV for cancer classifications not requiring qRA. These findings support
        the idea that the absence of short-term bioactivity may provide useful information
        for prioritizing chemicals based on potential carcinogenic risk. Additional
        data streams are needed to further refine these models.", "venue": "Toxicological

        "title": "Toward a checklist for exchange and interpretation of data from
        a toxicology study.", "abstract": "Data from toxicology and toxicogenomics
        studies are valuable, and can be combined for meta-analysis using public data
        repositories such as Chemical Effects in Biological Systems Knowledgebase,
        ArrayExpress, and Gene Expression Omnibus. In order to fully utilize the data
        for secondary analysis, it is necessary to have a description of the study
        and good annotation of the accompanying data. This study annotation permits
        sophisticated cross-study comparison and analysis, and allows data from comparable
        subjects to be identified and fully understood. The Minimal Information About
        a Microarray Experiment Standard was proposed to permit deposition and sharing
        of microarray data. We propose the first step toward an analogous standard
        for a toxicogenomics/toxicology study, by describing a checklist of information
        that best practices would suggest be included with the study data. When the
        information in this checklist is deposited together with the study data, the
        checklist information helps the public explore the study data in context of
        time, or identify data from similarly treated subjects, and also explore/identify
        potential sources of experimental variability. The proposed checklist summarizes
        useful information to include when sharing study data for publication, deposition
        into a database, or electronic exchange with collaborators. It is not a description
        of how to carry out an experiment, but a definition of how to describe an
        experiment. It is anticipated that once a toxicology checklist is accepted
        and put into use, then toxicology databases can be configured to require and
        output these fields, making it straightforward to annotate data for interpretation

        maps each gate or \\node\" in the new circuit into one in the old circuit
        (if a matching does not exist it maps it to null). We present both an exact
        and a heuristic way to solve the maximal matching problem. The matching problem
        does not require any input correspondences. The purpose is to identify structurally
        identical regions in the networks, and exploit the commonality between them
        for more eecient ver-iication and synthesis. Synthesis and veriication tools
        that recognize commonalities both between two versions of the same design,
        as well within a single design, may be able to outperform their counterparts
        that do not utilize these commonalities. This work is concerned with detecting

        "title": "Reduced electronic spaces for modeling donor/acceptor interactions.",
        "abstract": "Diabatic states for donor (D) and acceptor (A) interactions in
        electron transfer (ET) processes are formulated and evaluated, along with
        coupling elements (H(DA)) and effective D/A separation distances (r(DA)),
        for reduced electronic spaces of variable size, using the generalized Mulliken
        Hush model (GMH), applicable to an arbitrary state space and nuclear configuration,
        and encompassing Robin-Day class III and as well as class II situations. Once
        the electronic state space is selected (a set of n \u2265 2 adiabatic states
        approximated by an orbital space based on an effective 1-electron (1-e) Hamiltonian),
        the charge-localized GMH diabatic states are obtained as the eigenstates of
        the dipole moment operator, with rotations to yield locally adiabatic states
        for sites with multiple states. The 1-e states and energies are expressed
        in terms of Kohn-Sham orbitals and orbital energies. Addressing questions
        as to whether the estimate of H(DA) \"improves\" as one increases n, and in
        what sense the GMH approach \"converges\" with n, we carry out calculations
        for three mixed-valence binuclear Ru complexes, from which we conclude that
        the 2-state (2-st) model gives the most appropriate estimate of the effective
        coupling, similar (to within a rms deviation of \u226415%) to coupling elements
        obtained by superexchange correction of H(DA) values based on larger spaces
        (n = 3-6), and thus yielding a quasi-invariant value for H(DA) over the range
        explored in the calculations (n = 2-6). An analysis of the coupling and associated
        D and A states shows that the 2-st coupling involves crucial mixing with intervening
        bridge states (D and A \"tails\"), while increasingly larger state spaces
        for the same system yield increasingly more localized D and A states (and
        weaker coupling), with H(DA) tending to approach the limit of \"bare\" or
        \"through space\" coupling. These results help to reconcile seemingly contradictory
        assertions in the recent literature regarding the proper role of multistate
        frameworks in the formulation of coupling for both intra- and intermolecular
        ET systems.The present results are compared in detail with other reported

        limited features and sparse examples in noisy highly periodic data", "abstract":
        "Google uses continuous streams of data from industry partners in order to
        deliver accurate results to users. Unexpected drops in traffic can be an indication
        of an underlying issue and may be an early warning that remedial action may
        be necessary. Detecting such drops is non-trivial because streams are variable
        and noisy, with roughly regular spikes (in many different shapes) in traffic
        data. We investigated the question of whether or not we can predict anomalies
        in these data streams. Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning and statistical
        approaches to classify anomalous drops in periodic, but noisy, traffic patterns.
        Since we do not have a large body of labeled examples to directly apply supervised
        learning for anomaly classification, we approached the problem in two parts.
        First we used TensorFlow to train our various models including DNNs, RNNs,
        and LSTMs to perform regression and predict the expected value in the time
        series. Secondly we created anomaly detection rules that compared the actual
        values to predicted values. Since the problem requires finding sustained anomalies,
        rather than just short delays or momentary inactivity in the data, our two
        detection methods focused on continuous sections of activity rather than just
        single points. We tried multiple combinations of our models and rules and
        found that using the intersection of our two anomaly detection methods proved
        to be an effective method of detecting anomalies on almost all of our models.
        In the process we also found that not all data fell within our experimental
        assumptions, as one data stream had no periodicity, and therefore no time
        based model could predict it.", "venue": "arXiv.org", "year": 2017, "referenceCount":

        and Surveillance via the Internet", "abstract": "The communication of data
        between various operator and service company data stores has long been problematic.
        Fragile, low bandwidth lines of communication coupled with a lack of standards
        have left serious efficiency gaps in the movement of data from the acquisition
        location to decisionmaking and interpretation centers. Various systems have
        been developed and deployed to minimize these difficulties; however, all have
        fallen short of industry requirements. Recent availability of more robust,
        higher bandwidth lines between locations has led to a new standard of communication
        called Wellsite Information Transfer Standard Markup Language (WITSML). Using
        this new technology, data can be acquired and transmitted synchronously or
        asynchronously among multiple stakeholders with limited effort. The ability
        to mix and match various data collection vendors and connect these data sources
        to interpreters and modelers with limited effort is creating new opportunities
        to improve the success and efficiency of remote operations. This paper reviews
        four cases that demonstrate the use of WITSML to synchronously transmit real-time
        data from domestic and international offshore locations to onshore sites.
        The cases clearly demonstrate that WITSML meets previously neglected industry

        processing problem is instead related to alexithymia, which frequently co-occurs
        with ASD. By combining predictive coding theories of ASD and simulation theories
        of emotion recognition, it is suggested that facial mimicry may improve the
        training of FEER in ASD and alexithymia. Objective: This study aims to evaluate
        a novel mimicry task to improve FEER in adults with and without ASD and alexithymia.
        Additionally, this study will aim to determine the contributions of alexithymia
        and ASD to FEER ability and assess which of these 2 populations benefit from
        this training task. Methods: Recruitment will primarily take place through
        an ASD community group with emphasis put on snowball recruiting. Included
        will be 64 consenting adults equally divided between participants without
        an ASD and participants with an ASD. Participants will be screened online
        using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K-10; cut-off score of 22),
        Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ-10), and Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) followed
        by a clinical interview with a provisional psychologist at the Federation
        University psychology clinic. The clinical interview will include assessment
        of ability, anxiety, and depression as well as discussion of past ASD diagnosis
        and confirmatory administration of the Autism Mental Status Exam (AMSE). Following
        the clinical interview, the participant will complete the Bermond-Vorst Alexithymia
        Questionnaire (BVAQ) and then undertake a baseline assessment of FEER. Consenting
        participants will then be assigned using a permuted blocked randomization
        method into either the control task condition or the mimicry task condition.
        A brief measure of satisfaction of the task and a debriefing session will
        conclude the study. Results: The study has Federation University Human Research
        Ethics Committee approval and is registered with the Australian New Zealand
        Clinical Trials. Participant recruitment is predicted to begin in the third
        quarter of 2021. Conclusions: This study will be the first to evaluate the
        use of a novel facial mimicry task condition to increase FEER in adults with
        ASD and alexithymia. If efficacious, this task could prove useful as a cost-effective
        adjunct intervention that could be used at home and thus remove barriers to
        entry. This study will also explore the unique effectiveness of this task
        in people without an ASD, with an ASD, and with alexithymia. Trial Registration:

        THREE MEDITATION TECHNIQUES", "abstract": "The aim of this study was to record
        experiences of three meditation conditions: Ratio Breathing, Transcendental
        Meditation and Zazen, with special reference to sport, health, neuro-physiology
        and sense of coherence. The participants (N=9), seven males and two females
        were all British, actively competing across a range of individual and team
        sports, with no experience of using meditation techniques or practices in
        their sporting or daily lives. Their mean age was 31.56 years with an age
        range of 22 to 44 years. The study employed a within-subjects, repeated measures
        design, with each participant practising each meditation condition in a randomly
        counterbalanced order. Integrative findings support the value of all three
        meditation conditions for health and to a lesser extent for sport, especially
        with regard to their effect on focus. All three meditation conditions were
        associated with a decrease in respiration. The differential effect of the
        meditations was apparent. Participants valued Ratio breathing for its effect
        on concentration, Transcendental Meditation for its depth of meditation and
        Zazen for its effect on self and removal of external distractions. These qualitative
        findings were associated with differentially significant quantitative effects
        on lowered respiration rate in the Ratio Breathing group, increased physical
        relaxation and alpha activity in the Transcendental Meditation group, and
        increases in both alpha and theta activity in the Zazen group.", "venue":

        of GSK2878175 administered as single and repeat oral doses (once daily for

        mandates parallel programming. While parallelism presents a panoply of problems,
        few are as pernicious and prevalent as nondeterminism, in which the output
        of a program is affected by more than just its inputs, e.g., uncontrollable
        scheduling choices made by the operating system. A few parallel languages
        do guarantee determinism, but do so through draconian restrictions. It is
        time for a new era of bug-free parallel programming that will enable programmers
        to shift easily from sequential to parallel worlds. We propose a determinizing
        compiler: starting from a non-deterministic program, our compiler inserts
        just enough additional synchronization to guarantee deterministic behavior,
        even in the presence of nondeterministic scheduling choices. A brute-force
        solution would simply generate sequential code, but our compiler will strive
        to preserve parallelism to impose a minimal loss of performance.", "venue":

        Multistep Approach.", "abstract": "PURPOSE\nTo describe the successful implementation
        of a structured reporting initiative in a large urban academic radiology department.\n\n\nMETHODS\nWe
        describe our process, compromises, and top 10 lessons learned in overhauling
        traditional reporting practices and comprehensively implementing structured
        reporting at our institution. To achieve our goals, we took deliberate steps
        toward consensus building, undertook multistep template refinement, and achieved
        close collaboration with the technical staff, department coders, and hospital
        information technologists. Following institutional review board exemption,
        we audited radiologist compliance by evaluating 100 consecutive cases of 12
        common examination types. Fisher exact test was applied to determine significance
        of association between trainee initial report drafting and template compliance.\n\n\nRESULTS\nWe
        produced and implemented structured reporting templates for 95% of all departmental
        computed tomography, magnetic resonance, and ultrasound examinations. Structured
        templates include specialized reports adhering to the American College of
        Radiology''s Reporting and Data Systems (ACR''s RADS) recommendations (eg,
        Lung-RADS and Li-RADS). We attained 94% radiologist compliance within 2 years,
        without any financial incentives.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe provide a blueprint
        of how to successfully achieve structured reporting using a collaborative
        multistep approach.", "venue": "Current problems in diagnostic radiology",

        evaluation of the urinary tract?", "abstract": "Technologic advances in both
        computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have resulted
        in the ability to image the urinary tract in ways that surpass the prior mainstay
        of urinary tract imaging, the intravenous urogram. In adults, for most, if
        not all, historical indications for intravenous urography, CT urography or
        MR urography is now the preferred examination. Although a variety of techniques
        for both examinations have been described, each test provides more diagnostic
        information than does intravenous urography. With the introduction of multidetector
        technology, CT urography, to date, has emerged as the initial heir apparent
        to intravenous urography; many years of experience have now clearly demonstrated
        that CT is the test of choice for many urologic problems, including urolithiasis,
        renal masses, urinary tract infection, trauma, and obstructive uropathy. CT
        urography provides a detailed anatomic depiction of each of the major portions
        of the urinary tract--the kidneys, intrarenal collecting systems, ureters,
        and bladder--and thus allows patients with hematuria to be evaluated comprehensively.
        MR urography can be used also to evaluate the urinary tract and has the advantage
        of not using ionizing radiation and the potential to provide more functional
        information than CT. However, MR urography is less established and less reliably
        results in diagnostic image quality relative to CT urography. Although both
        tests can be used to evaluate the urinary tract, several issues remain and
        include reaching a consensus on the optimal protocols and appropriate utilization
        in an era of cost containment and heightened concerns about radiation exposure.",

        "To the Editor: In the August 27 issue, the arti\u00ad cle by Fazel et al.1
        and the accompanying Perspec\u00ad tive article by Lauer2 create an opportunity
        for the medical community to learn more about the work of radiation protection
        professionals: medi\u00ad cal physicists and diagnostic radiologists. Radiol\u00ad
        ogists are the only physicians who receive sub\u00ad stantive training in
        radiation biology and safety that is linked to their board certification.
        Radiolo\u00ad gists are most knowledgeable in managing and minimizing radiation
        exposures associated with medical imaging, and they can recommend sonog\u00ad
        raphy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as alternatives to ionizing imaging.3
        In a 2009 re\u00ad port,4 the National Council on Radiation Protec\u00ad tion
        and Measurements, which was chartered by Congress, provided a comprehensive
        analysis of medical and all other sources of ionizing radia\u00ad tion to
        which the American public was exposed. The medical community should work together
        across disciplines to use existing knowledge about radiation protection to
        ensure that imaging is warranted and optimized. When patients do need imaging,
        they should ask if the imaging center is accredited, the imaging personnel
        are creden\u00ad tialed, and the protocols used are weight\u00adbased and

        of the more complex requirements.", "abstract": "AJR:190, January 2008 125
        pages. Many of the comments expressed concern regarding the new requirement
        for 12 months of training in diagnostic radiology before a resident is allowed
        to stand independent in-house calls, while others supported the RRC on this
        controversial issue. The RRC prepared responses to all comments; a single
        response was prepared to groups of comments that were of a similar nature.
        Based on the comments received regarding 12 months of training before residents
        are allowed to stand independent calls, the RRC revised the original wording
        of this requirement to clarify its intent that it indeed pertains only to
        independent call situations. It was not the intent of the RRC for this requirement
        to dictate policies regarding resident supervision during normal working hours
        when there presumably is a full complement of radiology faculty present. Furthermore,
        appreciating the difficulty that programs might experience in modifying call
        schedules given a July 2007 implementation date, the RRC opted to delay implementation
        of all the new requirements until July 1, 2008. Minor changes also were made
        to a few other proposed requirements based on the comments received. The RRC
        had proposed that residents be allowed to rotate up to 15 months in a single
        subspecialty, but as that was noted to be in conflict with current ABR requirements,
        the requirement was rewritten to continue the current limitation of such rotations
        to 12 months. To clarify the requirement regarding the faculty member responsible
        for pediatric radiology, a statement in the current program requirements,

        parous women.", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nIncompetent and dilated ovarian veins
        have been reported in association with pelvic congestion syndrome. We postulate
        that incompetent and dilated ovarian veins are often an incidental CT finding,
        with a low diagnostic value. To verify our hypothesis, we studied the frequency
        of incompetent and dilated ovarian veins seen on CT in asymptomatic women.\n\n\nMATERIALS
        AND METHODS\nWe retrospectively analyzed helical CT scans and medical records
        of 34 consecutive female renal donors between 18 and 46 years old (mean age,
        33 years). An incompetent and dilated ovarian vein was defined as a contrast-filled
        vein measuring 7 mm or greater, seen during the arterial phase of helical
        CT.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIncompetent and dilated ovarian veins were found in 16 (47%)
        of 34 asymptomatic women. All 16 women had left ovarian vein involvement;
        six (37.5%) had bilateral involvement. The mean diameters for the left and
        right (incompetent and dilated) ovarian veins were 9.1 mm and 8.8 mm, respectively
        (range, 7-12 mm). Of 16 women with incompetent and dilated ovarian veins,
        15 (94%) were parous. Of 18 women with normal ovarian veins, nine (50%) were
        parous. Overall, incompetent and dilated ovarian veins were found in 15 (63%)
        of 24 parous women, and in one (10%) of 10 nonparous women (p < 0.05).\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIncompetent
        and dilated ovarian veins are frequently seen on CT in asymptomatic parous
        women. As an isolated finding, it is unlikely to be associated with pelvic
        congestion syndrome.", "venue": "AJR. American journal of roentgenology",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE\nA 1-year program was undertaken in conjunction with
        an outside consultant to cut nonphysician labor expenses by 15%, cut nonlabor
        expenses by 10%, and improve all service parameters in an academic radiology
        department.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nA steering committee decided on five
        major goal teams: improve report turnaround time and improve patient throughput,
        increase the efficiency of performance and improve the quality of radiologic
        examinations, decrease the cost of each examination, improve charge capture,
        and improve the perception of the department. The goal teams met at least
        every 2 weeks, made presentations to the steering committee at midyear, and
        were then disbanded. The steering committee implemented changes in the second
        half of the year and continues to meet every 2 weeks. Data were obtained from
        the radiology information system, financial statements, and surveys.\n\n\nRESULTS\nIn
        the first year, report turnaround time decreased from 157 hr to 83 hr (and
        to 46 hr at 2 years), the efficiency of performing examinations (according
        to our criteria) improved from 64% to 80%, the quality of examinations improved,
        labor costs were reduced by 5% (and by 11% at 2 years), nonlabor costs were
        reduced by 14% (and by 31% at 2 years), cost per examination was reduced by
        10% (and by 16% at 2 years), increased charge capture resulted in an annual
        increase in professional fees of at least $110,000, and the perception of
        the department by referring clinicians improved.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIt is possible
        to simultaneously cut expenses and improve service. To gauge progress, objective
        parameters that can be measured easily are necessary.", "venue": "AJR. American

        define computed tomographic (CT) features of cystic adrenal lesions that differentiate
        them from similar-appearing adenoma.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nCT scans
        of 13 cystic adrenal lesions (four endothelial cysts, three benign pseudocysts,
        one nonspecific benign cyst, one carcinoma, one pheochromocytoma, and three
        stable lesions with no histologic diagnosis) were analyzed retrospectively.
        Reports in the literature of 26 benign adrenal cysts were also reviewed.\n\n\nRESULTS\nMean
        lesion diameter was 6.2 cm, and six lesions were less than 5.0 cm. Mean attenuation
        values was 21 HU, and in eight cases it was less than 15 HU. Partial adrenal
        involvement was noted in six cases. Ten lesions contained wall or septal calcification.
        Wall thickness was 3 mm or less in nine and exceeded 6 mm in three lesions;
        one of the latter was cystic carcinoma. Wall enhancement (but no intralesional
        enhancement) was found in two of six lesions. Of 37 reviewed benign cysts,
        19 had mural and seven had central calcification, 28 were unilocular, and
        seven had high attenuation value. Wall thickness was 3 mm or less in 31 lesions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCT
        findings of a nonenhancing mass with or without wall calcification allow differentiation
        of adrenal cyst from adenoma. A small adrenal cyst with near-water attenuation
        and a thin (< or = 3-mm) wall is likely to be benign.", "venue": "Radiology",

        school radiology clerkships were quantified. METHODSQuestionnaires were sent
        to 126 medical school radiology departments in the United States. Queries
        were made regarding length and requirements for clerkships, methods of teaching,
        methods of student evaluation, and responsibility for these functions. RESULTSFifty-seven
        responses (45%) were received. Methods of student teaching varied, but most
        departments relied on readout sessions, watching procedures, \u201cshow-and-tell\u201d
        sessions, didactic slide and film presentations, and various other methods.
        Emphasis of most student clerkships was placed on teaching imaging disease
        processes rather than on how to read x-rays. A written examination was most
        commonly used to evaluate student performance. Most teaching was done by fulltime
        faculty, with lesser contributions from part-time faculty, fellows, and residents.

        "RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES.Iopromide is a nonionic monomeric contrast agent.
        Initial laboratory and clinical data have shown that it is relatively safe.
        Efficacy for excretory urography has been shown to be good, comparable with
        other lowosmolality agents. The authors attempted to confirm these impressions
        in a randomized, double-blind comparison with equivalent doses of ioversol
        and iopamidol. METHODS.Two hundred adult patients undergoing excretory urography
        were studied. One hundred received iopromide, 40 received ioversol, and 60
        received iopamidol (300 mg I/kg) as an intravenous bolus. Urographic films
        (obtained 1, 5, 15, and 20 minutes after the bolus, and postvoid) were interpreted
        by an observer blinded to contrast type. Visualization of renal parenchyma,
        pelvis and calyces, ureters, and bladder was independently assessed as excellent,
        good, poor, or nonvisualized. Vital signs were recorded before, 30 to 60 minutes
        after, and 24 hours after injection. Adverse reactions were sought, physical
        examinations were performed, and standard hematology and serum chemistry values
        were measured before and 1 day after injection; a 72-hour serum creatinine
        level was also measured. RESULTS.Ninety-eight percent of visualization scores
        were good or excellent; no significant differences among iopromide, iopamidol,
        and ioversol were found, nor were there any significant differences among
        groups in vital signs. Only one patient experienced a contrast-related physical
        examination change (subcutaneous extravasation). No significant changes with
        regard to hematology or serum chemistry values were observed; there was no
        contrast-induced nephropathy. Mild adverse reactions were experienced by 10%
        of patients; there were no significant differences in reaction rates among
        contrast agents. CONCLUSIONS.Iopromide at a dose of approximately 300 mg I/kg
        is safe and effective as an excretory urographic agent and is comparable in
        performance with ioversol and iopamidol.", "venue": "Investigative Radiology",

        "An ROC study was performed to evaluate the effect of quadtree-based data
        compression on the diagnostic yield of CT images. Seventy images were selected
        from a series of consecutive abdominal/pelvic CT scans. Following the application
        of quadtree-based compression, all images were reviewed independently by three
        radiologists. The images were analyzed at six decreasing irreversible compression
        ratios (30.6:1 to 7.4:1), as well as after reversible compression (2.9:1).
        ROC curves reveal a gradual decrease in clinical accuracy with increasing
        compression ratios. At a compression ratio of 7.4:1, sensitivity for all major
        abnormalities was 99% with a specificity of 93%. As the compression ratio
        was increased to 30.6:1, sensitivity and specificity dropped to 75% and 83%
        respectively. Execution times for compression and decompression of the CT
        images with a PC-AT based digital radiography system varied from 24.7 to 18.5
        seconds and from 16.2 to 5.1 seconds respectively, decreasing with higher

        area provide a context for each examination. Answers are given during the

        and answer sheets are collected. Attendance is high. Test scores are routinely
        lower than in other forms of evaluation. Testing integrates all aspects of
        radiology training from cognitive through deductive, simulates written consultations,

        Mainz, Penn, and King techniques). The optimum pouch protects the upper tracts
        by prevention of reflux, provides urinary continence, and has sufficient capacity
        to require catheterization no more frequently than every 3-6 hours. Simplified
        construction techniques for the commonly encountered pouches are graphically

        "The urographic findings of focal clubbing of the renal calices and associated
        parenchymal scarring usually prompt a diagnosis of chronic pyelonephritis,
        which is frequently thought to be due to ongoing or previous vesicoureteral
        reflux. However, we noticed that upper tract stone disease appeared to be
        the condition that most often preceded or accompanied caliceal clubbing and
        parenchymal scarring in adults. To test the hypothesis that stones were the
        most common cause of this renal abnormality, we analyzed the IV urograms in
        1500 consecutive patients for evidence of upper tract stone disease, vesicoureteral
        reflux, and caliceal clubbing and scarring. Of 39 patients with clubbing and
        scarring, 67% had stone disease, but only 8% had a history of reflux. Of 90
        patients with stone disease, 29% had clubbing and scarring. We conclude that,
        in adults, upper tract stone disease may be the most important etiologic factor
        in the production of renal caliceal clubbing and scarring.", "venue": "AJR.

        "abstract": "Ultrasound (US) is often employed as a screening test for hydronephrosis
        in the nondiverted kidney and has been used recently to evaluate the diverted
        kidney, specifically ileal loops, for obstruction. The utility of US in evaluating
        obstruction in patients with ileal loops has apparently not been previously
        explored. During a 2-year period, 87 kidneys drained by an ileal loop diversion
        were examined with US because of clinical indications of possible renal obstruction.
        In 33 kidneys, no hydronephrosis was seen on sonograms, and no obstruction
        was later proved; in 51 kidneys, shown by US to be hydronephrotic, only 19
        (37%) were obstructed. Three left kidneys were not visualized with US. The
        percentage of hydronephrotic kidneys subsequently shown to be obstructed increased
        rapidly as the US appearance progressed from grade 1 (20%) to grade 3 (80%).
        In this series, US had a 100% sensitivity and a 50% specificity in evaluating
        patients with ileal loops for renal obstruction. Thus, for the adult patient,
        a direct contrast evaluation of the collecting system is suggested; for the
        pediatric patient, initial use of US is justified as a means to avoid radiation
        exposure.", "venue": "Radiology", "year": 1986, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        urinary tract obstruction. However, this finding may appear in the absence
        of obstruction. Experiments were performed with cylinders containing meglumine
        iothalamate, which were perfused with water and imaged. The effects of (a)
        varying flow rate, (b) different volumes of the cylinders, and (c) presence
        of obstruction on the rate of contrast material washout were observed. In
        addition, postoperative urography and ureteral perfusion studies in 6 patients
        who had had ureteropelvic junction obstruction successfully treated by pyeloplasty
        were reviewed. In the experiments, it was found that changes in flow rate
        and volume of the reservoir affected contrast material washout; however, the
        presence of obstruction did not cause a delay in washout. Three of the 6 patients
        had delayed washout of contrast material on postoperative urographic studies,
        although ureteral perfusion studies had excluded obstruction. Additional mechanisms

        underwent this procedure. A solid renal mass was detected in each of the seven

        radiologic diagnostic techniques originally yielded results that suggested
        a renal or adrenal origin. In two other cases, masses thought to originate
        from the spleen or retroperitoneum were shown by CT to be renal tumors. In
        a sixth case, a large mass thought to be of renal origin but not evaluated
        by CT was found at surgery to be a pancreatic cyst. Abdominal CT is more sensitive

        component of the mixed solvent as the proportions of the components continually

        data and are used in conjunction with the discussion of the rates. The order
        of the rates of hydrolyses of the ethyl alpha -multihalogen-substituted esters
        was explained on the basis of inductive effects, while the order of the rates
        of hydrolyses of the ethyl alpha -monohaloesters was explained on the basis
        of inductive effects in conjunction with other effects. The dielectric constant
        dependence of the rates was accounted for by an equation formerly proposed
