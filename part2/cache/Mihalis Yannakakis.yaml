        "We study the problem of finding a Tarski fixed point over the k -dimensional
        grid [ n ] k . We give a black-box reduction from the Tarski problem to the
        same problem with an additional promise that the input function has a unique
        fixed point. It implies that the Tarski problem and the unique Tarski problem
        have exactly the same query complexity. Our reduction is based on a novel
        notion of partial-information functions which we use to fool algorithms for
        the unique Tarski problem as if they were working on a monotone function with
        a unique fixed point", "venue": "Electron. Colloquium Comput. Complex.", "year":

        Networking (IBN) has been increasingly deployed in production enterprise networks.
        Automated network configuration in IBN lets operators focus on intents- i.e.,
        the end to end business objectives-rather than spelling out details of the
        configurations that implement these objectives. Automation brings its own
        concerns as the administrators cannot rely on traditional network troubleshooting
        tools. This situation is further exacerbated in the case of stateful Network
        Functions (NFs) whose packet processing behavior depends on previously observed
        traffic patterns. To ensure that the network configuration and state derived
        from network automation matches the administrator\u2019s specified intent,
        we propose, Epinoia, a network intent checker for stateful networks. Epinoia
        relies on a unified model for NFs by leveraging the causal precedence relationships
        that exist between NF packet I/Os and states. Scalability of Epinoia is achieved
        by decomposing intents into sub-checking tasks and maintaining a causality
        graph between checked invariants. Epinoia checks for network-wide intent violations
        incrementally to reduce overhead in the event of network changes. Our evaluation
        results using real-world network topologies show that Epinoia can perform
        comprehensive checking within a few seconds per network with intent updates.",

        management approach in Software-Defined Wide Area Networks (SD-WAN). Traditional
        WANs suffer from low utilization and lack of global view of the network. Therefore,
        during failures, topology/service/traffic changes, or new policy requirements,
        the system does not always converge to the global optimal state. Using Software
        Defined Networking architectures in WANs provides the opportunity to design
        WANs with higher fault tolerance, scalability, and manageability. We exploit
        the correlation matrix derived from monitoring system between the virtual
        links to infer the underlying route topology and propose a route update approach
        that minimizes the total route update cost on all flows. We formulate the
        problem as an integer linear programming optimization problem and provide
        a centralized control approach that minimizes the total cost while satisfying
        the quality of service (QoS) on all flows. Experimental results on real network

        gave a simple and general scheme for implementing a one-sided matching market
        using the power of a pricing mechanism. Their method has nice properties --
        it is incentive compatible in the large and produces an allocation that is
        Pareto optimal -- and hence it provides an attractive, off-the-shelf method
        for running an application involving such a market. With matching markets
        becoming ever more prevalant and impactful, it is imperative to finally settle
        the computational complexity of this scheme. We present the following partial
        resolution: 1. A combinatorial, strongly polynomial time algorithm for the
        special case of $0/1$ utilities. 2. An example that has only irrational equilibria,
        hence proving that this problem is not in PPAD. Furthermore, its equilibria
        are disconnected, hence showing that the problem does not admit a convex programming
        formulation. 3. A proof of membership of the problem in the class FIXP. We
        leave open the (difficult) question of determining if the problem is FIXP-hard.
        Settling the status of the special case when utilities are in the set $\\{0,

        "abstract": "The use of monotonicity and Tarski''s theorem in existence proofs
        of equilibria is very widespread in economics, while Tarski''s theorem is
        also often used for similar purposes in the context of verification. However,
        there has been relatively little in the way of analysis of the complexity
        of finding the fixed points and equilibria guaranteed by this result. We study
        a computational formalism based on monotone functions on the $d$-dimensional
        grid with sides of length $N$, and their fixed points, as well as the closely
        connected subject of supermodular games and their equilibria. It is known
        that finding some (any) fixed point of a monotone function can be done in
        time $\\log^d N$, and we show it requires at least $\\log^2 N$ function evaluations
        already on the 2-dimensional grid, even for randomized algorithms. We show
        that the general Tarski problem of finding some fixed point, when the monotone
        function is given succinctly (by a boolean circuit), is in the class PLS of
        problems solvable by local search and, rather surprisingly, also in the class
        PPAD. Finding the greatest or least fixed point guaranteed by Tarski''s theorem,
        however, requires $d\\cdot N$ steps, and is NP-hard in the white box model.
        For supermodular games, we show that finding an equilibrium in such games
        is essentially computationally equivalent to the Tarski problem, and finding
        the maximum or minimum equilibrium is similarly harder. Interestingly, two-player
        supermodular games where the strategy space of one player is one-dimensional
        can be solved in $O(\\log N)$ steps. We also observe that computing (approximating)
        the value of Condon''s (Shapley''s) stochastic games reduces to the Tarski
        problem. An important open problem highlighted by this work is proving a $\\Omega(\\log^d
        N)$ lower bound for small fixed dimension $d \\geq 3$.", "venue": "Information

        "abstract": "We study cyber attacks on power grids that affect both the physical
        infrastructure and the data at the control center? which therefore are cyber-physical
        in nature. In particular, we assume that an adversary attacks an area by:
        (i) remotely disconnecting some lines within the attacked area, and (ii) modifying
        the information received from the attacked area to mask the line failures
        and hide the attacked area from the control center. For the latter, we consider
        two types of attacks: (i) data distortion: which distorts the data by adding
        powerful noise to the actual data, and (ii) data replay: which replays a locally
        consistent old data instead of the actual data. We use the DC power flow model
        and prove that the problem of finding the set of line failures given the phase
        angles of the nodes outside of the attacked area is strongly NP-hard, even

        "abstract": "Network operators today deploy a wide range of complex, stateful
        network functions (NFs). Typically, they only have access to the NFs\u2019
        binary executables, configuration interfaces, and manuals from vendors. To
        ensure correct behavior of NFs, operators use network testing and verification
        tools, which often rely on models of the deployed NFs. The effectiveness of
        these tools depends on the fidelity of such models. Today, models are handwritten,
        which can be error prone, tedious, and does not account for implementation-specific
        artifacts. To address this gap, our goal is to automatically infer behavioral
        models of stateful NFs for a given configuration. The problem is challenging
        because NF configurations can contain diverse rule types and the space of
        dynamic and stateful NF behaviors is large. In this work, we present Alembic,
        which synthesizes NF models viewed as an ensemble of finite-state machines
        (FSMs). Alembic consists of an offline stage that learns symbolic FSM representations
        for each NF rule type and an online stage that generates a concrete behavioral
        model for a given configuration using these symbolic FSMs. We demonstrate
        that Alembic is accurate, scalable, and sheds light on subtle differences
        across NF implementations.", "venue": "Symposium on Networked Systems Design

        Talk)", "abstract": "Many problems from a wide variety of areas can be formulated
        mathematically as the problem of computing a fixed point of a suitable given
        multivariate function. Examples include a variety of problems from game theory,
        economics, optimization, stochastic analysis, verification, and others. In
        some problems there is a unique fixed point (for example if the function is
        a contraction); in others there may be multiple fixed points and any one of
        them is an acceptable solution; while in other cases the desired object is
        a specific fixed point (for example the least fixed point or greatest fixed
        point of a monotone function). In this talk we will discuss several types
        of fixed point computation problems, their complexity, and some of the common
        themes that have emerged: classes of problems for which there are efficient
        algorithms, and other classes for which there seem to be serious obstacles.

        of passive grasp stability under an external disturbance, that is, the ability
        of a grasp to resist a disturbance through passive responses at the contacts.
        To obtain physically consistent results, such a model must account for friction
        phenomena at each contact; the difficulty is that friction forces depend in
        non-linear fashion on contact behavior (stick or slip). We develop the first
        polynomial-time algorithm which either solves such complex equilibrium constraints
        for two-dimensional grasps, or otherwise concludes that no solution exists.
        To achieve this, we show that the number of possible `slip states'' (where
        each contact is labeled as either sticking or slipping) that must be considered
        is polynomial (in fact quadratic) in the number of contacts, and not exponential
        as previously thought. Our algorithm captures passive response behaviors at
        each contact, while accounting for constraints on friction forces such as
        the maximum dissipation principle.", "venue": "Robotics: Science and Systems",

        from linear algebra and graph theory and leverage the properties of the linearized
        power flow model to develop methods for information recovery. Using information
        observed outside the attacked zone, these methods recover information about
        the disconnected lines and the phase angles at the buses. We identify sufficient
        conditions on the zone structure and constraints on the attack characteristics  such
        that these methods can recover the information. We also show that it is NP-hard
        to find an approximate solution to the problem of partitioning the power grid
        into the minimum number of attack-resilient zones. However, since power grids

        Mechanism Design problem for a single additive buyer is #P-hard, even when
        the distributions have support size 2 for each item and, more importantly,
        even when the optimal solution is guaranteed to be of a very simple kind:
        the seller picks a price for each individual item and a price for the grand
        bundle of all the items; the buyer can purchase either the grand bundle at
        its given price or any subset of items at their total individual prices. The
        following problems are also #P-hard, as immediate corollaries of the proof:
        \n1. determining if individual item pricing is optimal for a given instance,
        \n2. determining if grand bundle pricing is optimal, and \n3. computing the
        optimal (deterministic) revenue. \nOn the positive side, we show that when
        the distributions are i.i.d. with support size 2, the optimal revenue obtainable
        by any mechanism, even a randomized one, can be achieved by a simple solution
        of the above kind (individual item pricing with a discounted price for the
        grand bundle) and furthermore, it can be computed in polynomial time. The
        problem can be solved in polynomial time too when the number of items is constant.",

        some lines within the attacked area, and (ii) modifying the information received
        from the attacked area to mask the line failures and hide the attacked area
        from the control center. For the latter, we consider two types of attacks:
        (i) data distortion: which distorts the data by adding powerful noise to the
        actual data, and (ii) data replay: which replays a locally consistent old
        data instead of the actual data. We use the DC power flow model and prove
        that the problem of finding the set of line failures given the phase angles
        of the nodes outside of the attacked area is strongly NP-hard, even when the

        "We present algorithms for the qualitative and quantitative model checking
        of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) properties for Recursive Markov Chains (RMCs).
        Recursive Markov Chains are a natural abstract model of procedural probabilistic
        programs and related systems involving recursion and probability. For the
        qualitative problem (\u201cGiven a RMC and an LTL formula , do the computations
        of satisfy almost surely?\u201d) we present an algorithm that runs in polynomial
        space in and exponential time in . For several classes of RMCs, including
        RMCs with one exit (a special case that corresponds to well-studied probabilistic
        systems, e.g., multi-type branching processes and stochastic context-free
        grammars) the algorithm runs in polynomial time in and exponential time in
        . On the other hand, we also prove that the problem is EXPTIMEhard, and hence
        it is EXPTIME-complete. For the quantitative problem (\u201cdoes the probability
        that a computation of satisfies exceed a given threshold ?\u201d, or approximate
        the probability within a desired precision) we present an algorithm that runs
        in polynomial space in and exponential space in . For linearly-recursive RMCs,
        we can compute the exact probability in time polynomial in and exponential
        in . These results improve by one exponential, in both the qualitative and
        quantitative case, the complexity that one would obtain if one first translated
        the LTL formula to a B\u00fcchi automaton and then applied the model checking
        algorithm for B\u00fcchi automata from [11]. Our results combine techniques
        developed in [10, 11] for analysis of RMCs, and in [6] for LTL model checking

        and P-Time Model Checking of Probabilistic One-Counter Automata", "abstract":
        "A central computational problem for analyzing and model checking various
        classes of infinite-state recursive probabilistic systems (including quasi-birth-death
        processes, multitype branching processes, stochastic context-free grammars,
        probabilistic pushdown automata and recursive Markov chains) is the computation
        of termination probabilities, and computing these probabilities in turn boils
        down to computing the least fixed point (LFP) solution of a corresponding
        monotone polynomial system (MPS) of equations, denoted x=P(x). It was shown
        in Etessami and Yannakakis [2009] that a decomposed variant of Newton\u2019s
        method converges monotonically to the LFP solution for any MPS that has a
        nonnegative solution. Subsequently, Esparza et al. [2010] obtained upper bounds
        on the convergence rate of Newton\u2019s method for certain classes of MPSs.
        More recently, better upper bounds have been obtained for special classes
        of MPSs [Etessami et al. 2010, 2012]. However, prior to this article, for
        arbitrary (not necessarily strongly connected) MPSs, no upper bounds at all
        were known on the convergence rate of Newton\u2019s method as a function of
        the encoding size |P| of the input MPS, x=P(x). In this article, we provide
        worst-case upper bounds, as a function of both the input encoding size |P|,
        and \u03b5 > 0, on the number of iterations required for decomposed Newton\u2019s
        method (even with rounding) to converge to within additive error \u03b5 >
        0 of q*, for an arbitrary MPS with LFP solution q*. Our upper bounds are essentially
        optimal in terms of several important parameters of the problem. Using our
        upper bounds, and building on prior work, we obtain the first P-time algorithm
        (in the standard Turing model of computation) for quantitative model checking,
        to within arbitrary desired precision, of discrete-time QBDs and (equivalently)
        probabilistic 1-counter automata, with respect to any (fixed) \u03c9-regular
        or LTL property.", "venue": "Journal of the ACM", "year": 2013, "referenceCount":

        integer inputs. <i>Input instance:</i> Four lists of positive integers:\n

        "title": "Model Checking of Recursive Probabilistic Systems", "abstract":
        "Recursive Markov Chains (RMCs) are a natural abstract model of procedural
        probabilistic programs and related systems involving recursion and probability.
        They succinctly define a class of denumerable Markov chains that generalize
        several other stochastic models, and they are equivalent in a precise sense
        to probabilistic Pushdown Systems. In this article, we study the problem of
        model checking an RMC against an \u03c9-regular specification, given in terms
        of a B\u00fcchi automaton or a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. Namely,
        given an RMC A and a property, we wish to know the probability that an execution
        of A satisfies the property. We establish a number of strong upper bounds,
        as well as lower bounds, both for qualitative problems (is the probability
        =\u20091, or =\u20090?), and for quantitative problems (is the probability
        \u2265\u2009p?, or, approximate the probability to within a desired precision).
        The complexity upper bounds we obtain for automata and LTL properties are
        similar, although the algorithms are different.\n We present algorithms for
        the qualitative model checking problem that run in polynomial space in the
        size |A| of the RMC and exponential time in the size of the property (the
        automaton or the LTL formula). For several classes of RMCs, including single-exit
        RMCs (a class that encompasses some well-studied stochastic models, for instance,
        stochastic context-free grammars) the algorithm runs in polynomial time in
        |A|. For the quantitative model checking problem, we present algorithms that
        run in polynomial space in the RMC and exponential space in the property.
        For the class of linearly recursive RMCs we can compute the exact probability
        in time polynomial in the RMC and exponential in the property. For deterministic
        automata specifications, all our complexities in the specification come down
        by one exponential.\n For lower bounds, we show that the qualitative model
        checking problem, even for a fixed RMC, is already EXPTIME-complete. On the
        other hand, even for simple reachability analysis, we know from our prior
        work that our PSPACE upper bounds in A can not be improved substantially without
        a breakthrough on a well-known open problem in the complexity of numerical
        computation.", "venue": "TOCL", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 38, "citationCount":

        "title": "Temporal Synthesis for Bounded Systems and Environments", "abstract":
        "Temporal synthesis is the automated construction of a system from its temporal
        specification. It is by now realized that requiring the synthesized system
        to satisfy the specifications against all possible environments may be too
        demanding, and, dually, allowing all systems may be not demanding enough.
        In this work we study bounded temporal synthesis, in which bounds on the sizes
        of the state space of the system and the environment are additional parameters
        to the synthesis problem. This study is motivated by the fact that such bounds
        may indeed change the answer to the synthesis problem, as well as the theoretical
        and computational aspects of the synthesis problem. In particular, a finer
        analysis of synthesis, which takes system and environment sizes into account,
        yields deeper insight into the quantificational structure of the synthesis
        problem and the relationship between strong synthesis -- there exists a system
        such that for all environments, the specification holds, and weak synthesis
        -- for all environments there exists a system such that the specification
        holds. \n \nWe first show that unlike the unbounded setting, where determinacy
        of regular games implies that strong and weak synthesis coincide, these notions
        do not coincide in the bounded setting. We then turn to study the complexity
        of deciding strong and weak synthesis. We show that bounding the size of the
        system or both the system and the environment, turns the synthesis problem
        into a search problem, and one cannot expect to do better than brute-force
        search. In particular, the synthesis problem for bounded systems and environment
        is Sigma^P_2-complete (in terms of the bounds, for a specification given by
        a deterministic automaton). We also show that while bounding the environment
        may lead to the synthesis of specifications that are otherwise unrealizable,
        such relaxation of the problem comes at a high price from a complexity-theoretic
        point of view.", "venue": "Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science",

        Abstract)", "abstract": "We reexamine, what it means to compute Nash equilibria
        and, more, generally, what it means to compute a fixed point of a given Brouwer
        function, and we investigate the complexity of the associated problems. Specifically,
        we study the complexity of the following problem: given a finite game, Gamma,
        with 3 or more players, and given epsiv > 0, compute a vector x'' (a mixed
        strategy profile) that is within distance e (say in t^) of some (exact) Nash
        equilibrium. We show that approximation of an (actual) Nash equilibrium for
        games with 3 players, even to within any non-trivial constant additive factor
        epsiv < 1/2 in just one desired coordinate, is at least as hard as the long
        standing square-root sum problem, as well as more general arithmetic circuit
        decision problems, and thus that even placing the approximation problem in
        NP would-resolve a major open problem in the complexity of numerical computation.
        Furthermore, we show that the (exact or approximate) computation of Nash equilibria
        for 3 or more players is complete for the class of search problems, which
        we call FIXP, that can be cast as fixed point computation problems for functions
        represented by algebraic circuits (straight line programs) over basis {+,
        *, -, /, max, min}, with rational constants. We show that the linear fragment
        of FIXP equals PPAD. Many problems in game theory, economics, and probability
        theory, can be cast as fixed point problems for such algebraic functions.
        We discuss several important such problems: computing the value of Shapley''s
        stochastic games, and the simpler games of Condon, extinction probabilities
        of branching processes, termination probabilities of stochastic context-free
        grammars, and of Recursive Markov Chains. We show that for some of them, the
        approximation, or even exact computation, problem can be placed-in PPAD, while
        for others, they are at least as hard as the square-root sum and arithmetic
        circuit decision problems.", "venue": "IEEE Annual Symposium on Foundations

        "title": "Buy-at-bulk-related problems in network design", "abstract": "We
        study a number of graph-theoretic optimization problems arising in network
        design. In general, the objective is to determine a network with minimum total
        cost that can support given traffic demands, possibly subject to additional
        constraints. Due to economies of scale, the cost of network components is
        typically sub-additive as a function of the capacity they provide, so these
        problems have a so-called buy-at-bulk character. Network dimensioning, which
        represents a high-level phase within the long process of telecommunications
        network planning, is a primary motivation for this work. We remark that although
        buy-at-bulk network design has received a lot of attention from researchers
        in theoretical computer science for more than a decade, these efforts were
        concentrated on investigating a rather simple version of the problem with
        minimal constraints, under a broad range of cost models that fall within the
        buy-at-bulk framework. By contrast, herein we initiate the study of several
        more involved problem variants, inspired by real-life situations. \nFirst,
        we analyze directed buy-at-bulk network design, which includes cases where
        network links allow only one-way traffic, or more generally where the cost
        of installing capacity on a link is asymmetric with respect to the direction
        of the traffic. We furthermore consider buy-at-bulk network design with protection,
        in which we are required to ensure robustness against the failure of any single
        component, by allocating capacity for each traffic demand along two disjoint
        routes in the network. Finally, we also investigate the traffic grooming problem,
        which arises when demands requesting small amounts of bandwidth must be accommodated
        in an optical network offering high-capacity transmission channels. \nOur
        main contributions are approximation algorithms with non-trivial worst-case
        guarantees for each of the above problems; moreover, from the experimental
        perspective, we present efficient heuristics that perform very well on realistic
        problem instances.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        "Many models from a variety of areas involve the computation of an equilibrium

        "title": "Finite S", "abstract": "With advanced computer technology, systems
        are getting larger to fulfill more complicated tasks: however, they are also
        becoming less reliable. Consequently, testing is an indispensable part of
        system design and implementation; yet it has proved to be a formidable task
        for complex systems. This motivates the study of testing jinite state machines
        to ensure the correct functioning of systems and to discover aspects of their
        behavior. A Jinite state machine contains a jinite number of states and produces
        outputs on state transitions after receiving inputs. Finite state machines
        are widely used to model systems in diverse areas, including sequential circuits,
        certain types of programs, and, more recently, communication protocols. In
        a testing problem we have a machine about which we lack some information;
        we would like to deduce this information by providing a sequence of inputs
        to the machine and observing the outputs produced. Because of its practical
        importance and theoretical interest, the problem of testing finite state machines
        has been studied in different areas and at various times. The earliest published
        literature on this topic dates back to the 1950\u2019s. Activities in the
        1960\u2019s and early 1970\u2019s were motivated mainly by automata theory
        and sequential circuit testing. The area seemed to have mostly died down until
        a few years ago when the testing problem was resurrected and is now being
        studied anew due to its applications to conformance testing of communication
        protocols. While some old problems which had been open for decades were resolved
        recently, new concepts and more intriguing problems from new applications
        to ensure their correct functioning and to discover aspects of their behavior.
        There are two types of finite state machines: Mealy machines and Moore machines.
        The theory is very similar for the two types. We consider Mealy machines here
        because they model finite state systems more properly and are more general
        than Moore machines. A Mealy machine has a finite number of states and produces
        outputs on state transitions after receiving inputs. We discuss the following
        two types of testing problems. In the first type of problems, we have the
        transition diagram of a finite state machine but we do not know in which state
        it is. We apply an input sequence to the machine so that from its inputloutput
        (UO) behavior we can deduce desired information about its state. Specifically,
        in the state identification problem we wish to identify the initial state
        of the machine; a test sequence that solves this problem is called a distinguishing
        sequence. In the state verification problem we wish to verify that the machine
        is in a specified state; a test sequence that solves this problem is called
        a unique input/output (UIO) sequence. A different type of problem is conformance
        testing. Given a specification finite state machine, for which we have its
        transition diagram, and an imp1ementation, Or box\u201d for which we can only
        observe its behavior, we want to test whether the implementation conforms
        to the specification. This is called the conformance testing or fault detection
        problem and a test sequence that solves this problem is called a checking
        sequence. Testing hardware and software contains very wide fields with an
        extensive literature which we cannot hope to cover. Here we will focus on
        the basic problems of testing finite state machines and present the general
        principles and methods. We shall not discuss testing combinational circuits
        which are essentially not finite state systems [50], [75], [l]. We shall not
        consider functional testing either where we want to verify the equivalence
        of two known machines or circuits which are not \u201cblack boxes\u201d [l],
        [34], [69]. Numerical software testing is outside the scope of this article
        where there is an infinite number (in most cases emerge. We review the fundamental
        problems in testing jinite state machines and techniques for solving these
        problems, tracing progress in the area from its inception to the present and
        the state of the art. In addition, we discuss extensions offinite state machines
        and some other topics related to testing.", "venue": "", "year": 2009, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Quasi-Birth-Death Processes, Tree-Like QBDs, Probabilistic 1-Counter
        Automata, and Pushdown Systems", "abstract": "We begin by observing that (discrete-time)
        Quasi-Birth-Death Processes (QBDs) are equivalent, in a precise sense, to
        (discrete-time) probabilistic 1-Counter Automata (p1CAs), and both Tree-Like
        QBDs (TL-QBDs) and Tree-Structured QBDs (TS-QBDs) are equivalent to both probabilistic
        Pushdown Systems (pPDSs) and Recursive Markov Chains (RMCs). We then proceed
        to exploit these connections to obtain a number of new algorithmic upper and
        lower bounds for central computational problems about these models. Our main
        result is this: for an arbitrary QBD (even a null-recurrent one), we can approximate
        its termination probabilities (i.e., its G matrix) to within i bits of precision
        (i.e., within additive error 1/2i), in time polynomial in both the encoding
        size of the QBD and in i, in the unit-cost rational arithmetic RAM model of
        computation. Specifically, we show that a decomposed Newton''s method can
        be used to achieve this. We emphasize that this bound is very different from
        the well-known \"linear/quadratic convergence\" of numerical analysis, known
        for QBDs and TL-QBDs, which typically gives no constructive bound in terms
        of the encoding size of the system being solved. In fact, we observe (based
        on recent results for pPDSs) that for the more general TL-QBDs this bound
        fails badly. Specifically, in the worst case Newton''s method \"converges
        linearly\" to the termination probabilities for TL-QBDs, but requires exponentially
        many iterations in the encoding size of the TL-QBD to approximate these probabilities
        within any non-trivial constant error c < 1. Our upper bound proof for QBDs
        combines several ingredients: a detailed analysis of the structure of 1-counter
        automata, an iterative application of a classic condition number bound for
        errors in linear systems,and a very recent constructive bound on the performance
        of Newton''s method for monotone systems of polynomial equations.", "venue":

        the succinct approximation of convex Pareto curves of multiobjective optimization

        the appropriate one for the convex setting, and observe that it can offer
        arbitrarily more compact representations than \u03b5-Pareto sets in this context.
        We characterize when an \u03b5-CP can be constructed in polynomial time in
        terms of an efficient routine Comb for optimizing (exactly or approximately)
        monotone linear combinations of the objectives. We investigate the problem

        and continuous (convex) problems, and present general algorithms using a Comb
        routine. For bi-objective problems, we show that if we have an exact Comb
        optimization routine, then we can compute the minimum \u03b5-CP for continuous
        problems (this applies for example to bi-objective Linear Programming and

        Abstract)", "abstract": "We reexamine, what it means to compute Nash equilibria
        and, more, generally, what it means to compute a fixed point of a given Brouwer
        function, and we investigate the complexity of the associated problems. Specifically,
        we study the complexity of the following problem: given a finite game, Gamma,
        with 3 or more players, and given epsiv > 0, compute a vector x'' (a mixed
        strategy profile) that is within distance e (say in t^) of some (exact) Nash
        equilibrium. We show that approximation of an (actual) Nash equilibrium for
        games with 3 players, even to within any non-trivial constant additive factor
        epsiv < 1/2 in just one desired coordinate, is at least as hard as the long
        standing square-root sum problem, as well as more general arithmetic circuit
        decision problems, and thus that even placing the approximation problem in
        NP would-resolve a major open problem in the complexity of numerical computation.
        Furthermore, we show that the (exact or approximate) computation of Nash equilibria
        for 3 or more players is complete for the class of search problems, which
        we call FIXP, that can be cast as fixed point computation problems for functions
        represented by algebraic circuits (straight line programs) over basis {+,
        *, -, /, max, min}, with rational constants. We show that the linear fragment
        of FIXP equals PPAD. Many problems in game theory, economics, and probability
        theory, can be cast as fixed point problems for such algebraic functions.
        We discuss several important such problems: computing the value of Shapley''s

        of single-exit RCSGs (1-RCSGs). We first characterize the value of a 1-RCSG
        termination game as the least fixed point solution of a system of nonlinear

        quantitative termination problem. We then give a strategy improvement technique,

        "title": "Recursive Markov chains, stochastic grammars, and monotone systems
        of nonlinear equations", "abstract": "We define Recursive Markov Chains (RMCs),
        a class of finitely presented denumerable Markov chains, and we study algorithms
        for their analysis. Informally, an RMC consists of a collection of finite-state
        Markov chains with the ability to invoke each other in a potentially recursive
        manner. RMCs offer a natural abstract model for probabilistic programs with
        procedures. They generalize, in a precise sense, a number of well-studied
        stochastic models, including Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFG) and Multi-Type
        Branching Processes (MT-BP).\n We focus on algorithms for reachability and
        termination analysis for RMCs: what is the probability that an RMC started
        from a given state reaches another target state, or that it terminates? These
        probabilities are in general irrational, and they arise as (least) fixed point
        solutions to certain (monotone) systems of nonlinear equations associated
        with RMCs. We address both the qualitative problem of determining whether
        the probabilities are 0, 1 or in-between, and the quantitative problems of
        comparing the probabilities with a given bound, or approximating them to desired
        precision.\n We show that all these problems can be solved in PSPACE using
        a decision procedure for the Existential Theory of Reals. We provide a more
        practical algorithm, based on a decomposed version of multi-variate Newton''s
        method, and prove that it always converges monotonically to the desired probabilities.
        We show this method applies more generally to any monotone polynomial system.
        We obtain polynomial-time algorithms for various special subclasses of RMCs.
        Among these: for SCFGs and MT-BPs (equivalently, for 1-exit RMCs) the qualitative
        problem can be solved in P-time; for linearly recursive RMCs the probabilities
        are rational and can be computed exactly in P-time.\n We show that our PSPACE
        upper bounds cannot be substantially improved without a breakthrough on long
        standing open problems: the square-root sum problem and an arithmetic circuit
        decision problem that captures P-time on the unit-cost rational arithmetic
        RAM model. We show that these problems reduce to the qualitative problem and
        to the approximation problem (to within any nontrivial error) for termination
        probabilities of general RMCs, and to the quantitative decision problem for
        termination (extinction) of SCFGs (MT-BPs).", "venue": "JACM", "year": 2005,

        "abstract": "We introduce Recursive Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) and
        Recursive Simple Stochastic Games (RSSGs), which are classes of (finitely
        presented) countable-state MDPs and zero-sum turn-based (perfect information)
        stochastic games. They extend standard finite-state MDPs and stochastic games
        with a recursion feature. We study the decidability and computational complexity
        of these games under termination objectives for the two players: one player''s
        goal is to maximize the probability of termination at a given exit, while
        the other player''s goal is to minimize this probability. In the quantitative
        termination problems, given an RMDP (or RSSG) and probability p, we wish to
        decide whether the value of such a termination game is at least p (or at most
        p); in the qualitative termination problem we wish to decide whether the value
        is 1. The important 1-exit subclasses of these models, 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs,
        correspond in a precise sense to controlled and game versions of classic stochastic
        models, including multitype Branching Processes and Stochastic Context-Free
        Grammars, where the objective of the players is to maximize or minimize the
        probability of termination (extinction). We provide a number of upper and
        lower bounds for qualitative and quantitative termination problems for RMDPs
        and RSSGs. We show both problems are undecidable for multi-exit RMDPs, but
        are decidable for 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs. Specifically, the quantitative termination
        problem is decidable in PSPACE for both 1-RMDPs and 1-RSSGs, and is at least
        as hard as the square root sum problem, a well-known open problem in numerical
        computation. We show that the qualitative termination problem for 1-RMDPs
        (i.e., a controlled version of branching processes) can be solved in polynomial
        time both for maximizing and minimizing 1-RMDPs. The qualitative problem for
        1-RSSGs is in NP \u2229 coNP, and is at least as hard as the quantitative
        termination problem for Condon''s finite-state simple stochastic games, whose
        complexity remains a well known open problem. Finally, we show that even for
        1-RMDPs, more general (qualitative and quantitative) model-checking problems
        with respect to linear-time temporal properties are undecidable even for a
        fixed property.", "venue": "International Colloquium on Automata, Languages

        "We present algorithms for the qualitative and quantitative model checking
        of linear temporal logic (LTL) properties for recursive Markov chains (RMCs).
        Recursive Markov chains are a natural abstract model of procedural probabilistic
        programs and related systems involving recursion and probability. For the
        qualitative problem (\"given a RMC A and an LTL formula /spl phi/, do the
        computations of A satisfy /spl phi/ almost surely?) we present an algorithm
        that runs in polynomial space in A and exponential time in /spl phi/. For
        several classes of RMCs, including RMCs with one exit (a special case that
        corresponds to well-studied probabilistic systems, e.g., multi-type branching
        processes and stochastic context-free grammars) the algorithm runs in polynomial
        time in A and exponential time in /spl phi/. On the other hand, we also prove
        that the problem is EXPTIME-hard, and hence it is EXPTlME-complete. For the
        quantitative problem (\"does the probability that a computation of A satisfies
        /spl phi/ exceed a given threshold p?\", or approximate the probability within
        a desired precision) we present an algorithm that runs in polynomial space
        in A and exponential space in /spl phi/. For linearly-recursive RMCs, we can
        compute the exact probability in time polynomial in A and exponential in /spl
        phi/. These results improve by one exponential, in both the qualitative and
        quantitative case, the complexity that one would obtain if one first translated
        the LTL formula to a Buchi automaton and then applied the model checking algorithm
        for Buchi automata from K. Etessami and M. Yannakakis (2005). Our results

        have suggested the idea of black box checking, where verification starts without
        any model, and the model is obtained while repeated verification attempts
        are performed. Under the current assumptions, an existing inaccurate (but

        from black box testing and machine learning. We present an implementation

        "Finite state machines have been used to model a wide variety of systems,
        including sequential circuits, communication protocols, and other types of
        reactive systems, i.e., systems that interact with their environment. In testing
        problems we are given a system, which we may test by providing inputs and
        observing the outputs produced. The goal is to design test sequences so that
        we can deduce desired information about the given system under test, such
        as whether it implements correctly a given specification machine (conformance
        testing), or whether it satisfies given requirement properties (black-box
        checking). In this talk we will review some of the theory and algorithms on
        basic testing problems for systems modeled by different types of finite state
        machines. Conformance testing of deterministic machines has been investigated
        for a long time; we will discuss various efficient methods. Testing of nondeterministic
        and probabilistic machines is related to games with incomplete information
        and to partially observable Markov decisions processes. The verification of
        properties for finite state systems with a known structure (i.e., \u201dwhite
        box\u201d checking) is known as the model-checking problem, and has been thoroughly
        studied for many years, yielding a rich theory, algorithms and tools. Black-box
        checking, i.e., the verification of properties for systems with an unknown
        structure, combines elements from model checking, conformance testing and
        learning.", "venue": "", "year": 2002, "referenceCount": 0, "citationCount":

        machines (RSMs) enhance the power of ordinary state machines by allowing vertices
        to correspond either to ordinary states or to potentially recursive invocations
        of other state machines. RSMs can model the control flow in sequential imperative
        programs containing recursive procedure calls. They can be viewed as a visual
        notation extending Statecharts-like hierarchical state machines, where concurrency
        is disallowed but recursion is allowed. They are also related to various models
        of pushdown systems studied in the verification and program analysis communities.After
        introducing RSMs and comparing their expressiveness with other models, we
        focus on whether verification can be efficiently performed for RSMs. Our first
        goal is to examine the verification of linear time properties of RSMs. We
        begin this study by dealing with two key components for algorithmic analysis
        and model checking, namely, reachability (Is a target state reachable from
        initial states?) and cycle detection (Is there a reachable cycle containing
        an accepting state?). We show that both these problems can be solved in time
        O(n\u03b82) and space O(n\u03b8), where n is the size of the recursive machine
        and \u03b8 is the maximum, over all component state machines, of the minimum
        of the number of entries and the number of exits of each component. From this,
        we easily derive algorithms for linear time temporal logic model checking
        with the same complexity in the model. We then turn to properties in the branching
        time logic CTL*, and again demonstrate a bound linear in the size of the state
        machine, but only for the case of RSMs with a single exit node.", "venue":

        speciications such as message sequence charts (MSC) ooer an intuitive and
        visual way of describing design requirements. MSC-graphs allow convenient
        expression of multiple scenarios, and can be viewed as an early model of the
        system that can be subjected to a variety of analyses. Problems such as LTL
        model checking are known to be decidable for the class of bounded MSC-graphs.
        Our rst set of results concerns checking realizability of bounded MSC-graphs.
        An MSC-graph is realizable if there is a distributed implementation that generates
        precisely the behaviors in the graph. There are two notions of realizability,
        weak and safe, depending on whether or not we require the implementation to
        be deadlock-free. It is known that for a set of MSCs, weak realizability is
        coNP-complete while safe realizability has a polynomial-time solution. We
        establish that for bounded MSC-graphs, weak realizability is, surprisingly,
        undecidable, while safe is in Expspace. Our second set of results concerns
        veriication of MSC-graphs. While checking properties of a graph G, besides
        verifying all the scenarios in the set L(G) of MSCs speciied by G, it is desirable
        to verify all the scenarios in the set L w (G)|the closure of G, that contains
        the implied scenarios that any distributed implementation of G must include.
        For checking whether a given MSC M is a possible behavior, checking M 2 L(G)
        is NP-complete, but checking M 2 L w (G) has a quadratic solution. For temporal
        logic speciications, considering the closure makes the veriication problem
        harder: while checking LTL properties of L(G) is Pspace-complete and checking
        local properties has polynomial-time solutions, even for boolean combinations
        of local properties of L w (G), verifying acyclic graphs is coNP-complete
        and verifying bounded graphs is undecidable.", "venue": "", "year": 2001,

        "abstract": "We study problems in multiobjective optimization, in which solutions
        to a combinatorial optimization problem are evaluated with respect to several
        cost criteria, and we are interested in the trade-off between these objectives
        (the so-called Pareto curve). We point out that, under very general conditions,
        there is a polynomially succinct curve that /spl epsiv/-approximates the Pareto
        curve, for any /spl epsiv/>0. We give a necessary and sufficient condition
        under which this approximate Pareto curve can be constructed in time polynomial
        in the size of the instance and 1//spl epsiv/. In the case of multiple linear
        objectives, we distinguish between two cases: when the underlying feasible
        region is convex, then we show that approximating the multi-objective problem
        is equivalent to approximating the single-objective problem. If however the
        feasible region is discrete, then we point out that the question reduces to
        an old and recurrent one: how does the complexity of a combinatorial optimization
        problem change when its feasible region is intersected with a hyperplane with
        small coefficients; we report some interesting new findings in this domain.
        Finally, we apply these concepts and techniques to formulate and solve approximately
        a cost-time-quality trade-off for optimizing access to the World-Wide Web,
        in a model first studied by Etzioni et al. (1996) (which was actually the

        and the Average Case Behavior of Optimal Packings", "abstract": "We consider
        the one-dimensional bin packing problem with unit-capacity bins and item sizes
        chosen according to the discrete uniform distribution U{j,k}, $1 < j \\leq
        k,$ where each item size in {1/k,2/k,. . .,j/k} has probability 1/j of being
        chosen. Note that for fixed j,k as $m\\rightarrow\\infty$ the discrete distributions
        U{mj,mk} approach the continuous distribution U(0,j/k], where the item sizes
        are chosen uniformly from the interval (0,j/k]. We show that average-case
        behavior can differ substantially between the two types of distributions.
        In particular, for all j,k with j<k-1, there exist on-line algorithms that
        have constant expected wasted space under U{j,k}, whereas no on-line algorithm
        has even o(n1/2) expected waste under U(0,u] for any $0 < u \\leq 1$. Our
        U{j,k} result is an application of a general theorem of Courcoubetis and Weber
        [C. Courcoubetis and R. R. Weber, Probab. Engrg. Inform. Sci., 4 (1990), pp.
        447--460] that covers all discrete distributions. Under each such distribution,
        the optimal expected waste for a random list of n items must be either $\\Theta
        (n)$, $\\Theta (n^{1/2} )$, or O(1), depending on whether certain \"perfect\"
        packings exist. The perfect packing theorem needed for the U{j,k} distributions

        is a cornerstone of the paper.", "venue": "SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics",

        problem The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) has been widely studied. Given
        a graph with lengths on its edges, the problem is to find a tour of minimum
        length that visits every vertex once. One usually makes the assumption that
        the edge lengths satisfy the triangle inequality, in which case the problem
        is equivalent to requiring the tour to visit every vertex at least (instead
        of exactly) once. With the further assumption that the edge lengths are symmetric
        (in other words, the graph is undirected), it is well-known that the optimum
        can be approximated to within a factor of 3/2. Without the latter assumption,
        i.e., when the graph is directed, the best-known approximation is a factor
        of log n ,[l]. Unfortunately, this algorithm can be nearly logn off from the
        optimum even when the edge lengths are all 1, and the underlying graph is
        known to be Hamiltonian. Here we study a linear programming relaxation for
        the problem. Our main result is that one can find a fractional solution to
        the relaxation that is very sparse ( with < 3n edges). We also show that in
        the special case when the underlying graph is Hamiltonian with edge lengths
        1 and the (inand out-) degrees of every vertex are each at most 2, a solution
        to the relaxation can be rounded to an integral solution (a tour) whose length
        is at most twice the optimum. Note that even this special case of the problem
        is NP-hard! (and the previous algorithm is 0( $$&) off).", "venue": "ACM-SIAM

        "title": "Black Box Checking", "abstract": "Two main approaches are used for
        increasing the quality of systems: in model checking , one checks properties
        of a known design of a system; in testing, one usually checks whether a given
        implementation, whose internal structure is often unknown, conforms with an
        abstract design. We are interested in the combination of these techniques.
        Namely, we would like to be able to test whether an implementation with unknown
        structure satisfies some given properties. We propose and formalize this problem
        of black box checking and suggest several algorithms. Since the input to black
        box checking is not given initially, as is the case in the classical model
        of computation, but is learned through experiments, we propose a computational
        model based on games with incomplete information. We use this model to analyze
        the complexity of the problem. We also address the more practical question
        of finding an approach that can detect errors in the implementation before
        completing an exhaustive search.", "venue": "Formal Techniques for (Networked

        checking is emerging as a practical tool for detecting logical errors in early
        stages of system design. We investigate the model checking of sequential hierarchical
        (nested) systems, i.e., finite-state machines whose states themselves can
        be other machines. This nesting ability is common in various software design
        methodologies, and is available in several commercial modeling tools. The
        straightforward way to analyze a hierarchical machine is to flatten it (thus
        incurring an exponential blow up) and apply a model-checking tool on the resulting
        ordinary FSM. We show that this flattening can be avoided. We develop algorithms
        for verifying linear-time requirements whose complexity is polynomial in the
        size of the hierarchical machine. We also address the verification of branching
        time requirements and provide efficient algorithms and matching lower bounds.",

        "We revisit the issue of the complexity of database queries, in the light
        of the recent parametric refinement of complexity theory. We show that, if
        the query size (or the number of variables in the query) is considered as
        a parameter, then the relational calculus and its fragments (conjunctive queries,
        positive queries) are classified at appropriate levels of the so-called W
        hierarchy of Downey and Fellows. These results strongly suggest that the query
        size is inherently in the exponent of the data complexity of any query evaluation
        algorithm, with the implication becoming stronger as the expressibility of
        the query language increases. For recursive languages (fixpoint logic, Datalog)
        this is provably the case [14]. On the positive side, we show that this exponential
        dependence can be avoided for the extension of acyclic queries with # (but
        not <) inequalities.", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART Symposium on Principles

        "abstract": "There are many obstacles to be overcome before formal methods
        are accepted as an integral part of the industrial design process. Many papers
        have been written about the nature of these obstacles. It can be argued convincingly
        that some of the objections that have been raised are based on misconceptions,
        or mere myths, about formal methods, e.g., 2]. But beyond these phases of
        \\anger\" and \\denial,\" we m a y h a ve reached a point i n t h e d e v
        elopment of formal methods where we \\accept\" the blame and develop new methods
        that form a better match with existing practice. This paper reports on our
        attempts to do so. One of the objectives of the early fault detection tools
        described here and in 1, 4 ] is to ease the transition towards the adoption
        of more formal design techniques, by accepting that design choices that are
        made in the early phases of a design are tentative and deliberately incomplete.
        Demanding that they be rigorous and complete at that stage of the design would
        be counterproductive. We h a ve argued that this potential handicap can be
        turned into an advantage. Acknowledgements: The work on early fault detection

        "abstract": "With advanced computer technology, systems are getting larger
        to fulfill more complicated tasks: however, they are also becoming less reliable.
        Consequently, testing is an indispensable part of system design and implementation;
        yet it has proved to be a formidable task for complex systems. This motivates
        the study of testing finite stare machines to ensure the correct functioning
        of systems and to discover aspects of their behavior. A finite state machine
        contains a finite number of states and produces outputs on state transitions
        after receiving inputs. Finite state machines are widely used to model systems
        in diverse areas, including sequential circuits, certain types of programs,
        and, more recently, communication protocols. In a testing problem we have
        a machine about which we lack some information; we would like to deduce this
        information by providing a sequence of inputs to the machine and observing
        the outputs produced. Because of its practical importance and theoretical
        interest, the problem of testing finite state machines has been studied in
        different areas and at various times. The earliest published literature on
        this topic dates back to the 1950''s. Activities in the 1960''s mid early
        1970''s were motivated mainly by automata theory and sequential circuit testing.
        The area seemed to have mostly died down until a few years ago when the testing
        problem was resurrected and is now being studied anew due to its applications
        to conformance testing of communication protocols. While some old problems
        which had been open for decades were resolved recently, new concepts and more
        intriguing problems from new applications emerge. We review the fundamental
        problems in testing finite state machines and techniques for solving these
        problems, tracing progress in the area from its inception to the present and
        the stare of the art. In addition, we discuss extensions of finite state machines
        and some other topics related to testing.", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE",

        We present simple randomized algorithms for the fault detection problem: Given
        a specification in the form of a deterministic finite state machine A and
        an implementation machine B, determine whether B is equal to A. If A has n
        states and p inputs, then in randomized polynomial time we can construct with
        high probability a checking sequence of length O(pn4 log n), i.e., a sequence
        that detects all faulty machines with at most n states. Better bounds can
        be obtained in certain cases. The techniques generalize to partially specified

        systems address the need to store, retrieve, and manipulate large amounts
        of data in an organized fashion. The database held has grown tremendously
        in the last 25 years. It is reported that the database industry generated
        $7 billion in revenue in 1994 and is growing at a rate of 35% per year. Industrial
        and academic research have been instrumental to this growth. Theory has played
        an important role in defining the right abstractions and concepts, and providing
        a firm foundation for the field. In order to access effectively a large volume
        of data, one needs an abstract logical view of the data, which must be separate
        from the physical storage of data. The important first component of a database
        is therefore an abstract view of data (called the data model) and the accompanying
        specialized high-level language that is used to access the data. The second
        important component is the data structures that are used to store the data
        along with the algorithms to support the efficient translation from the logical
        to the physical world. The third important component is the mechanisms that
        allow the database to be accessed concurrently by many users, without violating
        its integrity. Theory has contributed to all three fronts, starting with what
        is undoubtedly the cornerstone of the area, the introduction and formal definition
        of the relational model by F.P. Codd (1970). It is a highly unusual compliment
        for theory when the major commercial products in the field have at their core
        a mathematically rigorous, formal model. Our primary aims in this paper will
        be to give a flavor of the types of problems that database theory addresses,
        and to review how research in the area has evolved over the years. At the
        end we will try to point to some topics that may be of interest to people
        in the FOCS community tempted to work in database theory.", "venue": "Proceedings

        problem facing a set of decision-makers who must select values for the variables
        of a linear program, when only parts of the matrix are available to each of
        them. The goal is to find a feasible solution that is as close to the true
        optimum as possible, When each decision-maker decides one variable and knows
        all constraints involving this variable, we show that the worst-case ratio
        is related tc,the maximum number of variables appearing in each constraint,
        and a simple \u201csafe\u201d heuristic is optimal. Since this problem involves
        constrained optimization, there is a novel criterion, besides the competitive
        ratio, comparing the performance of a heuristic with the best feasible distributed
        algorithm, perhaps specializing on the current inst ante; we show different
        bounds for this parameter. When the constraint structure (the zero-nonzero
        pattern of the matrix) is known in advance, and the variables are partitioned
        bet ween decision-makers, then the optimum ratio is a complicated parameter
        of the associated hypergraph, which we bound from above and below in terms
        of variants of clique and graph coloring; but several interesting special
        cases are characterized completely. 1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering,

        present an algorithm for verifying that a model M with timing constraints
        satisfies a given temporal property T. The model M is given as a parallel
        composition of ?-automata Pi, where each automaton Pi is constrained by bounds
        on delays. The property T is given as an ?-automaton as well, and the verification
        problem is posed as a language inclusion question L(M) ? L(T). In constructing
        the composition M of the constrained automata Pi, one needs to rule out the
        behaviors that are inconsistent with the delay bounds, and this step is (provably)
        computationally expensive. We propose an iterative solution which involves
        generating successive approximations Mj to M, with containment L(M) ? L(Mj)
        and monotone convergence L(Mj) ? L(M) within a bounded number of steps. As
        the succession progresses, the approximations Mj become more complex. At any
        step of the iteration one may get a proof or a counter-example to the original
        language inclusion question. The described algorithm is implemented into the
        verifier Cospan. We illustrate the benefits of our strategy through some examples.",

        emptiness of the automaton resulting from the product of the program and the
        property. This problem is usually solved by com- puting the strongly connected
        components of the graph representing the product automaton. Here, we present

        "Many algorithms for NP-hard optimization problems find solutions that are
        locally optimal, in the sense that the solutions cannot be improved by a polynomially
        computable perturbation. Very little is known about the complexity of finding
        locally optimal solutions, either by local search algorithms or using other
        indirect methods. Johnson, Papadimitriou, and Yannakakis [J. Comput. System
        Sci., 37 (1988), pp. 79\u2013100] studied this question by defining a complexity
        class PLS that captures local search problems. It was proved that finding
        a partition of a graph that is locally optimal into equal parts with respect
        to the acclaimed Kernighan-Lin algorithm is PLS-complete. It is shown here
        that several natural, simple local search problems are PLS-complete, and thus
        just as hard. Two examples are: finding a partition that cannot be improved
        by a single swap of two vertices, and finding a stable configuration for an
        undirected connectionist network.When edges or other objects are unweighted,

        consider the following problem: given a collection of strings s1,\u2026, sm,

        greedy procedure produces a superstring of length O(n) (in fact, 2n), yet
        the only previous nontrivial bound known for any polynomial-time algorithm
        is a recent O(n log n) result.We show that the greedy algorithm does in fact
        achieve a constant factor approximation, proving an upper bound of 4n. Furthermore,
        we present a simple modified version of the greedy algorithm that we show
        produces a superstring of length at most 3n. We also show the superstring
        problem to be MAXSNP-hard, which implies that a polynomial-time approximation
        scheme for this problem is unlikely.", "venue": "Symposium on the Theory of

        "There is a straightforward algorithm for computing the transitive closure
        of an n-node directed graph in O(log2 n) time on an EREW-PRAM, using n3/log
        n processors, or indeed with M(n)/ logn processors if one can do serial matrix
        multiplication in time M(n). Th is algorithm is within a log factor of optimal
        in work (processor-time product), for solving the all-pairs transitive-closure
        problem for dense graphs. However, this algorithm is far from optimal when
        either (a) the graph is sparse, or (b) we want to solve the single-source
        transitive closure problem. Ideally, we would like an AfC algorithm for transitive
        closure that took about e processors for the single-source problem on a graph
        with n nodes and e 2 n arcs, or about en processors for the all-pairs problem
        on the same graph. While we cannot offer an algorithm that good, we can offer
        algorithms_with the following performance. (1) For single-source, O(nc) time

        @no time and d(enlvc) processors, provided e 2 n2-2c. Each of these claims
        assumes 0 < E 5 l/2. Importantly, the algorithms are (only) high-probability
        algorithms; that is, if they find a path, then a path exists, but they may
        fail to find a path that exists with probability at most 2-ac, where Q is
        some positive constant, and c is a multiplier for the time taken by the algorithm.

        to restore correctness is not allowed). It turns out that the right definition
        is recursive, and surprisingly involved. We show that, in fact, testing a
        schedule for reliability is PSPACE-complete, and thus in some sense even harder
        than the ordinary NP-complete notions of correctness examined in the past.
        However, we also prove that all conflict serializable schedules are always
        reliable, and thus reliability should not be an extra complication for practical
        concurrency control systems. Finally, we examine two other notions of reliability,

        a primitive for controlling concurrency in database systems is examined. It
        is accepted that the concurrent execution (or schedule) of different transactions

        in which the transactions run one at a time. It is shown that locking cannot

        schedules that can be produced if locking is used to control concurrency is

        only the effect of the schedule on the database is taken into account. In
        the second one, view serializability, the view of the data received by the

        "title": "Querying weak instances", "abstract": "1. INTRODUCTION The universal
        relation model gives the user a view of the data as though it was stored in
        a single relation, in which every attribute plays a unique role. Thus, in
        posing queries, the user does not have to navigate among the different base
        relations; the system performs this navigation automatically by transforming
        the query on the universal relation into one involving the stored base relations.
        For example, in a films database with relations FP (Film-Producer) and FD
        (Film-Diiwtor), ln response to the query rcrrieve P where D-FelJmi (which
        producers has Fellmi worked for), the system would \" know \" that diiectors
        are related to produc-ers'' through films. Thus, the relation between producers
        and directors would be constructed by taking the join of relations FP and
        FD and projecting on the attributes P, D. The fust approach towards defmlng
        the relationship between the actual database (the base relations) and the
        universal relation is known as the pure universal instance assumption. This
        assumption postulates that the database is formed by projecting some universal
        relation (satisfying the dependencies), and the universal relation is formed
        by taking the join of all the base relations. This assumption places very
        severe restrictions on the database, since incomplete information is not allowed-each
        tuple of a base relation must match with tuples in all the other relations.
        One could allow dao-glmg tuples (tuples that don''t match), but then in taking
        the joii of all the relations these tuples would get lost. For example, suppose
        that in the films database we have also a relation FA (Film-Actor). Then,
        if we take the join of all three relations FP, FD, FA , we loose the relationship
        between directors of documentaries and their", "venue": "ACM SIGACT-SIGMOD-SIGART

        usual method for preserving the consistency of a database when accessed (read
        and updated) concurrently by several transactions, is by locking the transactions
        according to some locking policy; a locking policy that guarantees the preservation
        of consistency of the database is called safe. Furthermore, if no deadlocks
        can arise the policy is called deadlock-free. In this paper we are concerned
        with the freedom from deadlock of safe locking policies. We show that a simple
        extension of the DAG policy of [Y] is the most general safe and deadlock-free
        policy for a pair of transactions. We prove however, that it is NP-complete
        to test whether a set of transactions is not deadlock-free even for the simplest
        kind of transactions, those that are two-phase locked [E]. We show that for
        the natural class of safe locking policies, the L-policies, studied in [Y],
        freedom from deadlock is determined only by the order in which entities are
        accessed by the transactions and not by the way in which safety is ensured.

        shown to be NP-complete for a large class of properties (the class of properties
        that are hereditary on induced subgraphs) using a small number of reduction
        schemes from the node cover problem. Since the node cover problem becomes
        polynomial on bipartite graphs, it might be hoped that this is the case with
        other node-deletion problems too.In this paper we characterize those properties
        for which the bipartite restriction of the node-deletion problem is polynomial
        and those for which it remains NP-complete. Similar results follow for analogous
        problems on other structures such as families of sets, hypergraphs and 0,1

        inherent reason why existing systems enforce D-serializability (rather than
        just because of its simplicity): it is because they are based on locking.
        Our main result is a characterization of the power of locking which states
        that if a locking policy is safe then it must allow only D-serializable schedules.
        Furthermore any such schedule can be produced by some safe locking policy.\n
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we formalize our
        concepts and describe the model. In Section 3 we characterize D-serializability
        in semantic terms. In Section 4 we examine when a set of transactions can
        be let to run safely by themselves without locking or any intervention from
        the scheduler. Section 5 is concerned with locking policies and in Section
        6 we discuss some implications of our results.", "venue": "Symposium on the

        [Codd 1970, Ullman 1979] has gained recognition as a valuable formal framework
        for understanding the semantics, design, and even implementation, of databases.
        At the heart of the research on relational databases lies the notion of data
        dependency. Data dependencies are domain-independent (Le., invariant under
        consistent renamings of domain elements) predicates on databases. Starting
        ,vith functional [Armstrong 1974] and muttivalued [Fagin 1977] dependencies,
        a dozen of different kinds of data dependencies have been proposed in the
        literature [Nicolas 1978, Paradaens 1979, Sagiv and Walecka 1979, and others].
        New, more and more general, kinds of data dependencies have been put forward
        in a rather arbitrary and heuristic fashion. This reflected two major frustrations
        of the research in this area: First, no natural, stable closure of this process
        was in sight. Secondly, the elegant complete axiomatizations of functional
        [Armstrong 1974] and multivalued dependencies [Beeri et ale 1977] did not
        appear to carry over to the more general kinds; thus the further generalizations
        were futile attempts at \"enriching the language\" enough so as to obtain
        a complete axiomatization.", "venue": "21st Annual Symposium on Foundations

        message sequence charts are sensitive t o v arious semantic interpretations.
        Under diierent semantics, diierent race conditions may occur. We h a ve proposed
        and implemented a tool which can be used to analyze message sequence charts
        to locate and visualize design errors as early as possible in a design cycle.
        The tool conforms to ITU recommendation Z.120. We h a ve noted that extensions
        of the tool, to gently integrate formal veriication techniques further into
        the design process, are possible. It is our intention to use the formal representation
        of MSCs described here as a v ehicle for exploring such extensions. Acknowledgements:
        We t h a n k C h uck Kalmanek, Bob Kurshan, and Mi-halis Yannakakis for many
        fruitful discussions. We are also grateful to Brian Kernighan, who developed
        a port of the MSC analyzer for Windows PCs. by successive a p p r o ximation.
        The tool allows the user to construct, edit, and analyze MSCs interactively.
        The charts may be stored in the ITU standard form (Z.120), in textual form
        as conventional annotated scenarios, or in graphical form, as PostScript les.
        Annotations to the MSC can be entered in comment boxes that become part of
        the scenario as displayed. For the online analysis of interpreted MSCs, the
        tool supports the four pre-deened semantics choices listed in Figure 4 through
        menu choices. Other user-deened semantics can easily be incorporated. The
        analysis for race conditions is invoked by clicking on a button labeled`Check..''.
        A menu is then created listing all connicts that can occur for the chosen
        semantic interpretation of the chart. By selecting a connict from a menu-list,
        the corresponding event pair is highlighted in the chart. The user can also
        set preferences so that only certain types of connicts (eg. between two receives,
        or between a send and a receive) are entered into the connict menus. The user
        can also select an event e, with a mouse click, and ask the tool to identify
        all related (or optionally all unrelated) events. Related are all those events
        that necessarily precede or follow e in the partial order. T h e t wo t ypes
        of events (i.e., following or preceding the selected event) are marked in
        diierent colors. For timing analysis, the user can annotate the chart with
        intervals, both on message transmissions and on local process states (see

        "abstract": "We study the succinct approximation of convex Pareto curves of
        multiobjective optimization problems. We propose the concept of -convex Pareto
        ( -CP) set as the appropriate one for the convex setting, and observe that
        it can offer arbitrarily more compact representations than -Pareto sets in
        this context. We characterize when an -CP can be constructed in polynomial
        time in terms of an efficient routine Comb for optimizing (exactly or approximately)
        monotone linear combinations of the objectives. We investigate the problem
        of computing minimum size -convex Pareto sets, both for discrete (combinatorial)
        and continuous (convex) problems, and present general algorithms using a Comb
        routine. For bi-objective problems, we show that if we have an exact Comb
        optimization routine, then we can compute the minimum -CP for continuous problems
        (this applies for example to bi-objective Linear Programming and Markov Decision
        Processes), and factor 2 approximation to the minimum -CP for discrete problems
        (this applies for example to bi-objective versions of polynomial-time solvable
        combinatorial problems such as Shortest Paths, Spanning Tree, etc.). If we
        have an approximate Comb routine, then we can compute factor 3 and 6 approximations
        respectively to the minimum -CP for continuous and discrete bi-objective problems.
        We consider also the case of three and more objectives and present some upper
        and lower bounds.", "venue": "", "year": null, "referenceCount": 29, "citationCount":
