        pharmacist immunization privileges influence pharmacist intervention effectiveness
        in delivering pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccinations and assess the implications
        these privileges have on vaccination rates.\n\n\nSTUDY DESIGN\nCross-sectional
        study of Walgreens vaccination records from August 2011 to March 2012.\n\n\nMETHODS\nA
        random sample of patients having a claim for influenza vaccination in the
        study period was selected. Vaccination uptake rates for pneumococcal disease
        and herpes zoster were calculated for previously unvaccinated patients at
        high risk for these conditions. Rates were examined by state-level pharmacist
        privileges.\n\n\nRESULTS\nFor states authorizing immunization by protocol
        or prescriptive authority, the 1-year pneumococcal vaccination uptake rate
        for previously unvaccinated, high-risk persons was 6.6%, compared with 2.5%
        for states requiring a prescription (P <.0001), and 2.8% for states with no
        authorization (P <.0001). For herpes zoster, the 1-year vaccination uptake
        rate was 3.3% for states authorizing per protocol/prescriptive authority,
        compared with 2.8% (not significant, P <.05) for states authorizing by prescription,
        and 1.0% for states with no authorization (P <.0001). A 148% increase of pneumococcal
        vaccination and a 77% increase of herpes zoster vaccination would result if
        all states granted pharmacists full immunization privileges.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis
        analysis demonstrates that states that offer pharmacists full immunization
        privileges have higher vaccination uptake rates than states with restricted
        or no authorization. Considering the suboptimal vaccination rates of pneumonia
        and shingles and the public health goals of 2020, states with limited or no
        immunization authorization for pharmacists should consider expanding pharmacist
        privileges for these vaccinations.", "venue": "American Journal of Managed

        Community Pharmacy: Implications for Increasing Patient Access and Convenience",
        "abstract": "PURPOSE Approximately 50,000 adults die annually from vaccine-preventable
        diseases in the United States. Most traditional vaccine providers (eg, physician
        offices) administer vaccinations during standard clinic hours, but community
        pharmacies offer expanded hours that allow patients to be vaccinated at convenient
        times. We analyzed the types of vaccines administered and patient populations
        vaccinated during off-clinic hours in a national community pharmacy, and their
        implications for vaccination access and convenience. METHODS We retrospectively
        reviewed data for all vaccinations given at the Walgreens pharmacy chain between
        August 2011 and July 2012. The time of vaccination was categorized as occurring
        during traditional hours (9:00 am\u20136:00 pm weekdays) or off-clinic hours,
        consisting of weekday evenings, weekends, and federal holidays. We compared
        demographic characteristics and types of vaccine. We used a logistic regression
        model to identify predictors of being vaccinated during off-clinic hours.
        RESULTS During the study period, pharmacists administered 6,250,402 vaccinations,
        of which 30.5% were provided during off-clinic hours: 17.4% were provided
        on weekends, 10.2% on evenings, and 2.9% on holidays. Patients had significantly
        higher odds of off-clinic vaccination if they were younger than 65 years of
        age, were male, resided in an urban area, and did not have any chronic conditions.
        CONCLUSIONS A large proportion of adults being vaccinated receive their vaccines
        during evening, weekend, and holiday hours at the pharmacy, when traditional
        vaccine providers are likely unavailable. Younger, working-aged, healthy adults,
        in particular, accessed a variety of immunizations during off-clinic hours.
        With the low rates of adult and adolescent vaccination in the United States,
        community pharmacies are creating new opportunities for vaccination that expand
        access and convenience.", "venue": "Annals of Family Medicine", "year": 2013,

        with CABG for failed", "abstract": "Background. Acute closure remains a significant
        limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and underlies
        the majority of ischemic complications. This study details the clinical and
        angiographic characteristics of a series of patients receiving an intracoronary
        stent device to manage acute and threatened closure and presents the early
        clinical results. Methods and Results. From October 1989 through June 1991,
        115 patients undergoing PTCA received intracoronary stents to treat acute
        or threatened closure in 119 vessels. Sixty-three percent had multivessel
        coronary disease, 33 (29%Y7) had undergone prior coronary artery bypass grafting
        (CABG), and 52 (45%) had had previous PTCA. Using the American College of
        Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) classification, 15% of lesions
        were class A, 55% were class B, and 30% were class C. Eight patients were
        referred with severe coronary dissection and unstable angina after PTCA at
        other institutions. Acute closure was defined as occlusion of the vessel with
        TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 0 or 1 flow immediately before
        stent placement. Threatened closure required two or more of the following
        criteria: 1) a residual stenosis greater than 50%o, 2) TIMI grade 2 flow,
        3) angiographic dissection comprising extraluminal dye extravasation and/or
        a length of greater than 15 mm, 4) evidence of clinical ischemia (either typical
        angina or ECG changes). Twelve vessels (10%) met the criteria for acute closure,
        and 87 vessels (73%) satisfied the criteria for threatened closure. Twenty
        vessels (17%) failed to meet two criteria. Stenting produced optimal angiographic
        results in 111 vessels (93%), with mean diameter stenosis (\u00b11 SD) reduced
        from 83\u00b112% before to 18\u00b129% after stenting. Overall, in-hospital
        mortality was 1.7% and CABG was required in 4.2%; Q wave myocardial infarction
        (MI) occurred in 7% and non-Q wave MI in 91%. Stent thrombosis occurred in
        nine patients (7.6%). For the 108 patients who presented to the catheterization
        laboratory without evolving MI, Q wave MI occurred in 4% and non-Q wave MI
        occurred in 7%. Angiographic follow-up has been performed in 81 eligible patients
        (76%), and 34 patients (41%) had a lesion of .50%o. Conclusions. This stent
        may be a useful adjunct to balloon dilatation in acute or threatened closure.

        radioopaque intracoronary stent engineered from a single Tantalum filament
        folded into a sinusoidal helical coil. It is premounted on a semicompliant
        balloon expandable stent delivery system. From September 1995-March 1996,
        147 Cordis stents were deployed in 105 patients (aged 58+/-12 yr, 71% male).
        Clinical indications for stenting were unstable angina in 59 (55%), stable
        angina in 41 (38%), and acute myocardial infarction in 7 (7%). The target
        vessel was the right coronary artery in 45%, the left anterior descending
        in 31%, and the circumflex artery in 22%. One stent was deployed in a vein
        graft, and one stent was deployed in a left internal mammary artery graft.
        Stent deployment was achieved in all but one patient. Acute in-stent thrombosis
        occurred in 3 patients (2.9%). Two of these patients required urgent coronary
        artery bypass surgery. Subacute stent thrombosis occurred in 2 patients (1.9%).
        Minimum lumen diameter increased from 0.70+/-0.41 mm to 3.50+/-0.60 mm following
        stent placement. All patients received aspirin. Eighty-one patients (77%)
        received ticlopidine, and 4 patients (4%) received warfarin therapy. The mean
        hospital stay was 3.4+/-2.3 days. Six-month follow-up angiography was performed
        on 50 out of 55 eligible patients at one of the two institutions involved
        in this study. Computer-assisted quantitative coronary angiography defined
        a restenosis rate of 26%. Repeat revascularization was required in 8 patients
        (14.5%) at 6-mo follow-up. The Tantalum Cordis intracoronary stent is an effective
        and safe means of treating coronary lesions, even in patients with unstable
        ischemic syndromes. Acute and subacute rates of in-stent thrombosis were acceptable,
        and the long-term angiographic restenosis rates and need for repeat revascularization
        were favorable.", "venue": "Catheterization and Cardiovascular Diagnosis",

        "title": "Length of hospital stay and complications after percutaneous transluminal
        coronary angioplasty. Clinical and procedural predictors. Heparin Registry
        Investigators.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nAlthough several studies have established
        that the complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
        are related to clinical and angiographic variables such as advanced age and
        lesion complexity, it is uncertain whether the use of hospital resources after
        PTCA also depends on the same baseline variables. The purpose of this study
        was to identify the factors responsible for prolonged hospital stay after
        PTCA.\n\n\nMETHODS AND RESULTS\nThe study cohort included 591 consecutive
        patients undergoing conventional balloon angioplasty at nine medical centers
        in North America. Major or minor complications occurred in 91 patients (15.4%)
        and were observed to be related to several baseline characteristics, including
        unstable angina, multivessel coronary artery disease, patient age, and lesion
        complexity. Compared with a median length of hospital stay of 2.0 days after
        PTCA (25th, 75th percentiles: 2.0, 4.0) for the entire cohort of patients,
        the length of stay was increased in patients with unstable angina (3.0 days
        [2.0, 5.0]; P = .002), multivessel coronary artery disease (3.0 [2.0, 5.5];
        P = .001), age > 65 years (3.0 [2.0, 5.5]; P = .02), complex lesions (3.0
        [2.0, 6.0]; P = .001), and filling defects (6.0 [2.0, 11.0]; P < .001). The
        length of stay was more strikingly increased, however, in patients who experienced
        major or minor PTCA complications, such as emergency bypass surgery (9.0 days
        [8.0, 18.0]; P < .001), Q-wave or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (8.0 [6.0,
        15.5]; P < .001), transfusion unrelated to bypass surgery (8.0 [4.0, 12.0];
        P < .001), or abrupt vessel closure (6.0 [3.0, 10.5]; P < .001). On stepwise
        multiple linear regression, PTCA complications appeared to be the strongest
        predictors of length of hospital stay (all P < .001) and overwhelmed the weaker
        relation between length of stay and several individual baseline variables.
        Inclusion of a composite clinical risk score (reflecting the presence of unstable
        angina, multivessel disease, advanced age, complex lesions, or filling defects)
        in the regression model confirmed that patients with several high-risk baseline
        variables had a significant increase in length of stay after PTCA (P = .003),
        but PTCA complications remained the strongest predictors of length of stay.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAlthough
        PTCA complications were correlated with baseline variables such as unstable
        angina, multivessel disease, advanced age, complex lesions, and filling defects,
        excess length of stay after PTCA was most strongly influenced by the development
        of minor and major PTCA complications. Because patients with several baseline
        risk factors experienced significantly prolonged hospitalizations, improved
        selection of patients may contribute to reductions in length of stay after
        PTCA. A greater reduction in resource use after PTCA, however, would be expected
        from developing new treatments to decrease PTCA complications rather than
        limiting the access of patients with unstable angina, advanced age, or complex
        lesions to PTCA.", "venue": "Circulation", "year": 1995, "referenceCount":

        "title": "Intracoronary Stenting for Acute and Threatened Closure Complicating
        Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty", "abstract": "BackgroundAcute
        closure remains a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary
        angioplasty (PTCA) and underlies the majority of ischemic complications. This
        study details the clinical and angiographic characteristics of a series of
        patients receiving an intracoronary stent device to manage acute and threatened
        closure and presents the early clinical results. Methods and ResultsFrom October
        1989 through June 1991, 115 patients undergoing PTCA received intracoronary
        stents to treat acute or threatened closure in 119 vessels. Sixty-three percent
        had multivessel coronary disease, 33 (29%) had undergone prior coronary artery
        bypass grafting (CABG), and 52 (45%) had had previous PTCA. Using the American
        College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) classification,
        15% of lesions were class A, 55% were class B, and 30% were class C. Eight
        patients were referred with severe coronary dissection and unstable angina
        after PTCA at other institutions. Acute closure was defined as occlusion of
        the vessel with TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) 0 or 1 flow immediately
        before stent placement. Threatened closure required two or more of the following
        criteria: 1) a residual stenosis greater than 50%, 2) TIMI grade 2 flow, 3)
        angiographic dissection comprising extraluminal dye extravasation and/or a
        length of greater than 15 mm, 4) evidence of clinical ischemia (either typical
        angina or ECG changes). Twelve vessels (10%) met the criteria for acute closure,
        and 87 vessels (73%) satisfied the criteria for threatened closure. Twenty
        vessels (17%) failed to meet two criteria. Stenting produced optimal angiographic
        results in 111 vessels (93%), with mean diameter stenosis (\u00b11 SD) reduced
        from 83\u00b112% before to 18\u00b129% after stenting. Overall, in-hospital
        mortality was 1.7% and CABG was required in 4.2%; Q wave myocardial infarction
        (MI) occurred in 7% and non-Q wave MI in 91%. Stent thrombosis occurred in
        nine patients (7.6%). For the 108 patients who presented to the catheterization
        laboratory without evolving MI, Q wave MI occurred in 4% and non-Q wave MI
        occurred in 7%. Angiographic follow-up has been performed in 81 eligible patients
        (76%), and 34 patients (41%) had a lesion of .50%. ConclusionsThis stent may
        be a useful adjunct to balloon dilatation in acute or threatened closure.
        Randomized studies comparing this stent with alternative technologies are
        required.", "venue": "Circulation", "year": 1992, "referenceCount": 44, "citationCount":

        a part in this increase? This poster presents our evaluation data, which indicates
        that CESP increased enrollment in the computer science major, especially for
        women. Students who took CESP along with the introduction to computer programming
        course in 2009-10 were three times more likely to major in computer science
        the following year than the students who took introduction to programming
        without CESP. 47% of CESP students subsequently chose the computer science
        major. In addition, survey results indicated that a large majority of students
        intended to take another computer science course, were enthusiastic about
        the program, and found the workshop topics exciting and engaging. Participants

        Team Learning (PLTL) approach has previously been shown to be effective in
        recruiting and retaining students, particularly under-represented students,
        in undergraduate introductory CS courses. In PLTL, small groups of students
        are led by an undergraduate peer and work together to solve problems related
        to CS. At Columbia University, the Columbia Emerging Scholars Program has
        used PLTL in an effort to increase enrollment in CS courses beyond the introductory
        level, and to increase the number of students who select Computer Science
        as their major, by demonstrating that CS is necessarily a collaborative activity
        that focuses more on problem solving and algorithmic thinking than on programming.
        Over the past six semesters, over 80 students have completed the program,
        and preliminary results indicate that this program has had a positive effect
        on increasing participation in the major. This paper discusses our experiences
        of building and expanding the Columbia Emerging Scholars program, and addresses
        such topics as recruiting, training, scheduling, student behavior, and evaluation.

        to provide a framework for studying the trade-offs between performance and

        dissertation investigates theoretical and experimental aspects of a set of
        classification methods based on approximate point to subset distances. Chapter
        1 introduces the classification problem, gives background and notation. In
        Chapter 2, a classifier is presented based on the 1997 Cowen and Priebe ADC
        non-linear projections, and its performance is tested on some benchmark data
        sets. Chapter 3 is motivated by the idea of deterministically constructing
        ADC projections to a single dimension that preserve interclass separation
        in a 2-class setting. In it, the \u201cClass Cover\u201d problem is formulated,
        and complexity results and polynomial time approximation algorithms for this
        problem are presented. The final chapter investigates theoretical properties
        of a new general class of classifiers based on a generalization to subset
        ranks of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank statistics studied by Priebe, Cowen
        and Xie. The consistency of a fairly general class of classification rules

        "title": "Scylla and Charybdis: the Army''s Development of War Plan Orange",
        "abstract": "Abstract : Planning for hypothetical wars represented one of
        the most daunting challenges for the Army in the interwar years (1919-1941).
        A challenging strategic environment, a weak force lacking in significant capability,
        and no unified national security apparatus all combined to limit the options
        available to the Army''s War Plans Division. War Plan Orange, the plan to
        defeat Japan, emerged as the most likely contingency and received the greatest
        emphasis for development. Published in 1924, 1928, and 1938, War Plan Orange
        evolved in response to changes in the strategic environment and inherent constraints
        placed on the planners. This monograph examines how the planners of the Army
        War Plans Division developed their contribution to the overall conception
        of War Plan Orange. By placing the plans within the context in which they
        developed like the strategic environment, the condition of the army, and the
        deliberations surrounding its development, a comprehensive picture of the
        plan emerges. This picture allows for a reasoned evaluation of the feasibility
        of the plan. Rather than make comparisons with Japanese capabilities and the
        likelihood of success against the Japanese, this monograph solely examines
        the initial objectives sought by the plan, and if they were achievable given
        the condition of the Army. The War Plans Division produced plans of increasing
        feasibility during the interwar years. In the 1924 plan, through a combination
        of faulty assumptions and wishful thinking, the War Plans Division created
        an impractical plan in response to political pressure to immediately relieve
        the Philippines. The 1928 Plan, while marginally better, prescribed a rigid
        course of action the force commander would take to relieve the Philippines.
        Only the 1938 plan presented a plan that was within the capabilities of the
        Army, and allowed the force commander the flexibility to act according to
        his discretion.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount": 13, "citationCount":
