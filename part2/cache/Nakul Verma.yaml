        "title": "Effective Wellbore Cleanup and Improvement of Injection Performance
        and Conformance Using Coil Tubing Conveyed Tool for Waveform Dominated Fluid
        Dispersion and Pin-Point Chemical Placement During Well Stimulation", "abstract":
        "\n Poor conformance is a major concern of Mangala, Bhagyam & Aishwarya (MBA)
        fields. The presence of high permeability streaks or thief layers between
        injection and production wells typically results in pre-mature water breakthrough,
        high water cut and deficient volumetric sweep. As a result, significant oil
        volumes in the reservoir may not be contacted by the injection fluid. Another
        concern is of low VRR (Voidage Replacement Ratio) in some of the layers due
        to reduced injectivity in those sands. Consequently, it has led to poor recovery
        from those sands. It is also a growing problem with the polymer deposition
        taking place in the wellbore particularly Mangala (undergoing full-field polymer
        flooding), leading to challenging wellbore cleanup operations.\n Several methods
        have been used in the past, both mechanical and chemical to improve the treatment
        fluids during stimulation. In this paper, we introduce a novel placement technique
        for Conformance Improvement which is practical, effective and durable as well
        as another tool variant that helps cleanup challenging wellbore environments.
        Typically, prior to the tool allowing for pin-point placement, the adjustable
        nozzle tool is run to ensure that the perforation and wellbore is cleaned
        up thoroughly with help of advanced fluid dynamics. The dynamic injection
        modulation (hereinafter referred to as, \"DIM\") tool for pin-point stimulation
        placement improves the distribution of injected fluid in the reservoir matrix
        by the process of dispersion. The tool generates an energized fluid pulse
        that allows fluid to be diverted away from established fluid paths. The pressure
        pulse, as it travels dilates the pore spaces thus propagating the wave further
        into the reservoir. The pin-point accuracy of placements leads to treating
        of reservoir layers which are left untreated during conventional stimulation
        treatments where viscous fingering effects dominate. As a result, injection
        fluid would divert into uncontacted layers to improve sweep efficiency. The
        other advantage of the tool is the relatively easy integration of tool with
        existing infrastructure. The tool is easily run with coiled tubing (\"CT\")
        with only addition of an accumulator unit on surface.\n This paper will document
        the tool physics, job design and Implementation technique for stimulation
        using Fluid Modulation tool as well enhanced well cleanup. Particular attention
        is paid to multiple injector and producer well stimulation case studies from
        these fields, the challenges faced, the solution proposed, and finally the
        results obtained. The results observed across the field with respect to injection
        performance is consistently greater than 75% over conventional methods used
        earlier. Also specifically, in scenarios of difficult fill cleanups, the advanced
        wellbore cleanup tool variant helped in multiple polymer and sand fill environment
        cleanouts over various wells over conventional methods of cleanup.", "venue":

        can be seamlessly incorporated into vehicles. This thesis comprises two projects
        that address some of the engineering challenges associated with practical
        implementation of magnetorheological bushings in cars. The first project investigates
        the dynamic vibration damping range of an elastomer ferromagnet composite
        damper, a type of magnetorheological material, under realizable electromagnetic
        control. The dynamic vibration damping range of the elastomer ferromagnet
        damper is acquired from the resonant frequency change of a vibrated proof
        mass comprising the elastomer ferromagnet component and a pair of off-the-shelf
        industrial electromagnets. The second project in this thesis models power
        amplifiers that are needed to power electromagnets coupled to magnetorheological
        bushings in an automobile.", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "referenceCount":

        "abstract": "Modern neural network architectures have shown remarkable success
        in several large-scale classification and prediction tasks. Part of the success
        of these architectures is their flexibility to transform the data from the
        raw input representations (e.g. pixels for vision tasks, or text for natural
        language processing tasks) to one-hot output encoding. While much of the work
        has focused on studying how the input gets transformed to the one-hot encoding,
        very little work has examined the effectiveness of these one-hot labels. In
        this work, we demonstrate that more sophisticated label representations are
        better for classification than the usual one-hot encoding. We propose Learning
        with Adaptive Labels (LwAL) algorithm, which simultaneously learns the label
        representation while training for the classification task. These learned labels
        can significantly cut down on the training time (usually by more than 50%)
        while often achieving better test accuracies. Our algorithm introduces negligible
        additional parameters and has a minimal computational overhead. Along with
        improved training times, our learned labels are semantically meaningful and
        can reveal hierarchical relationships that may be present in the data.", "venue":

        "One of the most exciting applications of modern artificial intelligence is
        to automatically discover scientific laws from experimental data. This is
        not a trivial problem as it involves searching for a complex mathematical
        relationship over a large set of explanatory variables and operators that
        can be combined in an infinite number of ways.\n\nInspired by the incredible
        success of deep learning in computer vision, we tackle this problem by adapting
        various successful network architectures into the symbolic law discovery pipeline.
        The novelty of our approach is in (1) encoding the input data as an image
        with super-resolution, (2) developing an appropriate deep network pipeline,
        and (3) predicting the importance of each mathematical operator from the relationship
        image. This allows us to prior the exponentially large search with the predicted

        Yet, the basic approach to clustering has not really changed: a practitioner
        hand-picks a task-specific clustering loss to optimize and fit the given data
        to reveal the underlying cluster structure. Some types of losses---such as
        k-means, or its non-linear version: kernelized k-means (centroid based), and
        DBSCAN (density based)---are popular choices due to their good empirical performance
        on a range of applications. Although every so often the clustering output
        using these standard losses fails to reveal the underlying structure, and
        the practitioner has to custom-design their own variation. In this work we
        take an intrinsically different approach to clustering: rather than fitting
        a dataset to a specific clustering loss, we train a recurrent model that learns
        how to cluster. The model uses as training pairs examples of datasets (as
        input) and its corresponding cluster identities (as output). By providing
        multiple types of training datasets as inputs, our model has the ability to
        generalize well on unseen datasets (new clustering tasks). Our experiments
        reveal that by training on simple synthetically generated datasets or on existing

        by analyzing the temporal dynamics of the optimization procedure via the Runge-Kutta

        learning involves designing algorithms that do not discriminate with respect

        operates under the assumption that the sensitive feature available in one''s

        many real-world cases: for example, respondents to a survey may choose to
        conceal or obfuscate their group identity out of fear of potential discrimination.
        This poses the question of whether one can still learn fair classifiers given
        noisy sensitive features. In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative:
        we show that if one measures fairness using the mean-difference score, and
        sensitive features are subject to noise from the mutually contaminated learning
        model, then owing to a simple identity we only need to change the desired

        "title": "Time-Accuracy Tradeoffs in Kernel Prediction: Controlling Prediction
        Quality", "abstract": "Kernel regression or classification (also referred
        to as weighted e-NN methods in Machine Learning) are appealing for their simplicity
        and therefore ubiquitous in data analysis. However, practical implementations
        of kernel regression or classification consist of quantizing or sub-sampling
        data for improving time efficiency, often at the cost of prediction quality.
        While such tradeoffs are necessary in practice, their statistical implications
        are generally not well understood, hence practical implementations come with
        few performance guarantees. In particular, it is unclear whether it is possible
        to maintain the statistical accuracy of kernel prediction--crucial in some
        applications--while improving prediction time. \n \nThe present work provides
        guiding principles for combining kernel prediction with data-quantization
        so as to guarantee good tradeoffs between prediction time and accuracy, and
        in particular so as to approximately maintain the good accuracy of vanilla
        kernel prediction. Furthermore, our tradeoff guarantees are worked out explicitly
        in terms of a tuning parameter which acts as a knob that favors either time
        or accuracy depending on practical needs. On one end of the knob, prediction
        time is of the same order as that of single-nearestneighbor prediction (which
        is statistically inconsistent) while maintaining consistency; on the other
        end of the knob, the prediction risk is nearly minimax-optimal (in terms of
        the original data size) while still reducing time complexity. The analysis
        thus reveals the interaction between the data-quantization approach and the
        kernel prediction method, and most importantly gives explicit control of the
        tradeoff to the practitioner rather than fixing the tradeoff in advance or
        leaving it opaque. \n \nThe theoretical results are validated on data from
        a range of real-world application domains; in particular we demonstrate that
        the theoretical knob performs as expected.", "venue": "Journal of machine

        conditions such as asthma and cancer. Yet, medical and public health practitioners
        typically must depend on sparse regional measurements of the environment that

        sensing system that bridges the gap between personal sensing and regional
        measurement to provide micro-level detail at a regional scale. In a user study
        of 16 commuters using CitiSense, measurements were found to vary significantly
        from those provided by official regional pollution monitoring stations. Moreover,
        applying geostatistical kriging techniques to our data allows CitiSense to

        information explosion of the past few decades has created tremendous opportunities
        for Machine Learning-based data analysis. Modern data typically possesses
        a large number of features. Consider the task of predicting the effectiveness
        of a particular treatment by analyzing a patient''s genome. One hopes that
        by measuring several gene expression levels one can capture relevant information,
        leading to better predictions. However, the presence of a large number of
        irrelevant features adds to the statistical and computational complexity of
        the learning algorithm, without helping the practitioner to solve the task
        at hand. Indeed, conventional statistical wisdom suggests that in a general
        setting the learning task becomes significantly more difficult with an increase
        in the number of features, making it especially difficult to design and analyze
        learning algorithms for modern, high-dimensional data. \nThis dissertation
        explores a specific way one can cope with this curse of dimension. The key
        observation is that while modern datasets are represented in high dimensions,
        they often adhere to some low-dimensional intrinsic structure. This intrinsic
        structure can manifest itself in several forms: some datasets such as text
        data have a sparse structure; other datasets such as speech and image articulation
        data follow a manifold structure. If this intrinsic structure is in fact low-dimensional
        (that is, has few degrees of freedom), then the complexity of learning algorithms
        should scale only with data''s intrinsic dimensionality. \nIn the first part
        of this dissertation we study how the performance of learning algorithms is
        affected when the data have a low-dimensional manifold structure. We provide
        sharp bounds for unsupervised dimensionality reduction, and an improved PAC-learning
        framework for multiple instance learning in this setting. \nThe second part
        of this dissertation focuses on understanding and formalizing the general
        phenomenon of low intrinsic dimension. We explore a few notions that can effectively
        quantify low-dimensional geometric structure in data. We show that unlike
        traditional notions, some of the new notions are algorithmically verifiable.
        We can thus test a given dataset and guarantee a learning rate that scales
        only with its intrinsic dimension.", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "referenceCount":

        many machine learning applications, labeling every instance of data is burdensome.
        Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), in which training data is provided in the
        form of labeled bags rather than labeled instances, is one approach for a
        more relaxed form of supervised learning. Though much progress has been made
        in analyzing MIL problems, existing work considers bags that have a finite
        number of instances. In this paper we argue that in many applications of MIL
        (e.g. image, audio, etc.) the bags are better modeled as low dimensional manifolds
        in high dimensional feature space. We show that the geometric structure of
        such manifold bags affects PAC-learnability. We discuss how a learning algorithm
        that is designed for finite sized bags can be adapted to learn from manifold

        "abstract": "Recovering missing sensor data is a critical problem for sensor
        networks, especially when nodes duty cycle their activity or may experience
        periodic downtimes due to limited energy. Fortunately, sensor readings are
        often correlated across different nodes and sensor types. Among state-of-the-art
        statistical data estimation techniques, latent variable based factor models
        have emerged as a powerful framework for recovering missing data. In this
        paper we propose the use of latent variable models to estimate missing data
        in heterogeneous sensor networks. Our model not only correlates data across
        different sensor locations and types, but also takes advantage of the temporal
        structure that is often present in sensor readings. We analyze how this model
        can effectively reconstruct missing sensor data when the individual sensor
        nodes have to duty-cycle their activity in order to extend network lifetime.
        We evaluate our model on a real life sensor network consisting of 122 environmental
        monitoring stations that periodically collect data from 13 different sensors.
        Results show that our proposed model can effectively reconstruct over 50%
        of missing data with less than 10% error.", "venue": "2011 Seventh International

        to. By utilizing mobile phones and affordable, small sensors placed in the
        environment and carried by users, data about pollutants such as ozone and
        carbon monoxide is collected and used to provide real-time feedback to users
        and enable them to make healthy changes in their behavior. Results can be
        reported to a back-end server for further processing and learning, allowing
        other stakeholders to better understand how diseases such as asthma develop
        and to help coordinate efforts within a user''s community to improve conditions.
        What differentiates CitiSense from previous projects of this sort is the design
        of a complete system that addresses issues of mobile power management, data
        security, privacy, inference with commodity sensors, and integration into
        a highly extensible and adaptive infrastructure comprising of Open Rich Services

        "abstract": "Modern databases support queries that perform model inference
        (inference queries). Although powerful and widely used, inference queries
        are susceptible to incorrect results if the model is biased due to training
        data errors. Recently, prior work Rain proposed complaint-driven data debugging
        which uses user-specified errors in the output of inference queries (Complaints)
        to rank erroneous training examples that most likely caused the complaint.
        This can help users better interpret results and debug training sets. Rain
        combined influence analysis from the ML literature with relaxed query provenance
        polynomials from the DB literature to approximate the derivative of complaints
        w.r.t. training examples. Although effective, the runtime is O(|T|d), where
        T and d are the training set and model sizes, due to its reliance on the model''s
        second order derivatives (the Hessian). On a Wide Resnet Network (WRN) model
        with 1.5 million parameters, it takes >1 minute to debug a complaint. We observe
        that most complaint debugging costs are independent of the complaint, and
        that modern models are overparameterized. In response, Rain++ uses precomputation
        techniques, based on non-trivial insights unique to data debugging, to reduce
        debugging latencies to a constant factor independent of model size. We also
        develop optimizations when the queried database is known apriori, and for
        standing queries over streaming databases. Combining these optimizations in
        Rain++ ensures interactive debugging latencies (~1ms) on models with millions

        The latter is more challenging because the test/inference-time data used in
        the application could be quite different from the training data. To address
        this challenge, we advocate for \"complaint-driven\" data debugging, which
        allows the user to complain about the unexpected behaviors of the model in
        the downstream application, and proposes interventions for training data errors
        that likely led to the complaints. This new debugging paradigm helps solve

        about using machine learning to predict human capital. We randomly assign
        approximately 400 AI engineers to develop software under different experimental
        conditions to predict standardized test scores of OECD residents. We then
        assess the resulting predictive algorithms using the realized test performances,
        and through randomized audit-like manipulations of algorithmic inputs. We
        also used the diversity of our subject population to measure whether demographically
        non-traditional engineers were more likely to notice and reduce algorithmic
        bias, and whether algorithmic prediction errors are correlated within programmer
        demographic groups. This document describes our experimental design and motivation;

        "title": "Motor cortex is an input-driven dynamical system controlling dexterous
        movement", "abstract": "Skillful control of movement is central to our ability
        to sense and manipulate the world. A large body of work in nonhuman primates
        has demonstrated that motor cortex provides flexible, time-varying activity
        patterns that control the arm during reaching and grasping. Previous studies
        have suggested that these patterns are generated by strong local recurrent
        dynamics operating autonomously from inputs during movement execution. An
        alternative possibility is that motor cortex requires coordination with upstream
        brain regions throughout the entire movement in order to yield these patterns.
        Here, we developed an experimental preparation in the mouse to directly test
        these possibilities using optogenetics and electrophysiology during a skilled
        reach-to-grab-to-eat task. To validate this preparation, we first established
        that a specific, time-varying pattern of motor cortical activity was required
        to produce coordinated movement. Next, in order to disentangle the contribution
        of local recurrent motor cortical dynamics from external input, we optogenetically
        held the recurrent contribution constant, then observed how motor cortical
        activity recovered following the end of this perturbation. Both the neural
        responses and hand trajectory varied from trial to trial, and this variability
        reflected variability in external inputs. To directly probe the role of these
        inputs, we used optogenetics to perturb activity in the thalamus. Thalamic
        perturbation at the start of the trial prevented movement initiation, and
        perturbation at any stage of the movement prevented progression of the hand
        to the target; this demonstrates that input is required throughout the movement.
        By comparing motor cortical activity with and without thalamic perturbation,
        we were able to estimate the effects of external inputs on motor cortical
        population activity. Thus, unlike pattern-generating circuits that are local
        and autonomous, such as those in the spinal cord that generate left-right
        alternation during locomotion, the pattern generator for reaching and grasping
        is distributed across multiple, strongly-interacting brain regions.", "venue":

        "title": "The cortical dynamics orchestrating skilled prehension", "abstract":
        "Skillful control of movement is central to our ability to sense and manipulate
        the world. Dexterous acts depend on cerebral cortex, and the activity of cortical
        neurons is correlated with movement. By isolating the neural dynamics that
        command skilled movements from those that reflect other processes (such as
        planning and deciding to move), we were able to characterize and manipulate
        the motor commands underlying prehension. We showed that in mice trained to
        perform a reach / grab / supination / bring-to-mouth sequence (volitional
        prehension), multiple forms of optogenetic stimuli in sensorimotor cortex
        resulted in an involuntary, complete movement (opto-prehension). This result
        suggested that the trained brain could robustly transform a variety of aberrant
        stimuli into the dynamics sufficient for prehension. We measured the electrical
        activity of cortical populations and detailed limb kinematics during volitional
        prehension and opto-prehension. During volitional prehension, neurons fired
        before and during specific stages of the movement, and the population collectively
        tiled the entire behavioral sequence. During opto-prehension, most neurons
        recapitulated their volitional prehension activity patterns, but a physiologically
        distinct subset did not. On trials where the liminal optogenetic stimulus
        failed to produce these dynamics, movement did not occur, providing further
        evidence that a specific pattern of neural activity was causally coupled to
        prehension. Having identified these dynamics, we next tested their robustness
        to brief, closed-loop perturbation. Regardless of where along the reach we
        optogenetically halted cortical activity and the movement, relief of suppression
        resulted in cortical dynamics that immediately recapitulated all steps of
        the prehension program, and the animal completed the behavior. By combining
        electrophysiology and optogenetic perturbations, we have identified and characterized
        the cortical motor program driving a learned, dexterous movement sequence.",
