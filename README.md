## Note: most of the data in the Database is real and was obtained through the Semantic Scholar API
## However, some data wasn't available easily (particularly citations data), so the citations between
## papers ARE MADE UP AND DO NOT CORRESPOND TO REALITY. Obviously, any data related to website
## users is also made up!!
