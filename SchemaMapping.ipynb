    "# Project Proposal\n",
    "1. We aim to make a website that allows users to explore scientific literature and perform literature review through browsing entities and relationships such as papers, authors, publications, institutions, co-authorship & citation relationship graphs, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. We will do the web front-end option. Users will interact with our application by searching for papers/authors, and our website will provide papers in the paper's local citation network (papers that cite/are cited by the paper), and authors in the author’s local co-authorship network (authors that have co-authored with the author).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our website will also show more data for papers/authors such as author affiliation, paper publication date, abstract, url, venue, and DOI identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Users will be able to create “collections” of papers, which will show up on their profile.\n",
    "The incomplete ER diagram for our project."

    "# Data Plan\n",
    "1. We plan to populate our database with data from datasets provided by the Semantic Scholar API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. These datasets contain large amounts of data for most of the entities/relationship sets in our scope, which we will parse to extract the fields and populate our database.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We may enrich this data with additional \"fake attributes\" (generated by us) in case they don't have some information we would like to show.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We might not use the entire datasets, as they are very large (>50 Gb) and may go beyond our database resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Website user data (usernames, emails…) will be invented manually, or generated randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. We might refine the ER diagram while we parse the data, in case we find an integrity constrait that wasn't added, or realize we added an integrity constraint that the data does not obey.\n",
